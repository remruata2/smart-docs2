CHAPTER 4

Parts of Speech
Chapter 4: Parts of Speech
Introduction: The Architecture of Language
Language, much like a grand edifice, requires specific materials and structural rules to stand
firm and convey meaning effectively. In the English language, these fundamental materials are
known as the Parts of Speech. Just as a civil engineer must understand the properties of
concrete, steel, and glass to build a bridge, an aspirant of the Civil Services must master the eight
parts of speech to construct arguments, draft policies, and articulate nuanced thoughts with
precision.
In the context of the MPSC and UPSC Main examinations, understanding Parts of Speech is not
merely an academic exercise in labeling words; it is about understanding Functional
Grammar. Words are categorized not by what they look like, but by what they do in a sentence.
The word "water" can be a Noun in one context ("I need water") and a Verb in another ("I water
the plants"). This chapter provides an exhaustive, deep-dive analysis of these categories, moving
far beyond school-level definitions to the sophisticated nuances required for high-level
administrative communication.

1. The Noun: The Naming Word
1.1 Formal Definition and Function
A Noun (from the Latin nomen, meaning name) is a word used as the name of a person, place,
thing, animal, feeling, or idea. Syntactically, nouns function as the subject of a verb, the object of
a verb, or the object of a preposition. They are the anchors of a sentence, providing the "who" or
"what" that the sentence is about.

1.2 Classification of Nouns
Nouns are broadly classified into five major categories. Understanding these distinctions is vital
for applying rules of articles and verb agreement.
1.2.1 Proper Noun
A Proper Noun is the specific, unique name given to a particular person, place, or organization.
Key Feature: Always capitalized.
Examples: Mumbai, Shivaji Maharaj, The Godavari, Microsoft.

Exam Nuance: generally, articles are not used before proper nouns. However, when a
proper noun is used to indicate a type or quality possessed by a famous entity, it functions as
a common noun and takes an article.
Standard: "Kalidas was a great poet."
Descriptive: "Kalidas is the Shakespeare of India." (Here, 'Shakespeare' implies
'greatest dramatist').
1.2.2 Common Noun
A Common Noun is a name given in common to every person or thing of the same class or
kind.
Examples: city, king, river, company, officer.
Analogy: If 'Tata Nexon' is the Proper Noun, 'Car' is the Common Noun.
1.2.3 Collective Noun
A Collective Noun refers to a group or collection of persons or things taken together and
spoken of as one whole.
Examples: Crowd, Mob, Team, Flock, Herd, Army, Fleet, Jury, Family, Parliament.
Subject-Verb Agreement Rule:
When the group acts as a single unit, use a singular verb. (e.g., "The jury has given its
verdict.")
When the members of the group are acting individually, use a plural verb. (e.g., "The
jury were divided in their opinions.")
1.2.4 Material Noun
A Material Noun denotes the matter or substance of which things are made.
Examples: Gold, Iron, Wood, Clay, Cotton, Milk.
Exam Tip: Material nouns are generally uncountable. You cannot say "a gold" or "two
milks". Consequently, they usually do not take the indefinite articles 'a' or 'an'.
1.2.5 Abstract Noun
An Abstract Noun is the name of a quality, action, or state considered apart from the object to
which it belongs. These are things you cannot touch or see but can feel or understand.
Quality: Goodness, Kindness, Whiteness, Darkness, Hardness, Brightness, Honesty.

Action: Laughter, Theft, Movement, Judgment, Hatred.
State: Childhood, Boyhood, Youth, Slavery, Sleep, Sickness, Death, Poverty.

1.3 Gender and Number in Nouns
While often simple, MPSC creates trick questions based on foreign plurals and gender-specific
roles.

2. The Pronoun: The Substitute
2.1 Definition and Utility
A Pronoun (from Latin pro meaning 'for', and nomen meaning 'name') is a word used instead
of a noun. Its primary utility is economy and variety; it prevents the monotonous repetition of
the noun.
Without Pronouns: "Suresh did not come because Suresh was ill." With Pronouns: "Suresh did
not come because he was ill."

2.2 Types of Pronouns
2.2.1 Personal Pronouns
These stand for the three persons:
1. First Person: The person speaking (I, We).
2. Second Person: The person spoken to (You).
3. Third Person: The person spoken of (He, She, It, They).

Pitfall Alert: Confusing It's (It is) with Its (Possessive). "The dog wagged its tail" (Correct).
"The dog wagged it's tail" (Incorrect).
2.2.2 Reflexive and Emphatic Pronouns
These end in -self or -selves.
Reflexive: The action of the subject turns back on the subject.
Example: "I hurt myself."
Emphatic: Used to emphasize the noun.
Example: "I myself saw him do it."
2.2.3 Demonstrative Pronouns
Used to point out the objects to which they refer.
This, That, These, Those.
Example: "This is the present from my uncle."
2.2.4 Indefinite Pronouns
Refer to persons or things in a general way, not to any particular person.
One, None, All, Some, Somebody, Nobody, Few, Many, Others.

Example: "One must do one's duty." (Note: Not 'his' duty).
2.2.5 Relative Pronouns
These relate to some noun going before (antecedent) and join two sentences.
Who, Which, That, Whom, Whose.
Example: "The man who came yesterday is a fraud."
2.2.6 Distributive Pronouns
Refer to persons or things one at a time.
Each, Either, Neither.
Rule: They are always singular and followed by a singular verb.
Example: "Each of the boys gets a prize."

3. The Verb: The Engine of Language
3.1 Introduction
The Verb (Latin verbum, meaning 'the word') is the most important part of speech. It asserts
something about a subject. It can express an action (run, write), a state of being (is, was), or
possession (has, have).

3.2 Transitive and Intransitive Verbs
Transitive Verb: The action passes from the Subject to an Object.
Structure: Subject + Verb + Object.
Example: "The policeman caught the thief." (Action passes from policeman to thief).
Intransitive Verb: The action stops with the agent; there is no object.
Example: "The sun shines." (No object required).
Ambitransitive: Some verbs can be both.
Transitive: "He flies a kite."
Intransitive: "Birds fly."

3.3 Verbs of Incomplete Predication
Some intransitive verbs require a word to complete the sense. This word is called the
Complement.

Example: "The baby seems..." (Incomplete). "The baby seems happy." ('Happy' is the
Complement).
Common verbs of this type: be, become, seem, appear, look, grow, turn.

3.4 Verb of Person and Number
The verb must agree with its Subject in Number and Person.
Singular Subject: "The boy plays."
Plural Subject: "The boys play."
Rule of Proximity: In constructions like "Either... or", the verb agrees with the nearest
subject. "Either he or I am mistaken."

3.5 The Infinite, Participle, and Gerund (Non-Finite Verbs)
These are verbs that do not limit themselves to a subject; they have features of other parts of
speech.
3.5.1 The Infinitive (Verb-Noun)
Form: Generally To + Verb (e.g., to err, to forgive). Sometimes used without 'to' (Bare
Infinitive) after modals like can, must, let, make.
Function: Acts as a Noun.
Subject: "To err is human."
Object: "Birds love to sing."
3.5.2 The Participle (Verbal Adjective)
It partakes of the nature of both a Verb and an Adjective.
1. Present Participle: Ends in -ing. Represents continuing action.
Example: "I saw a burning house." (Describes the house).
2. Past Participle: Ends in -ed, -en, -t. Represents completed action.
Example: "A burnt child dreads the fire."
3. Perfect Participle: Having + Past Participle.
Example: "Having rested, we continued our journey."

3.5.3 The Gerund (Verb-Noun)
Like the Infinitive, it is a Verbal Noun, but it ends in -ing.
Example: "Swimming is a good exercise."
Differentiation:
Gerund: "The old man is tired of walking." (Object of preposition 'of').
Participle: "I saw the old man walking." (Adjective describing the man).

3.6 Auxiliaries and Modals
Auxiliary verbs "help" the main verb to form tenses, moods, or voices.
1. Primary Auxiliaries: Be, Have, Do. Can function as main verbs too.
2. Modal Auxiliaries: Can, Could, May, Might, Shall, Should, Will, Would, Must, Ought.
They express concepts like ability, permission, possibility, or obligation.
Rule: Modals are never followed by 'to' (except ought and used). Incorrect: "He can to do
it." Correct: "He can do it."

3.7 Conjugation of the Verb 'Love'
To master tenses, one must understand conjugation. Below is the Active Voice conjugation for
the First Person Singular (I).

4. The Adjective: The Decorator
4.1 Definition and Classification
An Adjective adds something to the meaning of a Noun. It restricts or modifies the noun's
scope.
Types of Adjectives:
1. Adjectives of Quality: Describe the kind or quality (Large city, Honest man).
2. Adjectives of Quantity: Show how much (Some rice, Little patience).
3. Adjectives of Number: Show how many (Five fingers, Several mistakes).
4. Demonstrative Adjectives: Point out which person or thing (This boy, That tree).
5. Distributive Adjectives: Refer to each one of a number (Each boy, Every day).
6. Interrogative Adjectives: Used with nouns to ask questions (Which way? Whose book?).

4.2 Degrees of Comparison
Adjectives change form to show comparison.
1. Positive: Simple quality (Sweet).
2. Comparative: Higher degree, used for two items (Sweeter).
3. Superlative: Highest degree, used for more than two (Sweetest).

Irregular Comparisons (Crucial for Exams):
Good, Better, Best
Bad/Ill/Evil, Worse, Worst
Little, Less/Lesser, Least
Much/Many, More, Most
Far, Farther (distance), Farthest
Far, Further (additional), Furthest
Old, Older/Elder, Oldest/Eldest

4.3 Correct Use of Specific Adjectives
Later vs Latter: Later refers to time; Latter refers to position/order.
Elder vs Older: Elder is for family members (never followed by 'than'); Older is general for
people and things.
Further vs Farther: Farther is physical distance; Further means 'additional' (e.g., "further
instructions").
Nearest vs Next: Nearest denotes distance; Next denotes position.

4.4 Position of Adjectives
Attributive Use: Placed immediately before the noun. "A great king."
Predicative Use: Placed after the verb. "The king was great."

5. The Adverb: The Modifier
5.1 Definition
An Adverb is a word that modifies the meaning of a Verb, an Adjective, or another Adverb. It
answers questions like How? When? Where? and To what extent?
Modifying Verb: "He runs quickly."
Modifying Adjective: "He is very strong."
Modifying Adverb: "He runs quite quickly."

5.2 Types of Adverbs
1. Adverbs of Time: Before, Now, Lately, Daily, Already, Since.
2. Adverbs of Frequency: Often, Always, Once, Seldom, Again.
3. Adverbs of Place: Here, There, Everywhere, In, Out, Away.
4. Adverbs of Manner: Slowly, Bravely, Clearly, Soundly, Hard.
5. Adverbs of Degree: Very, Too, Almost, Fully, Enough, So.
6. Adverbs of Affirmation/Negation: Surely, Certainly, Not.

5.3 Formation of Adverbs
Most adverbs of manner are formed by adding -ly to the Adjective.
Clever -> Cleverly
Wise -> Wisely
Kind -> Kindly
Exception: Some words are the same as Adjectives and Adverbs (e.g., Fast, Hard, High, Early).
Adjective: "A fast car."
Adverb: "He drove fast."
Note: Hardly exists but has a different meaning (scarcely) than Hard (with effort).

5.4 Position of Adverbs
1. Adverbs of Manner: Usually after the verb or object. "He did it well."
2. Adverbs of Frequency: Usually between the subject and the verb. "He often goes there."
3. Enough: Always placed after the word it modifies. "Is the box big enough?" (Not "enough
big").
4. Only: Should be placed immediately before the word it modifies to ensure clarity.
"Only he lent me ten rupees." (No one else did).
"He only lent me ten rupees." (He didn't give it; just lent).
"He lent me only ten rupees." (Not more).

6. The Preposition: The Relationship Bridge
6.1 Definition
A Preposition is a word placed before a Noun or Pronoun to show in what relation the person
or thing denoted by it stands in regard to something else. It governs a noun/pronoun (its object).
"There is a cow in the field."
"He is fond of tea."

6.2 Types of Prepositions
1. Simple Prepositions: At, by, for, from, in, of, off, on, out, through, till, to, up, with.
2. Compound Prepositions: Formed by prefixing a preposition to a noun/adjective/adverb.
About, above, across, along, amidst, among, around, before, behind, below, beneath,
beside, between.
3. Phrase Prepositions: Groups of words functioning as a preposition. According to, in
accordance with, in place of, owing to, with a view to, in spite of.

6.3 Important Distinctions
In vs Into: In implies rest/position inside. Into implies motion towards the inside. "He is in
the room." "He jumped into the pool."
Between vs Among: Between is used for two persons/things. Among is used for more than
two.
Beside vs Besides: Beside means 'by the side of'. Besides means 'in addition to'.

Since vs For: Since is used for a point of time (definite start). For is used for a period of
time (duration). "Since Monday." "For two days."

7. The Conjunction: The Connector
7.1 Definition
A Conjunction is a word used to join words, phrases, or clauses together. Unlike prepositions,
they do not govern an object.
"Ram and Hari are cousins."
"He ran fast, but missed the train."

7.2 Types of Conjunctions
7.2.1 Coordinating Conjunctions

Join together sentences of equal rank.
Cumulative (Add): And, Both...and, As well as, Not only...but also.
Adversative (Contrast): But, Still, Yet, Nevertheless, Whereas.
Disjunctive (Choice): Or, Either...or, Neither...nor, Otherwise, Else.
Illative (Inference): Therefore, For, So, Consequently.
7.2.2 Subordinating Conjunctions
Join a subordinate (dependent) clause to a principal clause.
Time: When, While, Before, After, Until, Since.
Cause/Reason: Because, Since, As.
Purpose: That, Lest, In order that.
Condition: If, Unless, Provided.
Concession: Though, Although, Even if.
Comparison: Than, As...as.

7.3 Correlative Conjunctions
These are used in pairs.
Either... or
Neither... nor
Both... and
Though... yet
Whether... or
Not only... but also
Exam Rule: Balance the structure. The words following the pair must belong to the same part
of speech.
Incorrect: "He not only lost his ticket, but also his luggage."
Correct: "He lost not only his ticket, but also his luggage." (Both followed by nouns).

8. The Interjection: The Exclamation
8.1 Definition

An Interjection is a word which expresses some sudden feeling or emotion. It has no
grammatical relation to the rest of the sentence.

8.2 Types by Emotion
Joy: Hurrah! Ha! ("Hurrah! We have won the game.")
Grief: Alas! Ah! ("Alas! He is dead.")
Surprise: Ha! What! Oh! ("What! Are you here?")
Approval: Bravo! Well done! ("Bravo! A great hit.")
Attention: Listen! Hush! Behold! ("Hush! Don't make a noise.")

8.3 The Same Word as Different Parts of Speech
This is the essence of functional grammar. A word is classified by its function in a specific
context.

About

Adverb

He was walking about.

9. Determiners
9.1 Overview
Determiners are words placed in front of a noun to specify the noun in some way. In modern
grammar, they are often treated as a distinct class, though traditionally grouped with adjectives.

9.2 Types of Determiners
1. Articles: A, An, The.
2. Demonstratives: This, That, These, Those.
3. Possessives: My, Your, His, Her, Its, Our, Their.
4. Quantifiers: Some, Any, Much, Many, Little, Few, All, Both, Either, Neither, Each, Every,
No.

9.3 Usage Nuances

Some vs Any: Some is used in affirmative sentences; Any is used in negative or
interrogative sentences.
"I have some money."
"I do not have any money."
Little vs A Little vs The Little:
Little: Hardly any (Negative). "There is little hope."
A Little: Some (Positive). "There is a little hope."
The Little: Not much, but all there is. "The little information he had was reliable."
Few vs A Few vs The Few:
Same logic as above, but for countable nouns.
Few: Almost none. "Few men are free from faults."
A Few: Some. "A few days rest is needed."

10. Articles
10.1 The Indefinite Article (A, An)
Used before singular countable nouns to indicate a general member of a group.
Choice between A and An: Depends on Sound, not spelling.
A: Used before consonant sounds.
A boy, A horse, A university (Yu-niversity starts with 'y' sound), A one-rupee note
(Wa-n starts with 'w' sound).
An: Used before vowel sounds.
An enemy, An ink-pad, An hour (h is silent), An M.P. (Em-P starts with 'e' sound).

10.2 The Definite Article (The)
Used to point out a particular person or thing.
Usage Rules:

1. When speaking of a particular person/thing already mentioned: "I saw a boy. The boy
was crying."
2. When a singular noun represents a whole class: "The cow is a useful animal."
3. Before names of rivers, seas, oceans, mountain ranges (plural): "The Ganga, The
Himalayas."
4. Before superlatives: "He is the best boy."
5. Before ordinals: "He was the first man to arrive."

10.3 Omission of the Article (Zero Article)
Before proper nouns (usually). "Delhi is the capital of India."
Before abstract nouns used in a general sense. "Honesty is the best policy."
Before material nouns. "Gold is precious."
Before languages. "I learned French." (But: "The French language").

Summary

This chapter has dissected the anatomy of the English language, exploring the eight Parts of
Speech that form the foundation of all communication. We began with Nouns, the naming
words, distinguishing between Proper, Common, Collective, and Abstract types, noting the
importance of capitalization and collective agreement. We then moved to Pronouns, the crucial
substitutes that provide economy to language, emphasizing the case table for personal pronouns.
The Verb, the engine of the sentence, was analyzed in depth, covering Transitive/Intransitive
distinctions, the complexities of Non-Finite verbs (Infinitives, Gerunds, Participles), and the
critical rules of Subject-Verb Agreement.
We explored Adjectives and Adverbs as the modifiers of language, detailing their degrees of
comparison and correct positioning. The chapter provided an exhaustive list of Fixed
Prepositions, a vital resource for MPSC aspirants, and clarified the usage of Conjunctions
and Interjections. Finally, we touched upon Determiners and Articles, specifically the
phonetic rules governing 'A' vs 'An' and the specific utility of 'The'. Mastery of these components
is not just about grammatical correctness; it is about acquiring the precision required for
administrative drafting and effective governance.

CHAPTER-END ASSESSMENT
Multiple Choice Questions
1. Identify the part of speech of the underlined word: 'The up train is late.'
A. Preposition B. Adverb C. Adjective D. Noun

Answer: C — Here, 'up' describes the noun 'train', specifying which train it is.

Short Answer Questions
1. Differentiate between a 'Gerund' and a 'Present Participle' with examples. (5
Marks) Key Points:
Both end in -ing.
Gerund functions as a Noun (Subject/Object). Example: 'Smoking is injurious.'
Present Participle functions as an Adjective or forms continuous tenses. Example: 'I saw a
smoking gun.'
Gerund = Verbal Noun; Participle = Verbal Adjective.
2. Explain the difference between 'Older' and 'Elder' with suitable examples. (5
Marks) Key Points:
Elder/Eldest: Used only for persons, specifically members of the same family. Never
followed by 'than'. Example: 'He is my elder brother.'

Older/Oldest: Used for both persons and things. Followed by 'than'. Example: 'He is
older than I am.' or 'This temple is older than that one.'
3. What are 'Verbs of Incomplete Predication'? Give two examples. (5 Marks) Key
Points:
Intransitive verbs that do not make complete sense on their own.
They require a 'Complement' to complete the predicate.
Example 1: 'The baby looks...' (incomplete) -> 'The baby looks happy.' (happy =
complement).
Example 2: 'He became...' (incomplete) -> 'He became a doctor.' (doctor = complement).
4. Discuss the position of the adverb 'Only' in a sentence and how it affects
meaning. (5 Marks) Key Points:
Rule: 'Only' should be placed immediately before the word it modifies.
Shift in placement changes meaning completely.
Example 1: 'Only I saw him' (No one else saw him).
Example 2: 'I saw only him' (I saw no one else).
Example 3: 'I only saw him' (I didn't speak to him, just saw).
5. Explain the use of the definite article 'The' before Proper Nouns with
exceptions. (5 Marks) Key Points:
General Rule: 'The' is not used before proper nouns (names of people/cities).
Exception 1: Rivers, Seas, Oceans (The Nile, The Arabian Sea).
Exception 2: Mountain ranges (The Himalayas) but not single peaks (Everest).
Exception 3: When a person is compared to a famous figure (He is the Newton of this
age).
Exception 4: Plural names of countries (The USA, The Netherlands).
