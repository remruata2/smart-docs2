                          Parts of Speech


Chapter 4: Parts of Speech

  4.1 Introduction: The Anatomy of Language

The Foundation of Administrative Articulation

Language is the primary tool of administration. For a Civil Servant, words are not merely
vehicles of communication but instruments of policy, governance, and law. Just as a civil
engineer must understand the properties of steel, concrete, and timber before constructing a
bridge, an aspirant must master the properties of words—their Parts of Speech—to construct
robust, unambiguous, and effective sentences. In the context of MPSC and UPSC Mains, where
the precise interpretation of a statute or the nuanced drafting of a diplomatic letter can alter
outcomes, a superficial understanding of grammar is insufficient.


Formal Definition

Parts of Speech (also known as word classes) represent the categorization of words based on
their syntactic functions and morphological behavior within a sentence. In English, there are
historically eight parts of speech: Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Preposition,
Conjunction, and Interjection. Modern linguistics often adds Determiners and
differentiates Articles as a distinct subset.


Real-World Analogy: The Construction Site

Imagine a sentence as a building under construction:

   Nouns are the Bricks and Beams: They are the physical materials—the entities (people,
   places, things) that make up the structure.

   Verbs are the Workforce: They provide the action and energy. Without them, the bricks sit
   idle; nothing happens.
   Adjectives are the Paint and Finish: They describe the bricks (red bricks, sturdy beams),
   adding detail and specificity.

   Adverbs are the Supervisors: They modify how the work is done (working quickly,
   painting carefully).

   Pronouns are the Temporary Substitutes: When a specific worker or material is already
   mentioned, a tag is used to refer back to them without dragging the original item everywhere.

   Prepositions are the Cement and Bolts: They connect the bricks to the beams,
   establishing relationships of position and time.

   Conjunctions are the Joints and Hinges: They connect entire walls or sections of the
   building together.

   Interjections are the Site Noise: The sudden shouts of alarm or surprise that don't
   structurally support the building but convey emotion.




  4.2 The Noun: The Naming Word

1. Concept and Definition

A Noun is a word used to name a person, place, thing, quality, or idea. It functions as the head
of a noun phrase and typically acts as the subject or object of a clause.



   Formal Definition: A noun is a member of a syntactic class that includes words which
   refer to people, places, things, ideas, or concepts, whose members may act as any of the
   following: subjects of the verb, objects of the verb, indirect objects of the verb, or objects
   of a preposition.



2. Classification of Nouns (Detailed Analysis)

A. Proper Noun

Definition: The specific, unique name of a particular person, place, or organization. It always
begins with a capital letter. Examples: Maharashtra, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, The
Constitution of India. Exam Nuance: Generally, articles are not used before proper nouns (The
Mumbai is incorrect). However, exceptions exist when a proper noun is used as a common noun
for comparison.

   Example: "Kalidas is the Shakespeare of India." (Here, 'Shakespeare' represents the class
   of great dramatists).
B. Common Noun

Definition: A name given in common to every person or thing of the same class or kind.
Examples: District, Officer, River, Policy. Analogy: If 'Proper Noun' is a specific brand like
'Samsung', 'Common Noun' is the generic product category 'Smartphone'.


C. Collective Noun

Definition: A name given to a group or collection of similar individuals or things considered as
one complete whole. Examples: Committee, Jury, Fleet, Parliament, Mob. Exam Critical
Rule:

   If the collective noun acts as a single unit, use a Singular Verb.

        The Jury has given its verdict.

   If the members of the group are acting individually or disagreeing, use a Plural Verb.

        The Jury were divided in their opinions.


D. Material Noun

Definition: The name of the matter or substance of which things are made. Examples: Gold,
Iron, Cotton, Water. Grammar Rule: Material nouns are generally uncountable and do not
take articles (A/An) unless specified.

   Incorrect: A gold is precious.
   Correct: Gold is precious.

   Correct (Specific): The gold of Kolar is famous.


E. Abstract Noun

Definition: The name of a quality, action, or state considered apart from the object to which it
belongs. These are intangible. Examples: Integrity, Governance, Poverty, Childhood. Writing
Tip: Administrative essays thrive on abstract nouns. Instead of saying "The officer was honest,"
use "The officer displayed exemplary honesty."


3. Noun: Number (Singular & Plural)

The transition from singular to plural is not always merely adding '-s'. This is a frequent area for
error detection.

Complex Rules:
 1. Latin/Greek Origins:

       Datum ightarrow Data (Note: In modern usage, data is often treated as singular, but in
       strict academic grammar, it is plural).
       Criterion ightarrow Criteria.

       Phenomenon ightarrow Phenomena.
       Radius ightarrow Radii.

 2. Compound Nouns:

       Pluralize the principal word.

       Commander-in-chief ightarrow Commanders-in-chief (Not Commander-in-chiefs).
       Passer-by ightarrow Passers-by.

       Spoonful ightarrow Spoonfuls (Exception: The unit is the measure).

 3. Nouns that look Plural but are Singular:

       News, Politics, Economics, Mathematics, Ethics.
       Example: "Politics is a dirty game."

 4. Nouns that look Singular but are Plural:

       Cattle, Police, Gentry, Peasantry.

       Example: "The police are investigating the case." (Never 'is').


4. Noun: Case

Case indicates the grammatical function of a noun in a sentence.

 1. Nominative Case: Subject of the verb. (The Collector visited the site.)
 2. Objective (Accusative) Case: Object of the verb. (The Minister praised the Collector.)

 3. Possessive (Genitive) Case: Shows ownership. (The Collector's order.)

The Apostrophe Rule:

   Living things: The Governor's speech.
   Non-living things: Use 'of'. The leg of the table (Not The table's leg).

   Exceptions (Personification/Time/Weight): India's heroes, A week's leave, Nature's
   law.


5. Exam Highlights & Pitfalls
Pitfall Alert: Don't confuse Advice (Noun) with Advise (Verb). Or Practice (Noun) with
Practise (Verb).

   "I need your advice." (Noun)
   "Please advise me." (Verb)




  4.3 The Pronoun: The Deputy

1. Definition and Function

A Pronoun is a word used instead of a noun to avoid repetition. In administration, efficiency is
key; pronouns are the linguistic efficiency tools.


2. Types of Pronouns

A. Personal Pronouns

Relate to persons. Divided into First (I, We), Second (You), and Third (He, She, It, They)
persons. The Order of Pronouns (231 Rule): When multiple persons are mentioned in a
positive sentence, the order is Second Person, Third Person, First Person.

   Correct: "You, he, and I have finished the work."

   Incorrect: "I, you, and he have finished the work." Exception (123 Rule): For confessions
   or negative acts, the order is First, Second, Third.

   Correct: "I, you, and he are to blame."


B. Reflexive and Emphatic Pronouns

Forms ending in -self/-selves.

   Reflexive: Action reflects back to the subject. (The officer hurt himself.)

   Emphatic: Used for emphasis. (The officer himself inspected the site.) Exam Rule: A
   reflexive pronoun cannot be the subject of a sentence.
   Incorrect: "Myself is Ramesh."

   Correct: "I am Ramesh."


C. Relative Pronouns

Connect a clause or phrase to a noun or pronoun. Examples: Who, Which, That, Whom, Whose.
Distinction:
   Who: For persons (Subjective). (The man who came here.)
   Whom: For persons (Objective). (The man whom I met.)

   Which: For things/animals. (The file which is missing.)
   That: Can replace Who/Which, especially after superlatives or words like 'all', 'none', 'only'.

        Example: "All that glitters is not gold."


D. Distributive Pronouns

Each, Either, Neither. Grammar Constraint: These are always Singular and take a singular
verb.

   Correct: "Either of the two roads leads to the station."
   Incorrect: "Either of the two roads lead to the station."


3. Subject-Object Confusion

One of the most common errors in MPSC English is the confusion between nominative and
objective forms after the verb 'to be' or comparisons.

   Rule: If the pronoun follows the verb 'to be' (is, am, are, was, were) as a complement, it
   should be in the Nominative case.

        Formal: "It is I." (Not "It is me.")

   Rule: In comparisons using 'than' or 'as'.

        Correct: "He is taller than I." (Implicitly: than I am).

        Informal/Colloquial: "He is taller than me."
        Exam Tip: Stick to the formal usage in MPSC/UPSC.




  4.4 The Verb: The Engine of Action

1. Definition and Significance

A Verb is a word used to say something about some person, place, or thing. It asserts action,
state, or being. It is the most critical part of a sentence; a sentence can exist with just one word if
that word is a verb (e.g., "Stop!"), but it cannot exist without a verb.


2. Classification of Verbs
A. Transitive vs. Intransitive

   Transitive Verbs: Action passes from Subject to Object. Requires an object to complete
   meaning.

       Example: "The Government enacted a law." (Enacted what? A law.)

   Intransitive Verbs: Action stops with the Subject. No object required.

       Example: "The economy collapsed." (Collapsed what? N/A. The action is complete.)


B. Finite vs. Non-Finite Verbs

   Finite Verbs: Change form according to Tense, Number, and Person.

       He goes. They go. He went.

   Non-Finite Verbs: Do not change form. They function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.

     1. Infinitive: (to + verb). To err is human.

     2. Gerund: (verb + ing acting as Noun). Walking is good for health.
     3. Participle: (verb + ing/ed acting as Adjective). A rolling stone; A broken chair.


3. Auxiliary Verbs (Helping Verbs)

A. Primary Auxiliaries

Be, Do, Have. They assist in forming tenses, negatives, and questions.


B. Modal Auxiliaries

Can, Could, May, Might, Shall, Should, Will, Would, Must, Ought to. They express mood or
attitude (ability, permission, possibility, obligation). Administrative Nuance:

   May: Polite, formal, probability. (The meeting may be postponed.)
   Can: Ability or informal permission. (I can draft this.)

   Must: Compulsion/Legal obligation. (Taxes must be paid.)
   Should: Advice/Duty. (Officers should be punctual.)


4. Subject-Verb Agreement (The Concord)

This is the single most tested grammar topic in competitive exams. The verb must agree with the
subject in Number and Person.
Critical Rules:

 1. 'And' Rule: Two subjects joined by 'and' take a plural verb. (Time and tide wait for none.)

       Exception: If they refer to the same idea. (Bread and butter is my favorite breakfast.)

 2. 'With', 'As well as', 'Along with': The verb agrees with the first subject.

       The Prime Minister, along with his cabinet colleagues, is arriving. (Not 'are').

 3. 'Neither-Nor', 'Either-Or': The verb agrees with the nearest subject.

       Neither the extensive training nor the tough exams were able to deter him.
       Neither the exams nor the training was easy.




  4.5 The Adjective: The Decorator

1. Definition

An Adjective is a word used to add something to the meaning of a noun. It qualifies or modifies
the noun.


2. Types of Adjectives

 1. Adjective of Quality: Descriptive. (A transparent policy.)
 2. Adjective of Quantity: How much (Uncountable). (Little, Much, Some.)

 3. Adjective of Number: How many (Countable). (Five, Many, Several.)
 4. Demonstrative Adjective: Points out. (This, That, Such.)

 5. Distributive Adjective: Refers to each one. (Each, Every.)


3. Degrees of Comparison

 1. Positive: Good, Tall.
 2. Comparative: Better, Taller. Used when comparing two.

 3. Superlative: Best, Tallest. Used when comparing more than two.

Crucial Exam Rules:

   Latin Comparatives: Words ending in '-or' (Senior, Junior, Superior, Inferior, Prior) take
   'to' instead of 'than'.
       Incorrect: He is senior than me.
       Correct: He is senior to me.

   Double Comparatives: Never use double comparatives or superlatives.

       Incorrect: More better, Most best.

   Specific Order: When multiple adjectives describe a noun, follow the order: OSASCOMP
   (Opinion, Size, Age, Shape, Color, Origin, Material, Purpose).

       Example: "A beautiful (Opinion) large (Size) old (Age) Indian (Origin) wooden
       (Material) chair."




  4.6 The Adverb: The Modifier

1. Definition

An Adverb is a word that modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. It answers: How?
When? Where? How often? To what extent?


2. Types of Adverbs

 1. Adverb of Time: Now, Then, Yesterday.
 2. Adverb of Frequency: Always, Often, Seldom.

 3. Adverb of Place: Here, There, Everywhere.
 4. Adverb of Manner: Slowly, Efficiently, Bravely.

 5. Adverb of Degree: Very, Quite, Too.


3. Position of Adverbs

The placement of an adverb can change the meaning of a sentence entirely.

   Only he passed the exam. (No one else passed).

   He only passed the exam. (He didn't do anything else, just passed).
   He passed only the exam. (He passed nothing else).

Inversion Rule: When a sentence starts with a negative adverb (Seldom, Never, Hardly,
Scarcely, No sooner), the auxiliary verb comes before the subject.

   Incorrect: Hardly I had reached the station...
   Correct: Hardly had I reached the station when the train left.
   Correct: No sooner did the bell ring than the students ran out.




  4.7 The Preposition: The Bridge

1. Definition

A Preposition is a word placed before a noun or pronoun to show in what relation the person
or thing denoted by it stands in regard to something else. It is the GPS of language.


2. Types

 1. Simple Prepositions: At, by, for, from, in, of, off, on, out, through, till, to, up, with.
 2. Compound Prepositions: Across, along, amongst, between, beside, outside.

 3. Phrasal Prepositions: According to, in spite of, on account of, with regard to.


3. Common Confusions & Fixed Prepositions

This is a rote-learning area essential for marks.

A. Between vs Among

   Between: Used for two persons/things. (Distribute the sweets between Ram and Sham.)

   Among: Used for more than two. (Distribute the sweets among the students.)

B. Beside vs Besides

   Beside: By the side of. (He sat beside me.)
   Besides: In addition to. (* Besides being fined, he was imprisoned.*)

C. In vs Into

   In: Stationary position inside. (He is in the room.)
   Into: Motion towards inside. (He walked into the room.)

D. Fixed Prepositions (Sample List)

   Accused of

   Acquitted of
   Abide by

   Addicted to
   Agree to (a proposal) / Agree with (a person)
   Deal in (goods) / Deal with (a person/matter)

   Prefer to (not than)




  4.8 The Conjunction: The Connector

1. Definition

A Conjunction is a word used to join words, phrases, or clauses.


2. Types

 1. Coordinating Conjunctions: Join elements of equal rank (FANBOYS: For, And, Nor, But,
   Or, Yet, So).
 2. Subordinating Conjunctions: Join a dependent clause to a main clause (Because,
   Although, If, Unless, Since).

 3. Correlative Conjunctions: Used in pairs (Either-or, Neither-nor, Not only-but also).


3. Critical Rules for Parallelism

When using conjunctions, the structures joined must be grammatically parallel.

   Incorrect: He likes swimming and to hike.

   Correct: He likes swimming and hiking.
   Correct: He likes to swim and to hike.

Usage of 'Unless' and 'Until':

   Unless: Condition. (Unless you work hard, you will fail.)

   Until: Time. (Wait until I return.)
   Note: 'Unless' is negative in meaning; do not use 'not' in the clause following unless.

       Incorrect: Unless you do not run...
       Correct: Unless you run...




  4.9 The Interjection: The Emotion

1. Definition
An Interjection is a word which expresses some sudden feeling or emotion. It has no
grammatical connection with the rest of the sentence.


2. Examples

   Joy: Hurrah! Ha! (Hurrah! We have won the election.)

   Grief: Alas! Oh! (Alas! The leader is dead.)
   Surprise: What! Oh! (What! You failed?)

   Approval: Bravo! (Bravo! Well done.)

Exam Note: In Direct/Indirect speech questions, interjections are replaced by phrases
describing the emotion (e.g., "He exclaimed with sorrow that...").



  4.10 Determiners

1. Definition

Determiners are words introduced before nouns to determine or limit the meaning of the nouns.
They signal that a noun is following.


2. Classification

Technically, Articles, Demonstratives, Possessives, and Quantifiers fall under Determiners.

   Demonstratives: This, That, These, Those.
   Possessives: My, Your, His, Her, Its, Our, Their.
   Quantifiers: Some, Any, Much, Many, Little, Few.

Distinction: Determiner vs Adjective

   Most determiners function like adjectives, but they occupy a specific slot (always first in the
   noun phrase). You can say "The big house" (Determiner + Adjective + Noun), but not "Big
   the house".




  4.11 Articles: A Specific Subset of Determiners

1. Types

 1. Indefinite Articles (A, An): Used before singular countable nouns which are non-specific.
 2. Definite Article (The): Used for specific nouns.


2. Rules for 'A' vs 'An'

   It depends on the sound, not the spelling.
   A: Used before consonant sounds. (A boy, A university - 'Yu' sound, A one-rupee coin - 'Wa'
   sound).
   An: Used before vowel sounds. (An egg, An honest man - 'O' sound, silent H, An M.P. - 'Em'
   starts with 'A' sound).


3. Usage of 'The'

   Before unique things: The Sun, The Earth.
   Before superlatives: The best policy.

   Before names of rivers, seas, oceans, mountain ranges (plural), holy books, trains,
   newspapers.

       The Ganga, The Indian Express, The Himalayas.


4. Omission of Article (The Zero Article)

Articles are NOT used:

   Before Proper Nouns (names of people/cities/countries). (India, not The India).

       Exception: The USA, The UK (Descriptive names).

   Before Abstract Nouns in a general sense. (Honesty is the best policy).

   Before Material Nouns. (Gold is yellow).
   Before languages. (English, not The English - The English means English people).




  4.12 Exam Application: Integrated Grammar

The "Spot the Error" Framework

When solving error detection questions in MPSC, scan the sentence in this order:

 1. Verb Check: Is the Subject-Verb agreement correct? Is the tense consistent?
 2. Pronoun Check: Is the antecedent clear? Is the case (nominative/objective) correct?

 3. Preposition Check: Is the fixed preposition correct? (e.g., married to, not married with).
 4. Adjective/Adverb Check: Is the modifier misplaced? Is the degree of comparison valid?
 5. Article Check: Is a necessary article missing or a superfluous one present?




Model Answer Writing: Level Ladder

Concept: The Importance of Prepositions

Level 1: 150-Word Answer (Basic)



   Prepositions are vital connectors in the English language that establish relationships
   between nouns, pronouns, and other elements in a sentence. They indicate spatial
   relationships (in, on, under), temporal relationships (at, during, since), and logical
   connections (because of, despite). Without prepositions, sentences would be disjointed
   lists of words lacking cohesion. For instance, "The book is the table" has no meaning
   until "on" is added. In administrative writing, precise prepositions are crucial to avoid
   ambiguity in legal orders and location descriptions.



Level 2: 250-Word Answer (With Examples)
   Prepositions serve as the "mortar" in the construction of language, binding the "bricks"
   (nouns) and "beams" (verbs) into a coherent structure. Their primary function is to
   delineate the relationship of a noun phrase to the rest of the clause, specifically
   regarding space, time, and abstract logic.

   Types and Usage:

    1. Spatial: "The file is on the desk." (Surface contact)
    2. Temporal: "The meeting is at 10 AM." (Specific point)

    3. Directional: "He walked into the office." (Movement)

   Administrative Relevance: In drafting policy, the distinction between "liable to" and
   "liable for" can change legal responsibility. Similarly, distributing funds "between" two
   districts versus "among" several requires grammatical precision to reflect the intended
   allocation. Common errors, such as using "discuss about" instead of "discuss," must be
   avoided to maintain professional standards. Mastery of fixed prepositions (e.g., comply
   with, adhere to) is non-negotiable for official correspondence.



Level 3: Essay Level (Multi-dimensional Analysis)



   The Role of Precision in Language: A Case Study of Prepositions and
   Connectors

   Introduction: Language is the software of governance. In the machinery of the state,
   where every circular, notification, and judgment acts as a command code, the precision
   of syntax determines the efficacy of execution. Among the parts of speech, prepositions
   and conjunctions—often dismissed as mere function words—hold disproportionate
   power in defining the scope and application of administrative authority.

   The Architecture of Ambiguity: Consider the legal interpretation of a statute
   stating, "The penalty shall apply to factories in the city limits." versus "...factories near
   the city limits." A single preposition shifts the jurisdiction entirely. This necessitates that
   a civil servant possesses not just a vocabulary of nouns (entities) and verbs (actions), but
   a mastery of the relational words that bind them. The ambiguity in international
   treaties often hinges on such particles; for instance, UN Resolution 242's varying
   interpretations concerning "territories" vs "the territories" (an article issue closely
   linked to prepositional phrases) illustrates how grammar shapes geopolitics.

   Structural Integrity in Drafting: Complex administrative sentences often collapse
   under the weight of poor conjunction use. The failure to maintain parallelism (e.g., "The
   objectives are to improve health and reducing poverty") reflects a disorganized mind.
   Correlative conjunctions like "not only... but also" demand a balanced structure to
   convey complex policy dualities effectively. Furthermore, the misuse of connectors can
   lead to logical fallacies in reports. Using "therefore" where no causality exists, or
   "however" where there is no contrast, misleads the decision-maker.

   Conclusion: Ultimately, the study of parts of speech is not a pedantic academic
   exercise but a training in logical rigor. For an administrator, grammar is the first line of
   defense against misinterpretation. Precision in prepositions and clarity in conjunctions
   ensure that the intent of the state is translated flawlessly into the action of the executive.




 CHAPTER-END ASSESSMENT

Multiple Choice Questions

 1. Identify the correct sentence regarding the order of pronouns.

   A. I, you and he have committed a crime. B. You, he and I have done a good job. C. He, I and
   you are friends. D. Both A and B are correct.



       Answer: D — Pronoun order rules: For positive sentences, order is 231 (You, he, I).
       For negative/confessions, order is 123 (I, you, he). Therefore, both A and B follow the
       respective rules.



2. Which of the following sentences uses the collective noun correctly?

   A. The jury has given their verdict. B. The jury were divided in their opinion. C. The team are
   playing well today. D. The parliament have passed the bill.



       Answer: B — When a collective noun acts as a unit, the verb is singular (has given).
       When members act individually (divided), the verb is plural (were divided). Option A
       is incorrect because 'their' (plural) doesn't match 'has' (singular). Option B is correct.



3. Choose the correct preposition: 'The officer is accused _____ bribery.'

   A. with B. for C. of D. in
      Answer: C — The fixed preposition for 'accused' is 'of'. Accused of a crime.



4. Identify the part of speech of the word 'fast' in the sentence: 'He is a fast runner.'

  A. Noun B. Verb C. Adjective D. Adverb



      Answer: C — Here, 'fast' describes the noun 'runner', so it is an Adjective. (In 'He
      runs fast', it would be an Adverb).



5. Select the sentence with the correct use of the article.

  A. The gold is a precious metal. B. Gold is a precious metal. C. A gold is a precious metal. D.
  The gold are precious.



      Answer: B — Material nouns (Gold) do not take an article in a general sense.



6. Which sentence correctly uses the comparative degree?

  A. He is senior than me. B. He is more senior to me. C. He is senior to me. D. He is most
  senior than me.



      Answer: C — Latin comparatives ending in -or (senior, junior) take 'to', not 'than'.
      They do not take 'more'.



7. Identify the error: 'Hardly had I reached the station than the train left.'

  A. Hardly had I B. reached the C. station than D. the train left



      Answer: C — The correlative for 'Hardly/Scarcely' is 'when', not 'than'. 'No sooner'
      takes 'than'. Correct: ...station WHEN the train left.



8. Choose the correct form: 'Unless you _____ hard, you will fail.'

  A. do not work B. will work C. work D. did not work
       Answer: C — 'Unless' is negative by itself. It does not take another negative (do
       not). It introduces a condition, usually in present tense for future result.



 9. Plural of 'Commander-in-chief' is:

   A. Commander-in-chiefs B. Commanders-in-chiefs C. Commanders-in-chief D. Commander-
   ins-chief



       Answer: C — In compound nouns, the principal word is pluralized. Here,
       'Commander' is the principal word.



10. Pick the correct sentence regarding Subject-Verb Agreement.

   A. Bread and butter are my favorite breakfast. B. Bread and butter is my favorite breakfast. C.
   The novelist and poet are dead. D. My friend and guide have come.



   Answer: B — 'Bread and butter' refers to a single idea/dish, so it takes a singular verb
   (is). In option C, if 'The' is used only once, it refers to one person, so 'is dead' would be
   correct.



11. What kind of noun is 'Parliament'?

   A. Proper Noun B. Common Noun C. Collective Noun D. Abstract Noun



   Answer: C — Parliament is a group of members/representatives, hence a Collective
   Noun.



12. Fill in the blank: 'He distributed the money _____ his four sons.'

   A. between B. among C. amongst D. with



   Answer: B — 'Among' is used for more than two. 'Between' is for two.



13. Which of these is a Distributive Pronoun?
   A. Who B. Myself C. Each D. Some



   Answer: C — 'Each', 'Either', 'Neither' are distributive pronouns.



14. Identify the Adverb of Frequency.

   A. Quickly B. Everywhere C. Often D. Very



   Answer: C — 'Often' answers 'how many times?', so it is an adverb of frequency.



15. Select the correct possessive case for 'The house of Jesus'.

   A. Jesus's house B. Jesus' house C. Jesu's house D. Jesus house



   Answer: B — For names ending in 's' (like Jesus, Pythagoras), typically only the
   apostrophe is added (Jesus'), or sometimes 's is acceptable depending on style guide, but
   classical grammar prefers Jesus'. However, if pronunciation adds a syllable, 's is used.
   In standard exams, Jesus' is preferred.



Short Answer Questions

 1. Explain the difference between 'Transitive' and 'Intransitive' verbs with
   examples. (5 Marks) Key Points:

       Transitive verbs require an object to complete meaning.
       Intransitive verbs do not require an object.

       Example Transitive: 'She wrote a letter.'
       Example Intransitive: 'The sun shines.'

2. What is the 'Rule of 231' in Pronouns? When does it change to '123'? (5 Marks)
