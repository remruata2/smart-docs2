## Introduction

The Mizoram Board of School Education (MBSE) has long been committed to providing a
comprehensive education system that caters to the evolving needs of students. It has
continuously strived to align its syllabus with national educational standards, following
the guidelines of the **National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)**.

In line with this objective, the MBSE has undertaken a thorough revision of its **Higher
Secondary School syllabus**, with a focus on **rationalization and optimization**. The revised
syllabus is intended to ensure relevance, coherence, and preparedness for higher education
and future careers.

## Rationalization of the Syllabus

The process of rationalizing the syllabus requires a meticulous evaluation of the existing
content to enhance the learning experience. Recognizing the dynamic nature of education,
MBSE has adopted a forward-looking approach.

One significant aspect of the rationalization process is the **identification and removal of
certain topics and chapters considered redundant**. However, it is important to note that
these removed contents **remain relevant for broader understanding** and are recommended
for independent study by learners.

### Background for Rationalization

The need for syllabus rationalization was initially caused by the unprecedented challenges
posed by the **global COVID-19 pandemic**. Educational institutions worldwide were compelled
to reevaluate pedagogical strategies and curriculum frameworks due to disruptions in regular
academic functioning.

Additionally, the **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020** advocates:
- Experiential learning
- Competency-based education
- Reduced content load with deeper understanding

These reforms necessitated syllabus reduction and restructuring.

## Alignment with Learning Outcomes

In the process of rationalizing the syllabus, MBSE has closely adhered to the **learning
outcomes outlined by NCERT**. These learning outcomes serve as guiding principles,
delineating the knowledge, skills, and competencies students are expected to acquire at
each educational stage.

By aligning its syllabus with these predefined learning outcomes, MBSE ensures:
- Coherence across educational boards
- Consistency in academic standards
- Preparedness for the challenges of the 21st century

## Preparation for Competitive Examinations

While MBSE remains committed to NCERT standards, the Board also acknowledges the
importance of catering to the **future academic and career needs of learners**, particularly
for national-level entrance examinations conducted by the **National Testing Agency (NTA)**,
including:

- NEET
- JEE
- CUET

Consequently, the revised syllabus integrates relevant content from **CBSE and NTA
frameworks**, ensuring students are well-prepared for higher education and competitive
examinations.

> As a result of these considerations, it is possible that the syllabi of a few subjects may
> be **increased rather than reduced**.

## Methodology of Syllabus Rationalization

The rationalization process undertaken by MBSE is characterized by the following key
considerations:

### 1. Overlapping Content
Identification and integration of content that overlaps with similar topics covered in
other subject areas within the same class.

### 2. Vertical and Horizontal Alignment
Inclusion or exclusion of content based on its coverage in:
- Lower classes
- Higher classes
within the same subject domain.

### 3. Difficulty Level
Assessment of the difficulty level of topics to ensure:
- Age appropriateness
- Cognitive readiness of learners

### 4. Accessibility and Self-Learning
Prioritization of content that can be:
- Comprehended with minimal teacher intervention
- Used for self-learning and peer-learning

### 5. Relevance to Present Context
Evaluation of the contextual relevance of content to ensure alignment with:
- Contemporary issues
- Societal needs
