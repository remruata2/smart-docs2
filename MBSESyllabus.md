Introduction

The Mizoram Board of School Education (MBSE) has long been committed to providing a comprehensive education system that caters to the evolving needs of students. It has continuously strived to align its syllabus with national educational standards, following the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) guidelines. In line with this objective, the MBSE has undertaken a thorough revision of its Higher Secondary School syllabus, with a focus on rationalization and optimization.
Rationalization of Syllabus

The process of rationalizing the syllabus requires a meticulous evaluation of the existing content to enhance learning experience. Recognizing the dynamic nature of education, MBSE has adopted a forward-looking approach in this regard. One significant aspect of the rationalization process is the identification and removal of certain topics and chapters that are considered redundant. However, it is imperative to note that these removed contents remain relevant for broader understanding and are recommended for study.
The need for syllabus rationalization was initially caused by the unprecedented challenges posed by the global Covid-19 pandemic. In response to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, educational institutions worldwide have been compelled to reevaluate their pedagogical strategies and curriculum frameworks. The initial rationalization of syllabi was necessitated by the Covid-19 situation. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 also advocates for a shift towards experiential learning and competency-based education, thereby necessitating syllabus reduction.
In the process of rationalizing the syllabus, the MBSE has closely adhered to the learning outcomes outlined by the NCERT. These learning outcomes serve as guiding principles, delineating the knowledge, skills, and competencies, that students are expected to acquire at each educational stage and prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. By aligning its syllabus with these predefined learning outcomes, MBSE ensures coherence and consistency with different educational boards and institutions.
It is noteworthy that while MBSE remains committed to aligning with NCERT standards, the Board also acknowledges the importance of catering to the future needs of learners, particularly in the context of entrance examinations such as those conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), including NEET, JEE, and CUET. Consequently, the revised

syllabus integrates contents from CBSE and NTA syllabi to ensure that students are well- prepared for higher education and career aspirations. As a result of these considerations, it is possible that the syllabi of few subjects may be increased, rather than being reduced.
Methodology of Rationalization

The rationalization process undertaken by MBSE is characterized by the following key considerations:
Overlapping Content: Identification and integration of content that overlaps with similar topics covered in other subject areas within the same class.
Vertical and Horizontal Alignment: Inclusion or exclusion of content based on its coverage in lower or higher classes within the same subject domain.
Difficulty Level: Assessment of the difficulty level of topics to ensure appropriateness for the targeted grade level.
Accessibility and Self-learning: Prioritization of content that can be comprehended and assimilated by students with minimal intervention from teachers, facilitating self-learning and peer-learning opportunities.
Relevance to Present Context: Evaluation of the contextual relevance of content to ensure its alignment with contemporary issues and societal needs.

HISTORY
Objectives:
The effort in these senior secondary classes would be to emphasise to students that history is a critical discipline, a process of enquiry, a way of knowing about the past, rather than just a collection of facts. The syllabus would help them understand the process through which historians write history, by choosing and assembling different types of evidence, and by reading their sources critically. They will appreciate how historians follow the trails that lead to the past, and how historical knowledge develops.
The syllabus would also enable students to relate/compare developments in different situations, analyse connection between similar processes located in different time periods, and discover the relationship between different methods of social enquiry within different social sciences.
The syllabus in Class XI is organised around some major themes in world history. The themes have been selected so as to (i) focus on some important developments in different spheres — political, social, cultural and economic, (ii) study not only the grand narratives of development — urbanisation, industrialisation and modernisation
— but also to know about the processes of displacements and marginalisation. Through the study of these themes students will acquire a sense of the wider historical processes as well as an idea of the specific debates around them.
The treatment of each theme in Class XI would include (a) a broad picture of the theme under discussion, (b) a more detailed focus on one region of study, (c) an introduction to a critical debate associated with the issue.
In Class XII the focus will shift to a detailed study of some themes in Ancient, Medieval and Modern Indian history. The objective would be to study a set of these themes in some detail and depth rather than survey the entire chronological span of Indian history. In this sense the course will build on the knowledge that the students have acquired in the earlier classes.
Each theme in Class XII will also introduce the student to one type of source for the study of history. Through such a study students would begin to see what different types of sources can reveal and what they cannot tell. They would come to know how historians analyse these sources, the problems and difficulties of interpreting each type of source, and the way a larger picture of an event, a historical process, or a historical figure, is built by looking at different types of sources.
Each theme for Class XII will be organised around four subheads:
(a)a detailed overview of the events, issues and processes under discussion,
(b)a summary of the present state of research on the theme,
(c)an account of how knowledge about the theme has been acquired,
(d)an excerpt from a primary source related to the theme, explaining how it has been used by historians.
While the themes in both these classes (XI and XII) are arranged in a broad chronological sequence, there are overlaps between them. This is intended to convey a sense that chronological divides and periodisation do not always operate in a neat fashion.
In the textbooks each theme would be located in a specific time and place, but these discussions would be situated within a wider context by (a) plotting the specific event within time-lines, (b) discussing the particular event or process in relation to developments in other places and other times.
