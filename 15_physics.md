## Objectives

The general objectives of teaching Physics at the Higher Secondary stage are to enable the learners to:

- develop understanding of basic concepts and principles of physics.
- apply scientific knowledge to solve problems related to everyday life.
- develop skills of observation, experimentation, data analysis and interpretation.
- understand the interrelationship between physics and technology.
- appreciate the role of physics in the development of science, society and environment.
- develop scientific temper, logical thinking and analytical ability.
- prepare students for higher studies in science, engineering and technology.
