## Objectives

The general objectives of teaching Biology at the Higher Secondary stage are to enable learners to:

- understand fundamental biological concepts and principles.
- develop scientific skills such as observation, experimentation and analysis.
- appreciate the diversity and unity of life.
- understand the role of biology in medicine, agriculture, environment and biotechnology.
- develop concern for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development.
- prepare students for higher studies in life sciences and allied fields.
