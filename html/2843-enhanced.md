No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/245

Dated: 8th April, 2019.

 Information has been received that a self-appointed ‘Serhmun Relocation Committee’ (SRC), which constituted 10 (ten) members, of Serhmun village under Hachhek Constituency, Mamit District had a meeting on 7.4.2019 @ 8:00 p.m at the residence of Pu H.C. Rokamlova, SRC Secretary and YMA President which was presided over by the SRC Secretary himself, in absence of their VCP and Chair-person, Pi Zohmingthangi, and attended by 12 (twelve) persons. The meeting decided that Serhmun village should boycott the coming MP Election on 11.4.2019 due to the non-payment of relocation fund of Rs. 10 Lakhs to each family of the village (238 households) in connection with the intended relocation of the village following acquisition and demarcation of Serhmun village land into Dampa Tiger Reserve Area. However, they decided not to interfere with the duties of election officials and not to picket their fellow villagers who are still willing to cast their votes.

 The SRC claimed that survey had been completed by DC, Mamit and Forest Department during 2016 and since they had been notified to vacate the village for relocation and that payment of Rs. 10 Lakhs was promised for each family, the villagers had not undertaken any farming or livelihood works in anticipation of the relocation. With no work and non-payment of the fund from the Government, the villagers claimed that they are struggling and faced tremendous hardship with their everyday lives. They also claimed that they are in the dark over their future as there has been no information from the authorities. So, they had to resort to this measure to draw attention to their plight.

 Information also stated that though the Government had urged the villagers not to claim compensation with the payment of relocation fund amounting Rs. 10 Lakhs, the following 11 (eleven) persons had approached the High Court for payment of farm/plantation compensation:

1.  Lalduhawma 2. Lalthlamuana Pautu 3. Lalchhuana

 4. Thanhawla  5.  Lalremruata  6. Lalnunthara

 7. Ngurchuailova 8. Lalngheta  9. Piangliankhuma

 10. Lalramthlira  11. Biakchungnunga.

 In light of the intended boycott, DC, Mamit accompanied by Director, Dampa Tiger Reserve and SDPO, Kawrthah went to Serhmun village and held a meeting with leaders of the village. After deliberate discussion, the villagers agreed and called off the intended boycott of Election after assurance from the officials that they will take necessary action for disbursement of relocation fund before July, 2019.
