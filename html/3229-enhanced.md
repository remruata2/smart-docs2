1. **Mizoram-Tripura Border:**

Mizoram shares 66 (sixty six) kms long inter-state border with the state of Tripura. Phuldungsei village is located near the inter-state border under Mamit District, Mizoram and the same has been claimed by Tripura as under the Kanchanpur sub-division, North Tripura district.

 The standoff between Mizoram and Tripura over Phuldungsei Village in Jampui Hill range started in August 2020 when the Tripura Administration identified 130 (one hundred thirty) residents of Phuldungsei village were registered in Electoral Rolls, Ration Card etc. of both states viz. Mizoram and Tripura. Later, Tripura claimed Phuldungsei and adjoining parts (ThaidawrTlang) are parts of Tripura.

 The tension flared up again after an announcement of SONGRONGMA, a conglomerate of various Bru associations’ intention to construct Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr Tlang during 19 to 20th October, 2020. The same was opposed by Mizo Students’ Union General Headquarters and Mizo Convention, Tripura. Thereafter, DC, Mamit issued ‘Prohibitory Order’ in the village in order to maintain order, which was contested by Tripura on grounds of administrative issues. After holding successful dialogue in connection with the above issues, the intended construction of Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr Tlang and 'Prohibitory Order' issued by DC, Mamit were cancelled.

 The tension flared up again recently when BruSongrongma Mthoh (BSM) submitted a written request to OC, Kanchanpur PS, North Tripura District, Tripura on 7.7.2020 which stated that BruSongrongma Mthoh General Meeting decided to construct Shivraikhung Mandir at Jampui Hill (Thaidawr tlang) on 9.7.2022 in between 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. It also stated that they expected that around 400 to 500 devotees to participate in the said intended activity. In this connection, they sought permission and requested to deploy adequate security personnel.

 Upon learning the above intended construction of Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr Tlang, Mizoram-Tripura border by BruSongrongma Mthoh (BSM), Mizo Convention of Jampui Hill organized an indefinite bandh on 9.7.2022 in order to prevent construction of Shiv Mandir. Tripura Police led by SDPO, Kanchanpur managed to prevent devotees of BruSongrongma Mthoh (BSM) from proceeding towards Thaidawr Tlang, Mizoram-Tripura border and the situation went normal.

Further, Tripura Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. under Tourism Department, Govt. of Tripura has started various infrastructural development projects under Swadesh Darshan-II, Ministry of Tourism, Government of India at Thaidawr Tlang, under Phuldungsei village jurisdiction and its surrounding areas since November, 2021. The infrastructural development work has been executed by Oval Projects Engineering Private Limited, Agartala, Tripura.

Upon learning information about the proposed infrastructural development projects, leaders of Village Council, Phuldungsei, Mamit District intimated the matter to the Deputy Commissioner, Mamit District. However, Tripura Tourism Department has started construction of various infrastructural development projects at the area since November, 2021.

 It may be mentioned that Mizo residents of Phuldungsei and Zampui hill range approached Mizoram State government on several occasions to construct/develop government infrastructures at the area. Input received stated that residents of Phuldungsei village have no intention to oppose the above stated construction of infrastructural development works undertaken by Tripura government as the same will bring benefits to residents of the area and as no action regarding development/construction of developmental works has been initiated by Mizoram government. Leaders of Phuldungsei village expressed their desire for Mizoram government to take initiative for construction of infrastructural development projects. At the same time, they would not oppose any developmental works undertaken at the area by either State as the same would yield benefits to them.

In connection with the above infrastructural development projects undertaken by Tripura Tourism Development Corporation Ltd., 4 (four) leaders of MZP led by Pu Andrew F. Lalramnghaka, Vice President MZP met Pu Lalchamliana, Home Minister at the latter’s Office Chamber on 4.5.2022 and informed their opposition of the reported infrastructural development projects undertaken by Tripura government and the need to develop and strengthen IR personnel posted at the inter-state border.
ZPM General Headquarters submitted a written petition to the Hon'ble Chief Minister of Mizoram yesterday i.e., 20.7.2022, requesting to take steps to prevent any further activities inside Mizoram territory at Thaidawr Tlang, Mamit district by the Tripura government and to take steps to protect the territory of the State. It stated that Tripura government is intending to construct a tower at the said hill and has placed construction materials at the area. It further stated that the move was staunchly opposed by Mizos of Jampui hills (Mizo Convention) and has brought their problems to the notice of the Chief Minister of Mizoram.
