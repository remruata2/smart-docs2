****Investigation Report****

 Accused Lalrinchhana (51) s/o Vanlalliana (L) of Tahan, Myanmar was apprehended by CID(SB) at Dintharkawn, Aizawl on 21.6.2007 while he was on his way, carrying the above listed arms and ammunitions, to delivered them to a buyer.

 Interrogation of the accused revealed that he immigrated to Mizoram in 2003. He was engaged in smuggling of blanket, carpet, inverter, battery, etc. to Mizoram since 1992. In the early 2007, Lalrinchhana came across one-person he knew only as Pu Mawia @ Tluanga of Dinthar Veng, Aizawl. This person wanted to acquire arm either for or for further sell to insurgents in Bangladesh. At the beginning of June 2007, Lalrinchhana met his former associate Suanzapau @ Pauva @ Suana and this person got the arms for sell. On 21.6.2007 Lalrinchhana received a phone call from Tluanga @ Mawia and so he made arrangement for delivery of the arms. Suana handed over the consignment to Lalrinchhana near Millenium Hotel, Zarkawt in a bag, which he took to Dinthar Veng by Taxi for delivery to Mawia @ Tluanga. On alighting from the Taxi at Dinthar he was apprehended by the Police.

 Lalrinchhana had also previously involved in arms dealing but no detail of these dealings is known. He apparently acted as middleman getting a cut in the payment. This time also he intended to sell the consignment for Rs. 1,80,000/- giving Rs. 1,50,000/- to Suana pocketing the rest i.e. Rs. 30,000/- as his commission fee/cut.

 No detail information about Suanzapaua @ Suana @ Pauva or Mawia @ Tluanga is known. So, it cannot be known from where Pauva @ Suana acquired it or its intended destination if Mawia have received it.

**PREVIOUS DEALING OR INVOLVEMENT:**His involvement in arms smuggling case in the past had never been known.
