Subject :  Suspicion Transaction – enquiry thereof.

Sir,

 With reference to the subject indicated above, I beg to draw your kind attention to the DO L/No. G.25014/1/2007-F.APF Dt. 5.12.2008, Finance Commissioner, Govt. of Mizoram requesting various banks of Mizoram to rendered assistance and full co-operation pertaining to the enquiry of suspicious transaction which may occur in various banks of Mizoram. In this connection, intelligence information has been received pertaining to the suspicious transactions relate to the account of Lalthankima Account No. 30431175897 of Saiha District. However, the Branch Manager of Saiha, SBI found it difficult to co-operate with the enquiry officer detailed to do so which came in the way of smooth enquiry of this dubious transaction.

 You are requested to kindly look into the matter and instruct Branch Manager, Saiha to extend full co-operation or to kindly issue us detailed transaction of the said account w.e.f. 27.4.2009 to till date.

Yours faithfully,

****(C. LALDINA**)**
