 Information has been received that CYMA Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting was held today, i.e. 30.1.2019 @ 1:00 p.m at their office which was presided over by Pu Vanlalruata, President and attended by about 40 (forty) members. The meeting, inter alia, resolved to boycott the upcoming General Election of MP (Lok Sabha) 2019 if the authorities make any arrangement for Special Polling Booths at Kanhmun for Bru voters living in Tripura Transit Camps without paying heed to the demand of NGOCC. The NGOCC has earlier expressed their opposition to any arrangement other than making Bru voters cast their votes only at their native villages where they are enrolled in the Electoral Roll.
