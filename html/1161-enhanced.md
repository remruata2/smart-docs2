****WRITE UP ON AGENDA FOR DGPs/IGPs CONFERENCE****

****TO BE HELD ON 21st -23rd, NOVEMBER 2013 AT NEW DELHI****

**1. STATUS OF INTERNAL SECURITY SCENARIO IN MIZORAM.**

The overall security situation in Mizoram state by and large is peaceful. However, communities represented by the Hmar People Convention (Democratic) and Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram representing the Bru communities have been indulging in criminal activities apart from the various militant groups from neighboring states and foreign countries such as Myanmar and Bangladesh are taking advantage of the peaceful status of Mizoram and thereby frequently indulge in subversive activities and pose a threat to the people living in the Inter-State and International border areas. The recent glaring example felt in the Inter-State and International border areas recently was HPC-D, a Manipur based militant group of Hmar community who threatened the electorates of Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) area by way of giving diktat and also the kidnapping of 5 Forest Muster Roll workers and 3 Gautam Construction Company workers at the Indo-Bangla border by Tripura based militant groups, i.e. NLFT &amp; Bru militant group.

 It is often said that the above noted militant groups and other militant outfits of North East are using Mizoram for trafficking of arms and ammunitions. Even though there have been frequent seizures of arms and ammunition in the State, trafficking of arms and other contraband goods have been contained during the last few years.

**2. STRENGTHENING OF COUNTER TERRORISM CAPABILITIES.**

 Even though terrorist activities and immediate threat from terrorism in the case of Mizoram State as on today is found to be almost negligible, owing to the strategic location, there is every possibility that, terrorists may at any point of time take advantage of the situation which would be detrimental to the security of the country in general and the state of Mizoram in particular.

 To assist and strengthen the capabilities of the State Special Branch, Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC) has been functional since 2011. However, the full utilization of information shared through SMAC has often been hindered by the unreliability of BSNL which is the selected network provider. Provision of uninterrupted internet network needs to be addressed urgently by the Home Ministry.

****3. REPATRIATION OF BRU REFUGEES FROM TRIPURA STATE TO MIZORAM.****

 The mass exodus of Bru tribals from Mizoram to Tripura State way back in 1997 has been an ongoing issue for Central Government. Mizoram State has done its best to restore normalcy and is committed to bring back genuine Mizoram Bru tribals from Tripura. Despite sincere and dedicated efforts, however, the reluctance of Bru refugees especially the so-called Mizoram Bru Displaced People's Forum (MBDPF) leaders and uprising of numerous armed groups among the Bru youths has prevented and even derailed the Bru repatriation processes from time to time and as a result of which only a few families of Bru refugees have so far been repatriated and resettled in Mizoram State.

 The latest effort being carried out by Mizoram State to repatriate 700 Bru refugee families was hindered temporarily due to the abduction of 5 Forest MR Workers by Bru armed group supported by NLFT. Nevertheless, the Government of Mizoram is determined to repatriate Bru refugees from six Relief Camps of Tripura to Mizoram and the repatriation process will start from 30th September 2013.

**5. POROUS BORDER AREAS DUE TO ABSENCE OF BORDER FENCING AND ITS RELATED PROBLEMS.**

 Mizoram is having approximately 404 kms and 318 kms porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively which are vulnerable to use by Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs. Besides, the Look East Policy actively pursued by Central and State Government is bound to bring our neighbours, i.e. Myanmar, Bangladesh and other Asian Countries closer to our country in general and Mizoram in particular in all kinds of economic activity. Further, the upcoming Kolodyne Multimodal Project and Highway Project to connect Myanmar from the southern part of Mizoram would widely open trade and commerce activities manifold which would also have the potential to generate criminal activities such as - Arms Smuggling, Drugs Trafficking and International Terrorist Groups to cross over the border. Such activities will need to be effectively countered and neutralized at all costs in the interest of national security as a whole and the North Eastern region in particular. The porous border areas have widely encouraged other criminal activities like abduction of Indian citizens from Bangladesh based insurgent groups and also open for influx of foreign national into Indian States like Mizoram and Tripura.

 It is imperative, therefore, that fencing of all the border areas with Bangladesh and Myanmar needs to be expedited on an urgent basis to prevent unlawful infiltration and cross border criminal activities.

**6. HPC-D PROBLEMS AND ACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT OF MIZORAM.**

 The Hmar Peoples Convention (Democratic) comprising pre-dominantly the Hmar community living in the North Eastern part of Mizoram and Churachandpur District of Manipur has been demanding Autonomous District Council for Hmar community since 20 (twenty) years back and took up arms to wage war against the State of Mizoram. They have killed many innocent civilians and security forces during the past 20 years. Their leaders, Chairman, S/S Army Chief and Dy. Army Chief were arrested by Mizoram Police. The Government of Mizoram has been insisting that, the HPC-D armed group should cease all forms of violence and criminal activities so that it would open the peace process with the HPC-D. Due to the Government initiatives, the HPC-D agreed to the terms of the State Government resulting in the signing of Suspension of Operation agreement in the month of January 2013. Peace talk between State Government officials and HPC-D delegates was held at Tourist Lodge, Chaltlang at Aizawl on 18.7.2013 and 14.8.2013 and the talks ended without decision over the extension of Suspension of Operations (SoO).

**7. RECOVERY OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION IN MIZORAM DURING THE LAST ONE YEAR.**

 Mizoram being located in a strategic point with foreign countries with porous international borders, has been vulnerable to use by many insurgent groups, arms and drugs smugglers to transit their arms and ammunitions and also contraband goods. However, due to the sustained efforts by Mizoram Police, during the last one year as many as 51 sophisticated weapons and about 214 ammunitions were recovered from various arms smugglers and insurgent groups which clearly highlighted the vulnerability of the state as a transit route for arms smuggling. Besides, contraband goods coming from Myanmar side and illegally entering into Mizoram through Myanmar - Mizoram border side has also negatively affected the economic growth of the State. The recent increase in the smuggling of one new type of drugs Pseudoephedrine coming from mainland India into Myanmar side through Mizoram State has called for immediate and proper attention and Mizoram Police has made constant efforts to effect several recoveries.

 The Mizoram has about 405 Kms of porous International Boundary with Myanmar. As per pacts signed by the Government of India and Myanmar, 16 kms to the Boundary of Indo Myanmar are observed as free zone for both countries to have an access. Consequently, illicit drugs are easily smuggled to Mizoram from Myanmar. Further Pharmaceutical Drugs like Parvon, Nitrosen, Pseudoephedrine etc.. are smuggled from Cachar and Hailakandhi District of Assam. A copy of the Drugs route of Indo Myanmar Border along Mizoram is enclosed herewith.
