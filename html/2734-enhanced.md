**STATEMENT OF JACOB HRANGKHAWL:**

My Particular are as mentioned above. I was born on 1st March, 1967 at Rangamura, Tripura and I did my early education at St. Anthony’s School, Shillong, Meghalaya, i.e., High School, PU and BA 2nd Year (History and Pol. Science) and stayed at the School Hostel. I left my education and started doing a job in 7th Days Adventist School in our native place Jaliamura Village as Secretary-cum-Administrator of the institution. Among the five (5) siblings, I am the middle one. I married to Bonny Hrangkhawl (L) and have three (3) children who presently reside at Rangamura, Tripura.

On 1998, a revolutionary movement against Government of Tripura was conducted by NLFT along with NSCN (IM). Exchange of fire took place in many villages including our village in which I was suspected to be involved on the side of NLFT which compelled me to join the organization (NLFT). Other than this, I felt that the native residents of Tripura were being exploited by the Bengali people, and all the riches of the state were being controlled and manipulated by them. By joining NLFT, I felt it is the only way to liberate the native residents of Tripura from the clutches of intruders. Firstly, I was given the rank of S/S warrant during 1998-2001. By financial support from the organization and by using Bangladeshi Passport, I was sent to Philippines for further study of theology in which I received the degree of Master of Divinity. During 15 years of my study in Philippines, I also worked as Christian Missionaries for self support.
When I returned from Philippines I was appointed as unofficial Foreign Secretary of the organization and I attended UN Indigenous Conference at Geneva and New York two (2) times each respectively and I was appointed as NLFT President since 2018 to till date.
