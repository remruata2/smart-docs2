7. Updating of Electoral Rolls for displaced Brus could not carried out by DCs of Mamit, Kolasib and Lunglei due to excessive objection and agitation against Sh.

8. No initiative has been taken for reorganizing resettlement villages, spot identification of resettlement places by MBDPF leaders along with head of families and construction of houses by 2 male members prior to repatriation starts also ignored.

Highlighting the above 10 points which they claimed are yet to be fulfilled, MBDPF asked for extension of Central assistance like free ration, cash dole, etc. beyond 15.1.2019. They also claimed that MBDPF was not consulted about the physical repatriation of 42 families in September, 2018 by neither the Government of Tripura nor Mizoram. They also claimed that casting of votes in Special Polling Booths at Kanhmun in the State Assembly Election, 2018 created lots of hardships and troubles for Brus in Tripura Camps and requested the Union Government to direct the Election Commission of India (ECI) to set up Polling Booths inside Bru relief camps in the coming Parliamentary Election and to conduct the ongoing Special Summary Revision at the 7 (seven) Bru camps in Tripura.

#  It has been reported that 3 (three) leaders of Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples' Forum (MBDPF) namely, A. Sawibunga, President; R. Laldawngliana, Vice President and Bruno Msha, Gen. Secretary held a meeting with Pu Zoramthanga, Hon'ble Chief Minister of Mizoram on 16.1.2019 @ 8:30 a.m at Mizoram House, New Delhi. MBDPF leaders urged the Hon'ble Chief Minister to solve their various problems regarding the repatriation of the Bru refugees. The Hon'ble Chief Minister stated that the State Government would soon convene a meeting with Bru leaders to deliberate the issues of repatriation and rehabilitation of the displaced Brus lodged in the relief camps in Tripura.

# In pursuance of the decision of the meeting of Bru NGOs from the 6 (six) Bru Transit Camps, i.e. Naisingpara, Asapara, Kaiskaupara, Hamsapara, Hazacherra and Khakchangpara in Tripura, at MBDPF Office in Naisingpara Bru Transit Camp on 6.2.2019 @ 12:00 noon, all NGOs of Bru Transit Camps submitted the above mentioned Memorandum to Shri. Rajiv Gauba, Union Home Secretary; Shri. Satyendra Garg, Jt. Secretary (NE), MHA and Justice H.L. Dutta, Chairman, National Human Rights Commission through the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM), Kanchanpur, North Tripura on 07.02.2019.

It may be mentioned that majority of the Brus in the transit camps have been reported to be hugely in favour of returning to Mizoram at the earliest which may have been fuelled by the above problems faced by the Bru residents of the transit camps.
