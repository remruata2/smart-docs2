****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/35

Dated: 16th January, 2019.

Information received indicated that Pu Ianga, S/o Singkili of Tlangnuam Veng, Vairengte had not been allowed to undergo cultivation work at his paddy field at Mautui Zau (agricultural land on Assam-Mizoram border on the eastern side of Vairengte) since 2018 by the residents from Assam side. These habitants had twice destroyed farm sheds constructed by Pu Ianga, S/o Singkili during his absence so as to thwart him from tending the paddy field since April, 2018. On date 10.01.2019, Assam Forest Beat Officer (Hawaithang) and about 5 (five) Policemen from Lailapur Police had allegedly destroyed the under construction farm shed of Pu Ianga and told him to stop tending the paddy field. As the matter being such, on 14.01.2019, Pu Ianga approached and submitted a petition to SDO(C), Vairengte begging assistance from the authorities of the Mizoram Government. SDO(C), Vairengte conveyed the matter to DC, Kolasib and also contacted DFO, Sonai Forest Division to initiate a dialogue. Police party from Vairengte Police Station also visited the paddy field today, i.e. 16.01.2019 to take stock of the situation.

The paddy field had been tended by the family of Pu Ianga since 1972. He also holds Certificate of Agricultural Land Settlement No. VRT/CAD/A-9 of 2009 on the paddy field.

Information received also indicated that Presnagar (Mautui Zau) Karmoyan Cricket Club had in the past approached Hawaithang Assam Forest Beat for conversion of the paddy field owned by Pu Ianga into a play-ground.

 The paddy field owned by Pu Ianga is located at Assam-Mizoram border. It is very likely that the Assam side may gradually continue to disturb other lands within Mautui Zau which were owned by individuals from Mizoram. This initiative is likely seen as an objective of forceful and opportunistic land grabbing for the settlers of the area in the name of infrastructure development and the matter require immediate attention.
