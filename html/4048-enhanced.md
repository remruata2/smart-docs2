****BRIEF REPORT AND PRESENT STATUS OF****

****KALADAN MULTI MODAL TRANSIT TRANSPORT PROJECT ROAD****

****(0/000 – 87/510 KMP, LAWNGTLAI TO R.ZOCHA BORDER)****

****--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------****

**Name of Project****: Construction of a New 2-Lane Highway from Lawngtlai to R.Zocha (Myanmar Border) in Mizoram to support Kaladan Multi Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) Under Phase ‘A’ of SARDP-NE.**

**Length of the Project****:**

**-**99.830 kms as per Original Estimate

 - **87.510**kms **as per Final length.**

_(This shortened in length is because of changes in alignment due to diversion at some locations and diversion of forest land_)

1. **BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PROJECT****:**

 As part of the implementation of India’s LOOK EAST POLICY to establish a close relationship between Government of India and Myanmar which will benefit both the countries economically and culturally. It is an infrastructure development project initiated by Ministry of External Affairs. A Multi Modal Transit Transport Route has been proposed composition of land, river and sea routes through Mizoram State along the Kaladan River up to Myanmar, Sittwe(Akyab) seaport in Bay of Bengal _to connect landlocked Northeast from Kolkata through Sittwe seaport, Myanmar via Kaladan River route._The New 2-Lane Highway takes off from 473.40 kmp of NH-54 within Lawngtlai Town at AOC filling Station.

 The Kaladan Multi Modal Transport Transit Project connecting Myanmar from Mizoram, Lawngtlai is a project that connected the Eastern Indian seaports of Kolkatta with Sittwe seaport in Rakhine State, Myanmar by sea route. In Myanmar, it will then link Sittwe seaport to Paletwa, chin State via the Kaladan River boat route, and then from Paletwa by road to Mizoram state in the Northeast India.

  Originally, the project was schedule to complete by 2014. Due to many unforeseen reasons it is expected to be operational only by the mid of 2021. The project has several sections combining multi-modes of transport wherein 539 km shipping route from seaports of Kolkotta in India to Sittwe seaport in Myanmar via bay of Bengal. This sea route has been operational for many decades, 158 Km river Boat route from Sittwe seaport to Inland Water Transport or Terminal ( IWT) as Paletwa jetty via Kaladan river in Myanmar. Thus, 108 km road route from IWT Palatwa to Indo-Myanmar in Myanmar and 87.18 km route from Indo-Myanmar border at Zorinpui to Aizawl-Siaha National Highway at Lawngtlai in Mizoram in India by road on NH54 which then continues further to Assam via 676 km long. The NH 54 which in turn is part of the larger East-West corridor connecting North East India with the rest of the county.

 

The objectives of constructions of the Project are:

- Provide greater access for North-Eastern region to the mainland, an alternate route to bypass the Siliguri Corridor known as Chicken Neck located near Nepal Border.
- Socio-Economic Development for the North-Eastern States and abroad
- Closer Diplomatic and Economic ties between India and Myanmar and further extends to South Asia countries.
- The project is mainly to facilitate trade and commerce asset between India and S. Asia counties and will serve as most infrastructure developing scheme as sea route transportation cost is the most cheapest and economical in comparisons with air and road transportation cost.
- Convenient connectivity with all sea ports and harbours of India with sittwe.
- **Strategic Importance.**
- Aizawl to Lawngtlai  = 300.00 km

- Lawngtlai to Zorinpui (Mizoram)Land Route = 87.33 km
- Zorinpui Border to Kalewa(Myanmar) Land Route = 40.00 km
- Kalewa to Paletwa (Myanmar) Land Route = 60.00km

- Paletwa to Sittwe(in Myanmar)River Route = 120.00 km
- Sittwe to Kolkata Port(Bay of Bengal)Sea Route = 539.00 km

**Total = 1146.00 km**

**B: LAWNGTLAI TO KOLKATA**

- Lawngtlai to Aizawl  =  300.00 km
- Aizawl to Kolkata via Guwahati = 1589.00 km
- Total = **1889.00 Km**

Difference in Distance (1889-1146)  =  **743.00**kms

1. **COMMENCEMENT OF THE PROJECT:-**Construction of this project was started during October 2010 after call of tender. The project is of 100% central funding through MoRT&amp;H, GoI funding scheme for SARDP -NE. The entire length of road was formulated as 99/830 kms and the whole project is divided into three packages. The first package started from 0/00 and end at 38/00 kmp. Second package stretches is 38/00 – 71/00kmp where the last package is from 71/00-99/830 kmp. First and last package was entrusted to RDS, Project Ltd, New Delhi, where the second package is entrusted with ARSS (Atlanta) (JV), Orissa. However, the overall length was drastically reduced to 87.510 kms due to diversion under Package –II and curve improvement and shortened curve due to extra widening at some certain locations. Therefore, final length of all packages has been reduced by 34.920 km, 25.780 km and 26.810 km totaling 87.510 km.

1. **COMPLETION of the Projects:**- The project was schedule to complete during 2014 as reflected in the original DPR but could be completed during June 2023 due to land issue problems which has been aroused right from the commencement of the project. The project had been revised three times due to omission of essential item of works which was not reflected in the DPR. The omitted items of works were conveniently included in the RCE-I. Again, many essential items of works though proposed and included in RCE-I were dropped on the ground of post verification. The omitted items of works were Construction of Ministry Rest house at Chawnhu, Inspection Bunglow at S.Bungtlang, clearance of mass and heavy landslides at many locations, construction of RCC Side drain to the entire stretches of road. Conversion of Slab culvert into Box culvert, Construction of RCC R/Wall at selected critical portions, critical portions of heavily slides portions, changing of bridge pattern from PSC to Composite steel Girdle, etc.

All works as per Bill of Quantities are completed on June 2023. Meanwhile, due to the dumping of debris by NH 54 Widening contractors, the smooth plying of the road hampered in certain locations. Due to cyclone _Remal_happened on May 2024, road formation at 2 locations were collapsed several locations were fully blocked by landslides and debris and are partially cleared for plying of vehicles. Despite the partial clearance of such landslides, the constant fall of mudslides at certain location can block the road at any time.
