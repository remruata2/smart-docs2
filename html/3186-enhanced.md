**More cases filed against HPC(D) leaders**: HPC(D) leader H. Zosangbera and S/S Dy.Army Chief Biaknunga were granted release on bail by the Chief Judicial Magistrate on 8.1.2013, but the police filed new cases against them and could not be bailed.

 In most of their cases, HPC(D) leaders were granted release on bail by the court, and in the cases which they were not allowed bail, CJM granted them bail on 8.1.2013 but as the Mizoram Police feels it was better not to release them, they filed another case against them to the Court which prevented their release.

 H.Zosangbera was arrested on 17.7.2012 at Delhi Airport and S/S Dy.Army Chief Biaknunga alongwith S/S Army Chief Lalropuia were arrested on 10.6.2012 at Silchar Airport.
