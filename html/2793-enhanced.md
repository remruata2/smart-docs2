During the meeting, discussion was made on a written Memorandum submitted to the Union Home Minister demanding for posting of eligible Mizo Officer as the Chief Secretary of Mizoram and resolved the following:
 (i) To call a Press Conference on 30.5.2022 @ 11:00 a.m. at Aizawl Press Club in connection with the above mentioned Memorandum submitted to the Union Home Minister and to clarify their intended course of action.

 (ii) To resort to indefinite picketing of the Chief Secretary of Mizoram from attending her office w.e.f., 31.5.2022, if no favourable information is received on their standing demand.

 Recapping earlier development, NGO Coordination Committee (NGOCC) held a meeting on 11.5.2022 @ 10:30 a.m. at Central Young Mizo Association (CYMA) Office, Tuikhuahtlang, Aizawl. The meeting resolved to take necessary action for appointment of a Mizo Officer as the Chief Secretary of Mizoram. 

 In pursuance of the above decision of the meeting, leaders of NGOCC met Pu Zoramthanga, Chief Minister of Mizoram at the latter's office chamber the same day and requested him to take necessary action for appointment of suitable Mizo officer as Chief Secretary of Mizoram. In this regard, NGOCC submitted a written memorandum to Union Home Minister, wherein it urged for his intervention for appointment of Chief Secretary of Mizoram within one week i.e., on or before 18.5.2022.
 Input received indicated possibilities of existence of extreme elements and political activists among the NGOCC members and others trying to take advantage of the agitation, and might not hesitate to take extreme measures beyond picketing the office and physically obstruct the Chief Secretary from leaving her residence/bungalow. In this regard, it is felt necessary to take necessary measures to ensure the personal safety of the Chief Secretary. It is suggested that adequate security arrangement may be made at official Bungalow of Chief Secretary and MINECO.
