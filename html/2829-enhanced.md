****LALHMINGTHANGA SANATE'S FACTION OF HPC(D)****

 Hmar Peoples Convention(Democratic) was founded in 1996 with its President as Lalhmingthanga Sanate of Khawlian, Mizoram. However, after 15 years of having various activities, the President himself was impeached on 29th September 2011 by HPC(D) council meeting as he(The President) had made an agreement with Kuki National Organisation(KNO) without the consent of the council members. The council meeting then appointed H.Zosangbera as the Chairman of HPC(D). As a result of this impeachment, HPC(D) became divided into two factions – H.Zosangbera’s faction and Lalhmingthanga Sanate’s faction.

 After he was ousted as President, Lalhmingthanga Sanate, with a handful of his followers continued their low profile activities in and around Assam (Hmarkhawlian) and Manipur (Jeribam) sides, mainly collecting donations by teaming up with members of Jeliang Rong United Front(JRUF), an outfit which was formed by some deserters of NSCN(IM)/NSCN(K).

 From 2012, JC.Hmar, Secretary and Ramchanlova@ RC.Singson, Army Chief, both of Lalhmingthang’s faction started entering Mizoram state and based themselves at Sunhluchhip and Sailutar villages. They began collecting donations from Vairengte and Suangpuilawn areas untill JC.Hmar was arrested by Kolasib District Police and sent to judicial custody. S/S Army Chief, RC.Singson was also arrested along with 5 of his men in Sailutar village on 4.2.2016. They were all later released on bail after which most of them started leading a normal life, even the Army Chief, RC.Singson settled down at Thenzawl, Mizoram with his family.

 As the peace dialogue between Govt. of Mizoram and HPC(D) (Zosangbera faction) began to show signs of positive results, some of Lalhmingthanga Sanate’s trusted cadres – JC.Hmar, Secretary, Laldemlova, Army Chief, Eleazara, Dy.Army Chief along with 9 other cadres changed side by joining Zosangbera’s faction on 1.11.2017. They would eventually come overground along with cadres of H.Zosangbera’s faction at the Arms Carrying Ceremony held at CTI, Sesawng on 13.4.2018.

 Lalhmingthanga Sanate and his cadres, furious at the turn of these events, began to plot ways to take retaliatory measures against this rival faction of theirs. On 27.1.2018, they shot dead Norbar Sanate, Fin. Secretary of Zosangbera’s faction at Hmarkhawlian, Assam.

 After this incident, Sangzuala(Bru) and Rela both a member of Lalhmingthanga’s faction fled to Mizoram and stayed at Phainuam village during March/April 2018. During this period, they continued collecting donation from Teak and Bamboo business dealers who operated along Tuirial river.On 24.4.2018, they left Phainuam and proceeded toward Sartuinek of Vangai range where they were joined by other 6 members. At this time, Sangzuala had promoted himself as S/S Sergeant.

 From early May 2018, these cadres of Lalhmingthanga Sanate’s faction were in an area around Lungthulian village. However, as their presence was known by Assam Rifles of these areas, who keeps on pursuing them, they shifted towards Rovakawt areas.

 On the night of 23.5.2018, Assam Rifles personnel combined with some former cadres of HPC(D), H.Zosangbera’s faction conducted raid against them at their camp in Rovakawt area. They, however managed to evade these raiders thanks to early tip off received from some local civilians. Nevertheless, the Assam Rifles ravaged the camp with all the utensils and bedding left behind by the HPC(D) cadres.

 From this camp, Assam Rifles recovered several important documents including a Letter Head which indicated the demand for Rs. 50,000/- each from every village under Tipaimuk constituency.

 It is evident that the faction of Lalhmingthanga Sanate are badly in need to re-organise their cadre strength alongwith their financial conditions. No activities cannot be made by this faction due to their strength of cadre. However, as long as the armed group of Lalhmingthanga Sanate can move freely between the three sides of Mizoram, Manipur and Assam, they are sure to gain strength by absorbing more volunteers, even the possibilities of joining them by some of the surrendering cadres of H.Zosangbera’s faction cannot be ruled out.

 It is further learn that Lalhmingthanga Sanate is presently staying with his family at Hmarkhawlian due to outbreak of COVID-19.
