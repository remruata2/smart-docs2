No. MSB/CB/SR/2021/863

Dated: 2nd December, 2021

  All Institution CR (Class Representative) Committee (Inside Mizoram &amp; Outside Mizoram) in its Notice issued yesterday, i.e., 1.12.2021, called for a sit-in demonstration in front of the Chief Minister’s Office tomorrow, i.e., 3.12.2021 @10:30 a.m. by observing standing government’s SOP on Covid-19, and it appealed all students who have received and yet to receive their scholarship to participate in the demonstration. The said demonstration was called in protest against alleged inordinate delay and existence of irregularities in disbursement of scholarship to students. It requested the participants to display posters depicting their demand for immediate distribution of all pending scholarship, prompt distribution of scholarship, opposition to a government that does not pay attention to students, etc.

 As per input, around 50 (fifty) students are expected to participate in the said demonstration and if the students’ turn out is higher than expected, they intend to organize simultaneous sit-in demonstration in front of HDFC Bank, Dawrpui, Aizawl.

 It may be mentioned in this connection that MZP and MSU have initially taken up the scholarship issue and students’ scholarship was started to be disbursed w.e.f., 24.11.2021. It was on the afternoon of 28.11.2021 @2:30 p.m. that CR of various educational institutions (both in and outside Mizoram) held Google Meet as scholarship were not credited into the account of a large number of students. Since then, they have pursued the matter and had met officials of Mizoram Scholarship Board (MSB) and HDFC Bank. The above sit-in demonstration was decided through an Online-Poll conducted yesterday due to standing SOP on Covid-19, although majority of the participants were in favor of undertaking procession.

 As per input received from All Institution CR Committee, around 5500 (five thousand five hundred) students have not received their scholarship till date and around 150 (one hundred fifty) scholarship applications were rejected.

 Situation is under close watch.
