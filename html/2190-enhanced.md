 Since the first week of November,2017, staff of CID(SB), Mizoram conducted discreet enquiry to reveal an alleged allegations against some personnel of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement Department regarding production of fake/bogus LSC. As a result of this enquiry, CID(SB) staff seized two Fake/bogus Certificate of Land Settlement Book bearing _LSC No. AZL-2910 of 1990_ and _LSC No. AZL-1439 of 1991_ from the possession of C.Lalkungi (61)@Kungi w/o Tlanghmingthanga of Company Peng, Hunthar Veng, a hawker by profession near Land Revenue &amp; Settlement Department Directorate office. According to her, she had obtained these two fake LSCs from Vaninmawii (36) d/o Zakamlova (L), a Computer Operator at Land Revenue &amp; District Office, Aizawl District. In the aftermath of these seized documents, several staff of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement Department were interrogated which leads to the following revelations-

- The two fake/bogus LSCs were illegally produced by Vaninmawii(36) at the instance and in collusion with C.Sangliani (57)@Sangteii w/o CL Ruala, UDC, Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Aizawl District Office. Vaninmawii had produced these two LSCs from her office personal computer using the saved format. The House site sketches were drawn by R.Lalengmawii, a cartographer of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Aizawl District Office.
- Both the LSCs were priced at Rs. 30,000.00 .While Vaninmawii expected a considerable amount from C.Sangliani@ Sangteii in producing the fake LSCs’, Pi C.Lalkungi@ Kungi too expected certain amount for her role in finding customers in order to dispose these LSCs’.
- The two seized LSCs- _LSC No. AZL 2910 of 1990_ and _LSC No. AZL No.1439 of 1991_ were produced by Vaninmawii without any verification or authentication. No files were initiated in connection to it.
- The two LSCs illegally developed by Vaninmawii were stamped by her with the official round seal of Office of the Deputy Commissioner, DC Revenue Aizawl and the Seal of the Assistant Settlement officer, Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Aizawl district who in turn gave his signature without demanding any connected papers too.

 The interrogations further reveals that many of the staff have been involved so far in the business of selling low cost LSCs demanded by certain customers for availing HBA. Most of them, though, claimed to have sold or commissioned only genuine LSCs checked from the Guard file of the Department.

 List of some Revenue Department Staff who had purportedly sold several LSCs are listed below:

| **S/No** | **Staff** | **Designation** | **Reported LSCs sold** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Vaninmawii | Computer Operator | 20 nos. (approx.) |
| 2 | Vanneihsanga | Revenue Assistant M/R | 10 nos. (approx.) |
| 3 | B.Lalhriatkimi | Revenue Assistant M/R | 10 nos. (approx.) |
| 4 | Vanlalruala | Peon | 15 nos. (approx.) |
| 5 | B. Lalhliappuii | Revenue Assistant | 5 nos. (approx.) |


 Besides, Pi C.Lalkungi a hawker near Revenue Directorate had claimed she has sold around 15-20 LSCs for K.Vanlalzami, Revenue Assistant; Thangseii, Peon; Vaninmawii, Computer Operator; Vanlalruala, Peon, all of them from Land Revenue &amp; Settlement Department. Her role in this illegal business was to search for customers who are seeking such low priced LSCs. They in turn offered her some amount for gratification.

 This preliminary enquiry confirmed that several staff of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement Department has indulged in the business of producing, selling or commissioning low priced LSCs although the authenticity or genuineness of such LSCs could not be verified at the moment. It is suggested that a full fledge investigation be undertaken to crack down such culprits and curb the alleged rampant illegitimate practises on the part of Revenue Department staff.
