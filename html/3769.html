<p style="margin-left:2px; margin-right:-2px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The BNLF was formed in 1996 following violent clashes between ethnic Mizos and Reang tribesmen in the erstwhile Mamit Sub- Division of the state of Mizoram. The immediate cause of the conflict was the demand for an Autonomous District Council (ADC) by a political party called Bru National Union (BNU) which was formed in 1994. The resolution passed by the BNU for creation of separate Autonomous District Council for the Reangs/ Brus reportedly provoked Mizo organisations such as Young Mizo Association and Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) fearing geographical divisions of the State to organise violent attacks in October, 1997 on Reang Settlements. As a result, approximately 32,000 Reangs were displaced and have since been staying in refugee camps in Tripura, Kanchanpur District.</span></span></p>

Later on, they agreed to tone down their demands from ADC and settle for a regional council.</span></span></p>

However, a new group Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM) was again formed recently under the patronage of NLFT. These BDFM cadres are mainly responsible for the heinous crimes which occurred in the western border areas of Mizoram during the recent past which included kidnapping for ransom, burglary of Government offices, etc.</span></span></p>
