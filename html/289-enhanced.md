Sir,

 With reference to a letter on the subject indicated above, I am to state that assessment whether the presence of threat or not on the lives of District &amp; Session Judges as well as Chief Judicial Magistrates had been done. In course of stringent assessment all concerned officials were approached, and examined nature of works assigned to each individuals in consultation with reliable officers who are working at the same office of the incumbent. As a result, most officials claimed to have received malicious threat which may endanger their lives, of course from person suspected to be of close relatives of accused in particular case against whom severe punishment had been imposed. Some reported that location of their residences were also being searched by unknown persons. It is considered the incident was normal in nature.

 Despite of making provision for entitlement of PSO to various categories of Government officials, PSO undoubtedly could be provided to any citizen of India by and large the level of threat perception demands so far. It is revealed from assessment that aberration of mindset of District &amp; Session Judges are need to be redressed by way of withdrawing the existing PSOs of Chief Judicial Magistrate, as it seems that no fresh and subsequent serious threat on their lives have been received at present.

 Submitted for information and necessary action.

Yours faithfully,

**(C.LALDINA)**
