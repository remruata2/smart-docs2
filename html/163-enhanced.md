Subj: Threat perception assessment report.

Ref: No.MSB/CB/B-19(A)/839 dt.4.9.2017

Sir,

 With reference to your order no. mentioned above, threat perception assessment was conducted and the report of this assessment are as under:-

**1. Pu Vanlalenmawia :**

 Pu Vanlalenmawia has been holding the post of Addl.District &amp; Sessions Judge, Aizawl from 23rd January 2015 and prior to this posting, he was Addl.District &amp; Sessions Judge, Lunglei from 27th March 2012.

 During his posting as Addl. District &amp; Sessions Judge both in Aizawl and Lunglei, he has been dealing numerous sensitive crimes which affected not only the victims and accused but also sometimes the community.

 While conducting threat assessment, he was met personally where he explained how sometimes he as an Addl. District &amp; Sessions Judge, had to make Court judgements where accused are convicted to rigorous imprisonment of five years, ten years and in some cases, for life. These, according to him often makes him uncomfortable. Apart from conviction, criminal accused in his Court are often released on bail and even acquitted who are capable of carrying out retaliatory action against him.

 At present, though no imminent threat is perceived against him, considering his nature of work, it may be suggested to provide him with a suitable PSO so that he may discharge his duties with confidence in serving justice.

**2. Pu Lalbiakzama :**

 Pu Lalbiakzama, Addl. District &amp; Sessions Judge, Aizawl had been transferred to Kolasib District. As such, threat assessment in respect of him was conducted by S.O of Kolasib.

Yours faithfully,
