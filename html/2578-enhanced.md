Subject :  Report on Assessment of Security threat perception

Reference :  Letter No. MSB/CB/B-19(A)/907 dated Aizawl the 20th Dec., 2021

Sir,

  With reference to your letter number cited above, assessment of Security threat perception towards Pu Liansangzuala, Presiding Officer, MACT was thoroughly conducted and the findings are as follows.

Through detailed interaction with Pu Liansangzuala, Presiding Officer, MACT , it was found out that he does not have direct or indirect threat or intimidation of any kind from anyone at present and in the past as well. However, he being a Grade - I officer of Mizoram Judicial Service, in his previous posting, many a times, he dealt with various heinous crimes/offences in which he convicted many hardened and hardcore criminals whom he even gave life sentences to many and even though the present posting he hold may not seem precarious, it has to be noted that the aforementioned criminals and their accomplices could seek vengeances to him.

Similarly, any other officers who will be holding the Presiding officer's post in the future will also probably have been involved in the aforesaid serious crimes’ cases in their previous postings just like Pu Liansangzela and possibilities of having serious personal threats will be same as him. It is therefore viewed that provision of Security for Presiding Officer of MACT was obviously necessary for the security of the officer whoever hold the said post.

  Yours faithfully,

Dated, Aizawl, the 23rd December, 2021
