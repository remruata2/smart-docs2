**NOTES FOR REGIONAL MEETING ON DRUG TRAFFICKING AND NATIONAL SECURITY :**

1. **Indo-Myanmar Border Issue:**

 According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of unfenced International border with Myanmar and are around 30 - 40 small villages in Mizoram scatteresside. The Indo-Myanmar borders are guarded by Assam Rifles, who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Due to its long porous international border with Myanmar, influx of foreigners and large scale smuggling of drugs and various contrabands into the state through the porous borders has remained a serious concern for several decades.

 The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar allow Myanmar’s national to enter up to 16 kms into Mizoram Territory without any VISA restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guards Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the Indo-Myanmar.

 Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be of great usefor the government and the border guard alike.

 Having a low profile close ties with ethnic leaders of Chin Hills and Arakan-Rakhine States may also be invaluable for sharing cross-border information.

1. **Myanmarese Refugee Issue**:

 Military takeover took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 whendemocratically electedmembers of Myanmar'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy, were deposed by Myanmar's Military. The Myanmar Military proclaimed a year-longstate of emergencyand declared that power had been vested inCommander-in-Chief of Defence ServicesGeneral Min Aung Hlaing. It declared the results of theNovember 2020 general electionas invalid and intended to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency. In protest against the Military takeover that ousted the country’s democratically elected leaders, thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Myanmar. It is reported that following the Coup thousands of Myanmar nationals have taken shelter to neighboring countries viz. India, Bangladesh and Thailand. Due to close ethnic ties thousands of Myanmar Refugees mostly from Chin state fled to Mizoram and Manipur.

The Chin state of Myanmarsharesa border with six districts of Mizoram viz. Champhai, Lawngtlai, Siaha, Saitual, Hnahthial and Serchhip . Most refugees coming in from Chin are from Lai, Tedim-Zomi, Luse, Hualngo and Natu tribes, which share close links with the Mizos of Mizoram, as well as the Kuki-Zomis of Manipur.

****Information received stated that following the Coup more than 28,562 Myanmar refugees have taken shelter within Mizoram as on 29.9.2022. These refugees are taken care at refugees’ camp set up by NGOs and their relatives in Mizoram. Registration of refugees is being undertaken by Home Department through the respective Deputy Commissioners.

_Suggested Measures to be Taken for Prevention of Illegal Entry of Foreigners of Myanmar into Mizoram_:

1. **Strengthening of Security and Intelligence Network along Mizoram-Myanmar Border**:

 In addition to deployment of Assam Rifles at the international border, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) at various Border Outposts (BOPs) along the border, supplementing the Central Armed Forces.

 Apart from strengthening deployment of Assam Rifles along the border, it is also necessary to set-up new Police Stations/BOPs (with the financial assistance of Central government) along the border areas to act as a second layer behind the Assam Rifles for keeping effective watch on the infiltration of Rohingyas migrants/foreigners and other cross border criminal activities.

1. **Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agencies and Intelligence agencies about Rohingyas Crisis and its security implication, etc.**

 Mizoram Police, Assam Rifles etc. should be sensitized about Rohingyas crisis/crisis in Myanmar so as to enable them to take prompt steps in identifying illegal migrants and to initiate the process of deportation, etc. This could be achieved through Seminar, Workshop, etc.

1. **Detection and proper registration of along Mizoram-Myanmar Border.**

 In order to detect illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram , 3 (three) Special Task Force (STF) had already been set up in three districts of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.

__Similarly, Task Group on Myanmar refugees has been set up in all Districts of Mizoram so as to take necessary action for preparation of registration, necessary assistance etc.

**3. Indo-Bangladesh Border Issue:**

The 319.791 Kms long porous international border between Mizoram (India) and Bangladesh could be a security threat and migration routes for illegal immigrants into Mizoram. **As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division, further infiltration of illegal migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.**

****It is necessary to explore the possibilities to tackle and check on growing influx of illegal migrants from neighboring Bangladesh.

 **(i)Setting up of Border Management Division****:**

Many states in the country are having a separate Border Management Division and considering the strategic location of the state, it is imperative to set up a separate Border Management Division in the State. The state has border with militant infested Countries viz. Bangladesh and Myanmar, and States viz. Manipur, Tripura and Assam and there have been many instances of seizure of Arms, smuggle items viz. Arms, Drugs etc. and report has been received on many occasions regarding use of the state as transit by various militant groups and there have been alleged reported infiltration of illegal Bangladeshi in southern districts of the state. A separate Border Management Division under Home Department/ Police Headquarters should be set up, which will specialize in managing the border.

**(ii) Cross Border Delivery by Pregnant Women**_:_

 There have been reported instances in the southern districts of Mizoram that many pregnant women from Bangladesh enter the state on the pretext of seeking medical assistance and giving birth due to poor medical facilities in their area. As the new born baby has to be registered by the Hospital, they can easily get citizenship status of the country by birth. The matter has to be dealt carefully as it can be security threat for facilitating illegal infiltration and compromise Citizenship status in the Country.

**(iii) Setting Up of Immigration Check Post****:**

 Special attention should be given to districts having international border viz. Mamit District, Champhai District,Lunglei District,Hnahthial, Saitual, Serchhip, Lawngtlai District and Siaha District. The State is conduit for illegal migration due to its long porous international border and ethnicity linked with the bordering countries. The Chakmas/Brus community dominated areas in the southern and western part of the state should be given more focus in respect of illegal infiltration due to its reported abnormal growth rate. Immigration Check Post should be set up in areas which are vulnerable for illegal infiltration. The Immigration Check Post should be set up under the supervision and control of concern District Superintendent of Police. A proper report should be maintained at the Immigration Check Post.

**(iV) Strengthening of Task Force specially constituted to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram &deportation:**

 In order to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram and for their deportation, 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District. These Special Task Forces should be reinforced by making separate budgetary provision, routine meeting etc. for their effective functioning.

**(v) Expedite Border Fencing work:**

The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was 344.41 Km. The border fencing work should be expedited in order to prevent illegal infiltration.

1. **Inter-State Border Issues**:

Border Issues with Assam:

 Assam and Mizoram share 164.6 km inter-state boundary. There have been skirmishes on both sides earlier as both sides claiming portions of land along the boundary as theirs. Residents of Mizoram claimed that 1875 notification should be the boundary between Assam and Mizoram, while Assam claimed 1933 notification as the constitutional boundary between the two states.

 For the people of Mizoram, the only known and accepted boundary between Mizoram and Assam is the Inner Line on the Southern Frontier of the District also known as **The Inner Line of the Lushai Hills, 1875**which was notified****on 20th August, 1875 under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873 as subsequently revised in 1878.

 This is also the boundary recognized by and in actual practice both by the people residing in border areas and even by the Assam Government.

 There are three points which have been regarded as the boundary points between Cachar and Mizo Hills in practice. These are Kukichera on the Dhaleswari river, Duarband on the old Silchar- Aizawl road and Baga Bazar (Banga Bazar) on the present Silchar-Aizawl road (NH-54). Government servants on transit were regarded to have passed the boundary between Cachar District and Mizo Hills at these points (Vide Assam Fundamental Rule 106 read with Subsidiary Rule, 137).

 Therefore, considering all the historical background as well as facts and circumstances of the recent past, it is not possible for the Mizos to accept the imaginary lines, which was drawn without their knowledge or consultation in 1933.

 The three South Assam districts of Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj share border with Mizoram’s Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl districts. Mizoram was part of Assam till 1972, when it became a separate Union Territory. In 1987, it became a full-fledged state. While the two states have sparred over the border in the past, the stand-offs have been relatively non-violent and low-key compared to Assam’s dispute with its other neighbours – Nagaland, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh – on the same matter.

 It is suggested that both states should maintain status quo within the disputed area and any incident which could escalate tension should immediately be settled through dialogue. Concerned DCs and SsP of the bordering districts should conduct routine meeting to review the situation.

 As far as the border issue between Mizoram and Assam state is concern, there has been Ministers level meeting between delegates of Mizoram led by Pu Lalchamliana, Home Minister and Assam led by Pu Atul Bora, Border Protection &amp; Development Minister, Assam was held on 9.8.2022 at Aijal Club, Aizawl. Later, on 21.9.2022, Pu Zoramthanga, Chief Minister of Mizoram and Pu Himanta Biswa Sharma, Chief Minister of Assam held a meeting again to discuss relation of the two states at Assam House, 1 Bordoloi Marg, New Delhi.
