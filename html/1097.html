The Supreme Court of India vide its order dated 22.1.2006 in Writ petition (civil) 310 of 1996 in the matter of Parkas Singh Vs Union of India had issued directives which reads &ldquo;The investigating police shall be separated from the law and order police to ensure speedier investigation, better expertise and improved rapport with the people. It must, however, be ensured that there is full coordination between the two wings. The separation, to start with, may be effected in towns/ urban areas which have a population of ten lakhs or more, and gradually extended to smaller towns/ urban areas also&rdquo;. The apex Court on April 11, 2013 had even issued notice to all states and UTs to appraise it of implementation of its 2006 order on police reforms.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rebeiro Committee (1998), the Padmanabhaiah Committee on Police Reforms, the Malimanth Committe on Reforms of Criminal Justice System (2004)&nbsp; the Police Act Drafting Committee (2006), the National Police Commission and the Law Commission had dealt the subject at great length and expressed views and recommendations in favour of separation of investigation from Law and Order.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been discussions even among higher authorities of Mizoram Police to set up a separate investigation and law and order wing but the scheme is yet to be implemented till today. The delay in the implementation of the Apex Court directives in the State could be attributed to few incidents of Law and Order problems and low crime rate in the state. However, with the increase in the number of population especially at the state capital, Aizawl coupled with advancement in science and technology, Mizoram has undergone massive changes in all aspects of life. And today, the State Capital Aizawl is witnessing various forms of agitations; strike etc. from various quarters on a regular basis. Besides, a number of cases registered at various Police Stations of the State are on the rise which demands better policing. Therefore, it is a high time that the state seriously considers creating a separate investigation and law and order wing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separation of Investigation from Law and Order is desirable in Aizawl City due to the following reasons:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><u><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">To expedite Investigation of Cases</span></span></u><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">: There is so much delay in investigation of cases and sometimes Charge sheet is not submitted to Court within a mandatory period which results in an accused being untimely enlarged on Bail by the Court. One of the main reasons for a delay is that the Investigating Officers are over burdened with Law and Order duties, VIP duties and various other miscellaneous duties that they cannot concentrate on their cases. If they are relieved from such duties they would be able to devote more time on their cases which will result in speedier investigation.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><u><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">To conduct flawless investigation of cases</span></span></u><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">: The Investigating Officers are distracted by Law and Order and other miscellaneous duties which also detract from their efficiency. Investigation of cases especially of heinous crimes requires a high level of concentration on the part of investigating officer to avoid loopholes. Therefore, Investigating Officers should be free from such distractions in order to conduct flawless investigation.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><u><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">To earn convictions in the Court:</span></span></u><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp; Due to their engagement in many other law and order and miscellaneous duties, Investigating Officers could not concentrate on their case which leads to haphazard disposal of cases. Such careless investigation does not stand scrutiny of the court and usually result in acquittal. In order to earn more convictions, Investigating Officers should be relieved from law and order duties.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><u><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">To relieve the burden of Investigating Officer</span></span></u><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">: The 4 (four) Police Stations in Aizawl City namely Aizawl, Bawngkawn, Kulikawn and Vaivakawn PS investigated approximately 1300 to 1500 cases in a year. The total number of Investigating Officers in the four Police Stations is just 50 (Fifty) approximately. So, in an average, each Investigating Officer of the four Police Stations investigates 30 to 35 numbers of cases in a year with an average of 10 number of under investigation cases at a time.&nbsp; Assigning of law and order duties and other miscellaneous duties overburden the Investigating Officer to such an extent that Investigation suffers a major setback.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><u><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">To have a strong team of Investigating Officer:</span></span></u><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Investigation is a difficult task which should be handled by a competent officer. As per the current practice, usually the ability, aptitude and conduct of an officer is not considered before he or she is posted in the Police Station which deals with both Investigation and Law and Order duties. As a result, some investigating officer at the Police Stations does not know the head and tail of investigation while some of them even indulge in indiscipline conducts. Separation of Investigation from law and order will help in bringing efficient officer to the Investigtion Wing to handle cases.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">In line with the directives of the Supreme Court, separation of Investigaton from Law and Order may be effected in the four police Stations within Aizawl City namely Aizawl, Bawngkawn, Kulikawn and Vaivakawn PS which comes under Aizawl District Executive Force (Aizawl DEF). These four Police Stations handle the highest number of criminal cases as well as Law and Order problems in the state. Due to few incidents of Law and Order problems and other crimes, the scheme may not be feasible in other Police Stations of the State as of now.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">It may be pertinent to mention here that Aizawl DEF already has a separate Law and Order and Crime Cell at the office of Superintendent of Police, Aizawl and both the branches are being looked after by Additional Superintendents of Police under the overall control of Superintendent of Police. However, the two branches play only a supervisory role for the whole District Police in the field of Investigation and Law and Order. The Crime Branch manned by a handful of staff, keep a record of all the cases registered within Aizawl District, issue necessary instructions and guidance to Investigating Officers etc. Likewise, the Law and Order Cell has a handful of staffs who plays a coordinators role in the event of Law and Order problems. So, there has been a clearcut lines of demarcation between investigation and Law and Order at the highest office of Aizawl DEF.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Separation of Investigation from Law and Order will entail efficiency in discharge of assigned duties resulting in police professionalism and complainant satisfaction. Scrutiny and Supervision could be more scientific and more technical in their own aspects. However, there can also be some disadvantages in placing the investigation and law and order in watertight compartments. The National Police Commission in its Seventh Report (1981) had rightly expressed its views that if the lines of command and control for law and order and crime investigation wings are totally separate, the contact between these two wings will tend to be practically eliminated resulting in their isolation from each other. Therefore, the two wings at the Police Station level should work in close coordination under Officer-in-Charge of a Police Station. Nevertheless, separation of Investigation from law and order will results in better investigation of criminal cases as an Investigating Officer would be able to give adequate time and attention to their cases which is often neglected at present.</span></span></span></span></p>
