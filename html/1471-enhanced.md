WRITE UP FOR ONLINE/VIRTUAL DIRECTIONAL LEVEL CO-ORDINATION MEETING OF LIA ON 8 SEPTEMBER, 2021

(i)  Security Scenario in Barak Valley (Assam) and Mizoram with special reference to insurgency :

HPC(D) : When a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) way back in 2018, Lalhmingthanga Sanate designated his HPC(D) splinter faction as 'HPC(D) (President's Group)' and did not participated in the said MoS. During that time, his group consisted of around 13 cadres with an estimated 4/5 weapons holding. However, by February 2020, 11(eleven) of his cadres deserted him and joined HPC(D)- General Headquarters Sinlung Group, who are under the leadership of Lalkhama @ LK Hmar.

 It is believed that there are only a cadre or two under the command of Lalhmingthanga Sanate, who himself has a great inclination towards surrendering himself to Government of Mizoram.

 The other Group under Lalkhama, who designated themselves as 'HPC(D) General Headquarters Sinlung' have an estimated 20-30 and are under the command of their self-style Commander-in-chief, Lalkhama @ LK Hmar, whose family are presently residing in Saikot, Churachandpur, Manipur. Their area of operation is in and around Churachanpur town of Manipur.

 After the signing of Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) in 2018,there has been no report of insurgency related violence inside Mizoram which includes the areas bordering Barak valley (Assam).
