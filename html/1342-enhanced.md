 The Bru Refugees repatriation process could not be accelerated as it ought to have been done due to various reasons which among others are :-

i) The Biggest Bru Refugee NGO MBDPF leaders are not much enthusiastics in view of their uncertain future in Mizoram for which they tried their best to slow down repatriation process citing various flimsy grounds and raising endless demands.

ii) The frequent threat and intimidation received by pro-repatriation people from some Bru armed group allegedly insistigated by MBDPF leaders.

iii) Difference of opinion among Bru leaders in the identification/verification of genuine Mizoram Brus and alleged communication gap between Bru leaders and Govt. officials.

iv) A large number of refugees are reportedly unwilling to return to Mizoram and prefer to stay back in Tripura if the cash assistance and free ration for one year is provided in their refugee camp. Some of them even preferred to settle down either in Assam or Tripura instead of returning to Mizoram.

 Nevertheless, some section of Refugees in different refugee camps are eagerly awaiting their turn and they openly accused their MBDPF leaders of blocking smooth repatriation process and asked for early repatriation.

v) Shortage of manpower in the Mamit Dist. administration is also cited as one of the reasons in the slow process of repatriation.

 Following are detailed official records of refugees repatriated since 2/11/2011 till date.
