**New initiative/Development****:**

To cover the whole of Mizoram, CID(SB) is currently having 16 outpost under the command of their respective sector officer. These sectors cover all the district headquarters, bordering towns/villages and sensitive areas. In-service training programmes are being made with respect of Sector Officers and staff of outposts to be conducted at regular interval. Also besides normal routine works, Field Staff in Aizawl as well as Outposts are being beefed up to give extra effort operation.

It has been observed that the majority of these outpost lack proper residential quarters/office and have to be content with renting civilian houses. If proper arrangement could be made for provision of quarters/office to them, it would be a great improvement. Besides, it would be extra helpful for accommodating senior officers visiting the various outposts from CID(SB) headquarters.
