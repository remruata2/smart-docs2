****REVIEW ON NON-BANKING FINANCIAL COMPANIES, UNINCORPORATED BODIES AND OTHER ILLEGAL ELEMENTS****

An attractive offer to attain overnight riches beautifully coined as CHIAHPUAM or KARKHAT BANK or FACELESS BANK prevailed upon a large number of people within Aizawl City and other parts of the State since the middle parts of 2007. The offer was so attractive that even educated as well as big business men and women, Govt. Officials and politicians could not resist the temptation and invested huge amount of money ignoring the possible risk factors that could be felt right from its initial stage had they be more inquisitive about the legality and transaction of that business.

The modus operandi of this faceless bank depends largely on mutual trust between the Depositors and the so called Collectors. The collectors at the bottom line collected money from the prospective depositors / investors offering certain attractive interest which was submitted to his / her immediate upline, which in turn again submitted to the next upline slicing out some interest portion for him / her. The chain goes on upto the topmost collector who convinced his / her immediate downline that the money has been invested to the Stock Exchange or Black Market business.

When the Mizoram Police’s attention was drawn by this dubious / fictitious kind of shady business, crores of rupees had already been circulated amongst Depositors / collectors. When the Police unearthed this shady business, majority of the depositors instead of thanking the Police pointed an accusing fingers on the Police thinking that the Police action hindered their claimed smooth flow of good business. While enquiry was going on no depositors or the then investors voluntarily came out to help and inform the Police and rather concealed their business and honestly kept their secret code. Nevertheless, the truth came out and they came to know the stock exchange investment was just an illusion and even getting their deposited money back became a distant dream.

Complaints, FIRs and numerious endless meeting with their so called collectors and even report of kidnapping of the suspected hoarders of their deposited money on various occasions was received. The Govt. formed Special Investigation Team under the command of IGP Mizoram. The notification was issued on 16.1.2009. The SIT team swing into action and worked day and night.

**NBFCs and UIBs**:

While the so-called CHIAHPUAM Investigation was about to complete a new kind of business resurfaced at Aizawl since January 2009. CID (SB) Unit, sensing the possible flow of cash and awakened by CHIAHPUAM crisis acted swiftly as a result of which numerous suspicious non-banking financial companies had been detected in the month of January, 2009. As many as 30 non-banking financial companies and unincorporated bodies had been established and in operational as financial Institution in contravention with Chapter III C Rule No. 45S of Reserve Bank of India Act (Act 2 of 1934) in Mizoram, most of them at Aizawl since 1996 till date. Majority of these companies are sponsored by persons from Assam and Kolkata and many Burmese nationals permanently settled in Mizoram and Manipuries are also involved in this operation. Lists of NBFCs and UIBs are tabled and attached in a separate sheet .

Though some of the Companies claimed to have registration under SEBI and IRDA none of them have been registered under RBI.

**MODUS OPERANDI**: These firms/Companies are advertising themselves to the public as being legal financial institutions and lured them in the form of engaging agents to deposit money with fat interest ranging from three percent (3%) to thirty five percent (35%).

**MONEY INVOLVED**: The amount of money deposited by the customers which these companies are unable to repay is about Rs. 3067.4 lakhs.

****CURRENT STATUS**: More than half of these companies (in bold in the list) ceased to operate at present. No complaint has yet been received by Police against these companies till date. The reason behind the non receipt of FIR or complaint seemed to be the hope of re-claiming their deposited sum from the so-called companies. Investigation revealed that the depositors /investors had repeated meeting and formed an association to claim back their money. They even planned to sue the companies to reclaim their money.**

**REGULATION AND LEGAL ASPECTS**:

The non-Banking Financial Companies being operational in Mizoram State and elsewhere needs to be regulated with proper guidelines and restriction outlined by Reserve Bank of India. However, most of the said companies / institutions being operational in Mizoram could hardly be treated as non-banking Financial Companies but rather be treated as unincorporated financial institutions. The CID (SB) of Mizoram had conducted enquiry against such institutions since 2008 and some new companies also came up during this period. While the investigating agency are conducting enquiry against such companies and updated report submitted to the authority time to time. New companies with more attractive offer came into existence and customers did not stop joining the said companies, perhaps due to the lack of proper regulation / restrictions imposed upon them by competent authorities either RBI or concerned Department Such as Finance of both Central and State Govt.

Most of the enquiry report submitted are based on interview with the customers and concerned institutions and also from other sources. Not a single complaint in the form of FIR or otherwise had so far been received from the so-called victim’s and most of the customers / victims interviewed clearly revealed that they are reluctant to approach Hon’ble Court or the law enforcing agency but rather tried their best to reclaim their invested money. The concerned agency could not do much except collection of data and the suspected transaction in all these companies secretly continued under the very nose of law enforcing agency. The Mizoram Protection of Interest Depositors (in Financial Establishment) Acts 2003 being enforced in Mizoram seemed insufficient to prosecute the alleged defaulters (a copy enclosed).

In view of the above, concerned Department i.e. Finance Department in consultation with RBI and Law Department should chalk out guidelines / regulations to restrict such suspected illegal transaction of business in Mizoram.

List of suspected / fictitious Financial Institutions based on enquiry report of SP, CID (SB) are attached for further perusal.
