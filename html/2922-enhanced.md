****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/104

Dated: 15th February, 2019.

There has been report of uneasy tension at Bairabi (Zophai) area following hassles between Mizo landowners and Bengali tenant farmers over non-payment of rents during recent harvest period. Mizo landowners have alleged that Assam Police of Ramnathpur BOP and Forest officials of Assam had interfered by inducing the tenant farmers not to pay rent to the Mizo landowners. The near recurrence of Law &amp; Order situation, however, was averted as Police team led by SDPO, Kolasib managed to control the angry landowners on 09.02.2019.

It has been the usual practice that the Bengali tenant farmers used to pay the rents in cash in lieu of crop harvested as agreed between themselves but for the alleged interference of Assam Police.

The Bengali tenants had shifted from their paddy field huts to a location beyond IR (Zophai) Outpost in an area closer to the Assam IR Police Outpost, within the Inner Line Reserve, in 8 (eight) newly constructed huts, allegedly at the behest of Assam Police, who obviously anticipated possible reaction from the Mizos. According to information received, another 3 (three) huts are now under construction.

It is learnt that the Bengali tenants were ready to pay the rents as usual but were intimidated not to do so by the Assam Police.

Village Council of Bairabi decided to await the Government's intervention as they expect to solve the issue amicably.

1. H. Lalnghaka, Baktawng
