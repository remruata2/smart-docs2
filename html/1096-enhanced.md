****STUDENTS OF NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (NIT), MIZORAM****

 On 1st April, 2018, around 50 students of National Institute of Technology (NIT) tried to meet Governor of Nizoram, Lt. Nirbhay Sharma at Raj Bhavan over the death of one of the students, allegedly due to ‘unhygienic’ food and water provided in the NIT hostel, Tanhril. But, the Governor was unavailable; Students of NIT organised a sit-in demonstration in front of Raj Bhavan North Gate on this day.

 Students continued a sit-in demonstration in front of the NIT Office at Chaltlang on 2.4.2018 till 4.4.2018 demanding the intervention of Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to resolve the issue.

 The students of NIT have also submitted a memorandum to the Hon’ble Governor of Mizoram, Hon’ble Chief Minister, the Chief Secretary, Mizoram and Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) on 1st April, 2018 requesting them to take steps towards improving the NIT administration and also to take necessary action against the erring officials.

 Devsharan Kumar who was in the first year of Bachelor’s degree in technology (B.Tech.) died on 31st March, 2018 at Guwahati. The student alleged that he had fallen ill due to the bad quality of food and water that was provided in the Institution’s Hostel. Devsharan Kumar initially complained of a throat infection but when his symptoms got worse, he was allowed to leave but was immediately admitted to a hospital in Guwahati on his way home. While doctors were unsure as to what caused the symptoms, they admitted him to the ICU where he was said to have had heart infection.

 Student claimed that they had previously informed college authorities about the absence of any proper food facility in the hostel premises six months ago. They alleged that despite their complaints, the authorities took no such measures to change the status quo.

 The student further added that Kumar had requested the hostel warden, Ajmal Koya, for medical leave as he did not feel well enough to attend his mid-semester examinations but the warden allegedly neither analysed his condition nor gave him permission to return home.

 The students said that a prestigious government funded Institution that charges around Rs. 2 laks per student out of which Rs. 36,000/- is kept aside for food, should provide proper food and adequate amenities to its student.
