****(b)****Efficient Consequence management- The Coordinating mechanism at State-level that presently exists could be outlined and suggestions to improve the system may be made.****

**(a)Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA) Coordination/ Directional Meeting:**

Assam Rifle and Border Security Force (BSF) have regularly conducted LIA Coordination Meeting in Aizawl. LIA Directional Meeting is also regularly conducted by BSF in Silchar, Assam. Officers from State Police, Security forces, paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies deployed within the state of Mizoram and Assam have attended such meetings.

**(a)Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC**):

(i)Mizoram Police have operationalised a Subsidiary Multi-Agency Centre (SMAC) since May, 2011. Regular SMAC meetings of Nodal Officers of the State police, security forces, paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies deployed within the State of Mizoram are being conducted regularly at SIB Hqrs, Aizawl.

(ii)Intelligence inputs are being shared with various intelligence agencies all over India through MAC Threat Management System.

**Suggestion to improve the System of SMAC in Mizoram:**

Real times sharing of intelligence inputs through Threat Management System (TMS) with other intelligence agencies are hampered due to frequent disruption of connectivity (internet) of the system. It is therefore suggested that suitable measure may be taken to plug such loophole.
