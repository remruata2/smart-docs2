Sir,

 In pursuance of the above mention reference order No. and subject, assessment was conducted and the findings of my report are as under-

Pu K.L.Liana : Pu K.L.Liana is a prominent and popular judge of Mizoram Judicial Service, who is known for his fairness. At the moment, no immediate threat is known to exist against him in connection with his position as a Judge, Special Court, ND &amp; PS Act/Presiding Officer MACT. So far, he had not received any threat from his convicted persons or their families. He strongly believed that nobody will have a desire to take revenge against him because of his judgements. As such, he deems having a PSO unnecessary.

Pu Vanlalmawia : Pu Vanlalmawia, the present Addl. District and Session Judge, Aizawl could not mentioned receiving any threatening remarks verbally, written or through telephone as a result of the many cases trail in his Court. According to him, he does not require any PSO at the moment. He however suggested having access to security personnel whenever the need may arise.

Pu Lalbiakzama : Pu Lalbiakzama, being an Addl. District and Session Judge of Aizawl, have been dealing various serious cases in his Court. Although he sometime felt uncomfortable, no threat has been received by him as a result of his judgements. He also claimed that he does not require any PSO.

Conclusion : No immediate threat are found to exist on the securities of the three judges mentioned above. Interaction with each person was also conducted in this regards. None of them could mention receiving any threat- verbally or in writings in connection with their position as a Judge. Considering the present situation, no PSO’s are required by any of them at the moment.
