Dated: 19th March, 2019.

Information received indicated that today, i.e. 19.3.2019 @ 7:00 a.m, a Joint Meeting of Village Councils, YMA, MHIP, MUP, MZP Sub-Hqrs. and MSU Sub-Hqrs. within Bairabi was held at Bairabi North YMA Hall which was attended by 36 (thirty six) members. The meeting discussed about the intended construction of the so called “Zofate Chawlhbuk” at Zophai, Bairabi area by MZP Gen. Hqrs., Aizawl. After due deliberation, the meeting adopted a resolution which is inconsistent with the proposed construction of “Zofate Chawlhbuk” within Bairabi area by MZP as they have experienced serious problems in the past and expressed their support on steps taken to resolve the boundary dispute between the states of Mizoram-Assam in peaceful manner. The meeting further urged the Government of Mizoram to take immediate steps to solve the issue.

Information received further indicated that Office Bearers and some members from MZP Gen. Hqrs. are intending to visit Bairabi on 22.3.2019 to hold a meeting with the NGOs of Bairabi.
