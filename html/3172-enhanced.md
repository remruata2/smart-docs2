 The two women were already suspected and were taken into police custody for interrogation. Besides burning vehicles and a house on 29th Jan., the women confessed that they burnt several bikes at different localities of Aizawl on 21st Jan. said the police.

 The motive behind the crime was not that of anger or revenge said the accused, they said it was done out of drunken excitement. The women found kerosene in a place where pigs feed were cooked, took the kerosene and started to burn whatever they want as they roamed around. Police would not give proper reply to the media about the crime or the culprits.

 In the meanwhile, some locals of Bethlehem Veng expressed their disbelief that only two women could not be responsible for burning those numbers of vehicles and a house, they believed more people could be involved.

 Meeting between Local Council and Branch YMA of Bethlehem Veng and Bethlehem Vengthlang was held immediately to prevent an outbreak of public anger and the residences of the accused were guarded by some people. Many youth of Bethlehem Veng gathered at Sihlui and they were prevented from proceeding to Aizawl PS by local leaders. Local leaders were working hard to keep peace and were able to prevent local people from proceeding to Aizawl PS.

 Several personnel from 1st Bn. MAP were on duty at Aizawl PS and did their best and prevent angry people from doing harmful things. Police are also ready for security measures.
