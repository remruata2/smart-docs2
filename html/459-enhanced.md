**_ENQUIRY REPORT ON LETTER SENT TO THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA_**

_BY HMINGA PA SUBMITTED BY SI JH CHUNGLIANTHANGA_

 The signatory of the letter to the President of India written under the pseudonym Hminga Pa is the same person as Pu V.Lalfakzuala of Government Complex, Aizawl. He got the pet name Hminga Pa after his son V.Hmingthanmawia, 12 years of age. V.Lalfakzuala has mental problem and often consulted psychiatrist. The letter he sent to the President seemed to be written while he was admitted to the Synod Hospital, Durtlang due to his psychological problem, he was delusional and it seemed that he wrote what was in his imagination.

 Pu V. Lalfakzuala @ Pu Faka was Sub-Inspector of Police at 3rd IR Bn. but he had to leave his job in 2015 in Voluntary retirement due to his psychological problem. Pu Faka also wrote that his wife Pi Lalrohlui, mother of his 6 (six) children was involved in debauchery/promiscuity with their neighbour, Marama, a Taxi driver. He wrote that he was informed about his wife's unfaithfulness by God on 12th May, 2015 while he was at home. That accusation was baseless. He was annoyed at the Church, community and all his relatives for not believing in his wife's unfaithfulness. His wife did not dare to stay with him for his delusional mental state and left/divorced him.

 The 2 (two) nurses, Louise and Elizabeth whom Pu Faka accused of having sexual intercourse with senior male nurse, Mr. John on 9.3.2017 and 6.5.2017 were not on duty on the mentioned dates. Moreover, Pu Faka himself was not even admitted to the Hospital on these days. In fact, he was admitted in the Hospital on 23-25.12.2010; 17-24.8.2016, 29.7.2016 and 13.8.2016. He was not admitted in PC Synod Hospital in the year 2017 at all and that was the year in which he claimed the incident existed. The persons he accused did tend to him while he stayed in the hospital because it was their duty, Pu Faka flirted with them and sent them love letters but they paid no heed to their patient who was their senior in age (49 yrs. of age) and they just put him in their strides. The fact that Pu Faka still said Louise and Elizabeth love him proves that he is mentally unstable and delusional.

 Pu Faka also accused Te-i and Esther-i of having sex with Mr John on 6.8.2017 and 7.8.2017. That also seemed to be just his imagination because there is no Mr. John, and no John exists among the senior male nurse. The only male whose name is close to John was Joseph Lalnunmawia (30) s/o Lalromawia of Ramhlun Vengthar who was with a patient at the time of when Pu Faka was hospitalized. All the names of the nurses mentioned by Pu Faka are all General Nurses and Midwifery Trainees at Synod Hospital and not nurses as he thought them to be their names and addresses as under :-

(1) Louise : Loisy Lalchhandami (21)

  D/o C.Laldika, GNM – 3rd Yr.,

  Leitan, Durtlang, Ph. 8794118711

(2) Elizabeth : Elizabeth Remsangzuali (22)

  D/o Lalrinliana, GNM – 3rd Yr.,

  Chanmari West, Ph. 7642917033

(3) Tete-i : Lalthlamuanpuii (23)

  D/o C.Lalmuanga, GNM – 2nd Yr.,

  Keifang

(4) Te-i : H.Lalhmachhuani (19)

  D/o H.Lalnunsangi, GNM – 3rd Yr.,

  Kawlkulh

(5) Esther : Esther Vanlalrinzuali (21)

  D/o Vanlalsiama, GNM – 3rd Yr.,

  Sairang, Sihhmui

(6) Ruth : Ruth MS Dawngkimi (23)

  D/o Vanlalsangkunga, GNM – 2nd Yr.,

  Sairang, Ph. 8794761520

 All the names mentioned by Pu Faka were on duty from 29th July - 13th August, 2016 at the Male Medical Ward fulfilling to their duty deployment. And they also tend to In-Patient (IP) No. 5240 Pu V.Lalfakzuala @ Pu Faka. Pu Faka sent love letters to all of them and told each one of them he loved them. He said that he needed a wife for his wife had left him and told some of them that he would take them to South Korea for Honeymoon. No one took him seriously; in fact they were scared of him. During his 16 (sixteen) days stay in the hospital, he flirted with each one of the nurses and they were all annoyed with him for his behaviour. They are all embarrassed and felt sorry that he defamed them like this and wanted to take action against him and the only thing that stopped them are the fact that he is mentally unstable.

 As such is the complicated case, and to prove that the content of the letter sent to the President of India is baseless and also to prove that this is done by a person with mental problem, the case can be summed up as follows :-

(1) The letter would have been sent to the concerned Police Station or concerned authority if he was mentally stable. From the specimen handwriting of Pu Faka, the letter is proved to be hand written by Pu Faka.

(2) Regarding his accusation of his wife's unfaithfulness – he said God informed him but there is no evidence or witness to this. His congregation, community and relatives could not accept this.

(3) Pu Faka was disturbed by strange noises and demons and was treated by Psychiatrist, Dr C.Lalhrekima, MD, Civil Hospital, Aizawl on 25.8.2015. His father Pu V.Lalsiama said that his son Pu Faka could not return to his normal self till now.

(4) He was not even in the hospital on the dates 9.3.2017 &amp; 6.5.2017, he said that Louise and Elizabeth had sex with senior male nurse Mr. John.

(5) Mr. John does not exist at all among the male nurses and Louise and Elizabeth have never heard of him.

(6) The male nurse who can be traced close to the name of Mr. John was Johny Laltanpuia, 4th Year GNM trainee, who died of acute liver failure on 26.4.2017. Pu Faka accused Te-I and Esther-I of having sex with Mr. John on 6-7.8.2017, this proved that he just fabricated the whole story.

(7) Pu V.Lalsiamliana, father of Pu Faka and his daughter V.Lalsangluaii of Govt. Complex said that they don’t know how to handle and take care of the mentally disturbed Pu Faka and how troublesome and hard it is for the family, he does not allow his 5 (five) children to attend school, they also said that the Church and community are aware of Pu Faka’s mental problem.

(8) Pu Faka claimed till today that hospital nurses liked and loved him and that they wanted to marry him, the nurses found this was strange and is aggravated and wanted to take action against him for wrongly accusing them with baseless false/fabricated stories.

 All these points proved that Pu V.Lalfakzuala @ Pu Faka @ Hminga Pa’s letter to the President of India was just basesless and fabricated which in turn was hurtful and embarrassing for his accused. It was done by a mentally unstable yet clever person.
