**Sir,**

****With reference to the subject and no. cited above, I am furnishing the required information as under.****

**On the night of 18.10.2011@ 7:00-8:00pm, one Beloram@ Sadoni Pa (50) of Medili village, Assam (not Miloram as published in Evening Post daily newspaper dt. 21.10.2011) was assaulted to death by binding his arms and legs and then chopped off his head by S/S L/Cpl. Muilau and his party of the so-called NLF/BRA/BLA(not BNLF) at Medili village. They left a note stating S/S Lt. Bisoram Reang@Bidii Pa@Bura, S/o Jagadis of Medili village, Karimganj, Assam who surrendered to SP, Mamit on 26.8.2011 was the main target. Since Bisoram Reang@Bidii Pa was not available in Medili village, his close relative Beloram@Sadoni Pa was killed as an act of revenge. The party who had committed the brutal murder also warned the on-lookers not to disclose the matter to police otherwise they would meet the same fate. They also stated that they would remain in and around Medili village to kill more people.**
