**FMR New Guidelines (Free Movement Limit On Indo-Myanmar Border Tightened To 10 Km, With Border Pass)**_:_

The Indian government has implemented new measures to regulate movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following a directive from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). On 24thDecember 2024, the MHA announced a new protocol that reduced the free movement regime (FMR) range from 16 km to 10 km. Although Union Home Minister Amit Shah had previously announced in February last year that the FMR would be scrapped, an official notification has yet to be issued.

Security along the 510-km border has been strengthened, and residents living within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border are now required to obtain a Border Pass for travel. The border pass, which allows a stay of up to seven days, is being issued to both Indian and Myanmar citizens who can provide documentation verifying their residence within the 10-km zone. This new rule, effective from December 31, is being enforced by State Police, Assam Rifles, and Health Officials at key entry and exit points. Individuals crossing the border will undergo document inspection by Assam Rifles, followed by security and health checks by local authorities. The Assam Rifles will record biometrics and issue a border pass that includes a QR code and photograph. Violations of the new movement rules will result in legal action, with physical checks in place to ensure compliance. The crossing points will operate from Monday to Saturday, between 6:00 am to 3:30 pm.

The new rules restrict movements of people from 16 km under the free movement regime (FMR) to 10 km now, on either side. Only those living in the "border area" - defined as within 10 km on either side - are eligible to apply for the "border pass" for a stay of up to seven days; the pass-holder has to return it at the same crossing point where it was issued. Those living in villages beyond the "border areas" (the 10-km zone) and citizens of any third nation cannot be issued the border pass.

 The border pass will be issued to only one adult, and minors (below 18 years old) have to be accompanied by parents. The details of a maximum number of three children can be captured in a single border pass belonging to either parent, another border pass is to be issued for more than three minors.

 The proof of identity can be issued by the station house officer of the local police station or an equivalent rank in Myanmar's case, and a local village chief or a village authority stating the applicant belongs to the village falling within the 10-km "border area" on either side. The proof of identity document is valid for one year.This new guidelines came into practical w.e.f. 1st Jan. 2025 at Zokhawthar and Hnahlan, Champhai District, Mizoram-Myanmar border.
