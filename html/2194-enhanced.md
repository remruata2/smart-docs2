 The seminar is being sponsored by Luxemburg based donor agency 'Euro-Burma Office' which also sponsored earlier seminar in the past. Lianhmung Sakhong, Chairman CNC Thailand based is expected to attend this seminar.

 CNC plans to conduct the training under a veil of secrecy after the State Government earlier refused permission for training of FBR.

 In this connection, Lianhmung Sakhong, Chairman CNC Thailand based arrived at Aizawl from New Delhi on 22.8.2010 and staying at Hotel Arini, Republic Veng, Aizawl. In view of recent heavy rainfall and floods, it is not clear whether the delegates from Myanmar would be able to attend the training in full strength.
