Subject : Action Taken Report on Comprehensive Framework to Counter Terrorism-reg.

Sir

** Please refer to Assistant Director, SIB Aizawl letter No.AZL/V/2024(19)-994 dated.28.10.2024 regarding Comprehensive Framework to Counter Terrorism, Action Taken Report pertaining to points 8, 10, 11 and 12 of the meeting on ‘Comprehensive Framework to Counter Terrorism’ held on 30th September, 2024 is as under: ******

**Point No. 8: Inputs on Activities of Bangladeshis, Rohingyas, etc having a bearing on Counter Terrorism.**

  At present, there are no Rohingya Refugees or infiltrators in Mizoram. Further, the Rohingya refugees did not settled in the bordering Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh and as such there is no report of activities carried out by the Rohingyas.

**Point No. 10: Fence should be erected on the India-Myanmar border to prevent any illegal immigrants/infiltrators on all our borders, catch them and send them out of India’s borders, in which the roles and responsibilities of all the concerned organizations/departments should be clear at every level, so that a well-planned system can be established.**

 Mizoram shares a 510 kilometers long unfenced international border with Myanmar which runs along six districts of the state such as Champhai, Serchhip, Hnahthial, Lawngtlai, Siaha and Saitual districts. Of the six districts, Champhai shares the longest border with Myanmar.

 Due to the lack of manpower and porous nature of the IMB, formal border pass/ travel documents as prescribed by the Committee on FMR are not issued to the people crossing the border at the IMB. Also, there is no system in place to check or regulate crossing beyond 16 kilometers into the Indian territories. However, random entry of names and particulars of people crossing the IMB is made at Zokhawthar Police Check Gate. Further, the number, particulars and temporary addresses of Myamar refugees entering into Mizoram, India are recorded and maintained by each District Magistrates/Deputy Commissioners.

 The Mizoram Assembly during its Budget Session in the month of February 2024 unanimously adopted an official resolution opposing the Centre’s decision to scrap the Free Movement Regime (FMR) and erection of fencing along the Mizoram sector of the IBM. Moving the official resolution, Mizoram Home Minister Pu K.Sapdanga urged the Centre to reconsider its decision and take steps instead to ensure that the Zo ethnic people can live together without a fence dividing their ancestral land which was falsely geographically divided by the British.

**Point No. 11: Superintendents of Police to be posted in district bordering our international borders should be appointed as per their ability to handle challenging situation efficiently, preferably Superintendents of Police up to 35 years of age who have the zeal and energy to perform arduous duty.**

  Senior officer of the rank of Superintendent of Police having requisite ability to effectively handle challenging situations are posted in the bordering districts of the state. The names of the officers are listed below:

1. Lunglei  –  Shri. J. Lalmuankima – 45 years
2. Siaha  –  Shri. K. L. Vulmawia – 44 years
3. Champhai  –  Shri. Shivendu Bhushan – 31 years
4. Lawngtlai  –  Shri. Lokeshwaran R. – 31 years
5. Mamit  –  Shri. Pukhraj Kamal – 32 years

7. Saitual  –  Shri. Gaurav Tyagi – 29 years
8. Hnahthial  –  Shri. Manny Bhushan Singh – 35 years

****Point No. 12: About 300-500 police officers should be identified from across the country who have the requisite zeal and enthusiasm to take up counter-terrorism work and should be properly trained for utilization by the State Police and various agencies engaged in counter-terrorism work.****
