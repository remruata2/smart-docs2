At the same time Bru Student Association and Bru Welfare Committee were also formed to promote the welfare of Brus in Mizoram. In 1994 the RDP, BSA and BWC at a joint conference formed a new political party called the Bru National Union(BNU) by merging the three organisations. The BNU conference held in September, 1997 at Saipuilui village in Mamit District adopted a resolution for creation of Autonomous District Council for Brus in the western part of Mizoram which was strongly objected by the Mizo community in the concerned area. At the same time a militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF) which was formed in 1996 under the Presidenship of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became more and more active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news about the killing had spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by BNU. Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram at the instance of the BNLF for their operational convenience.</span></strong></span></span></p>

Nevertheless, there are two known armed groups who operated in the Mizoram-Tripura border and Mizoram-Assam border who had secret understanding with some leaders of MBDPF who could be utilised when the need arise. The existence of these armed groups was revealed based on the revelation made by one of their leaders arrested by Mizoram Police named Henry recently. Reliable information received stated that this very group are the one who gave warning to refugees not to obey the Govt&#39;s plan of repatriation and who instilled fears amongst the Bru Refugees.</span></strong></span></span></p>
