No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/307

Dated: 8th May, 2019.

 ICFAI Students’ Action Committee held a meeting at their campus today, i.e. 8.5.2019 @ 10 : 00 a.m. which was chaired by Zothanmawia Khiangte, Vice President, and attended by 15 members. The meeting had a review of the action taken by students and faculty in pursuance to their problems. The meeting decided to meet the visiting Chancellor at Aijal Club with a request not to leave Aizawl until the Study Team complete their inquiry, and to submit a petition personally to him in this regard. Pursuant to this, the ICFAI students proceeded en masse towards Aijal Club @ 2:00. p.m. About 50 students including faculty members gathered outside the main gate of Aijal Club 3:00 p.m. The ICFAI University Chancellor however regretted the students’ request stating that he could not stay in Aizawl and would be back on 20.5.2019. Angered by the negative response of the Chancellor, the students burnt the effigy of the Chancellor impromptu outside the gate which was followed by speeches delivered by Lalnunpuia, President, Students’ Action Committee asserting firm commitment to pursue their cause and not to falter until they succeed. Office Bearers of the ICFAI Students’ Action Committee and Office Bearers of MSU will hold a meeting later tonight at MSU Office. Situation under close watch.
