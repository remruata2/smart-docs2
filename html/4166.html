Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018 which end the over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). However, a faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate along with a handful of his followers, who refused to come over ground during the Peace Accord signed by HPC(D) and government of Mizoram in the year 2018 have started resurfacing and reorganise themselves in recent years.</span></span></span></span></p>

The callers in some cases threatened the call receivers to persuade the villagers not to cast their votes for some particular political parties while demanding money from others. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the political turmoil in the neighbouring state and countries of Mizoram (Manipur, Bangladesh and Myanmar), a considerable numbers of IDPs and refugees, particularly Zo-ethnic tribes have been entering Mizoram in the last two/three years, seeking asylum. One consequence of these refugees entering Mizoram is the possibilities of these refugees/foreigners obtaining fake Indian documents such as voters ID cards, Aadhar cards etc. through illegal means as they are, as mentioned before, Zo-ethnic tribes, speaking the same dialect and following the same traditions/customs.</span></span></span></span></p>

So far, two enquiries had been conducted by CID (SB) in alleged procurement of illegal Indian IDs.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the enquiry revealed that one Myanmar National had acquired Indian Voters ID (EPIC Card) which was eventually surrendered by the defaulter after being exposed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other enquiry revealed that PAN Cards and Aadhar Cards were procured through illegal means in Aizawl and other places. In this connection, a case vide Kawnpui PS Case Number 13/23 dated 15.06.2023 under section 468/180 (B) IPC r/w 14 Foreigners Act was registered which was later re-registered by Crime and Economic Offences Wing Police station as C&amp;EO PS Case Number 14/23 dated 30.08.2023 u/s 468/120 (b) IPC r/w 14 Foreigners Act.&nbsp; Investigation of the case had&nbsp; led to the arrest of 6 (six) accused persons.</span></span></span></span></p>

This issue has to be taken seriously not only for the 2024 Parliamentary election, but for any future elections to be faced by the state</span></span></span></span></p>

After each church denomination and each group held a discussion on the proposal within their own respective Church or group, on September 1st, 2005, their respective representatives came together and formally accepted the formation of the Mizoram People Forum(MPF) so that a greater initiative can be taken towards the improvement of politics within the state. After careful consideration deliberation and assessment of the objectives, it was deemed satisfactory and so the Mizoram People Forum (MPF) was formally formed on 21st June, 2006.</span></span></span></span></p>

For this, an agreement, commonly known as &ldquo;Articles of Agreement&rdquo; was signed between MPF and all the political parties of Mizoram. The joint efforts of these political parties and the Mizoram People Forum in implementing this agreement have been a great success in the past elections.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MPF is an organisation in Mizoram which all political parties/candidates dare not cross openly. As such, although it is a non government organisation, proper utilisation of its man-powers/ members can greatly reduce the burden of shortages of police force in the state after election has been declared as most of the MPF members are prominent and locally respected persons in their respective community.</span></span></span></span></p>
