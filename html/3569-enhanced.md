****No progress in PAHOSS Scheme:**  Not much progress has been achieved for a long time in the Parking House Support Scheme (PAHOSS) , a scheme undertaken by the state government to counter traffic jams in Aizawl city. The reason behind this is the freezing of allotted funds for the scheme, Rs.7002 lakhs as K-deposit for a considerable period of time. So far, Rs.1132.30 lakhs have been distributed as assistance for construction of parking houses while the remaining Rs.4987 are presently stuck in K-deposit.**

 When completed, PAHOSS scheme is expected to accommodate 4211 LMVs and 9017 two wheelers for parking spaces.

****No shortage of essential commodities :******After a slight problem faced by Mizoram in importing essential commodities from outside the state due to landslides and floods, the conditions started to regain normalcy slowly. According to Dr. Andrew H.Vanlaldika, Director, Food, civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs (FCS&amp;CA), the order for controlling of sales of petrol has also been lifted and there in no reason to panic. However, permission for sales is still required from the department by petroleum dealers if their reserve is down to 5,000 litres in petrol and 7,000 litres in diesel. Officials of FCS&amp;CA further stated that the state is having sufficient stock of rice while supply of other essential commodities from outside are increasing daily as the floods of neighbouring states began to subside.**
