Subject :  Reproduction of Enquiry Report

Sir,

I am to state that enquiry into the suspicious transaction into the private bank account of Pu Sushil Jiban Chakma, employee of CADC, Kamalanagar, Lawngtlai District, Mizoram was conducted by Inspr. HT Sapsanga, SO, CID (SB), Lawngtlai whose report is translated and reproduced in English and am herby submitting it for your kind perusal and further necessary action.

“In response to your order, I have enquired about the suspicious transaction of Mr. Sushil Jiban Chakma, CADC, Kamalanagar, Lawngtlai District, Mizoram who worked as cashier with a private Bank Account No. 00000011695402797 other than the previous report which I submitted earlier (12.10.09). The current document is enclosed.

My enquiry findings of Mr. Sushil Jiban Chakma (Ex-Cashier), who is now an Assistant at CADC’s, Private Bank Account (Suspicious Transaction) are as follows:-

1.  On 2nd June, 2009 Mrs. KT Thangi of Electric Veng, Aizawl who worked on the project of Parva-I to Simenasora Road (Upgradation of Parva-I to Simenasora Road under Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resource) requested Mr. Sushil Jiban Chakma to transfer their bill drawn from State Bank of India, Lawngtlai Branch to their account No. 0010763505283 which Mr. Sushil Jiban Chakma transferred from his Private Bank Account No. 00000011695402797.

I have also enclosed the (1) Work Order (2) Progress Report for Quarter ending September, 2009 and (3) Rs. 233.22 Lakhs of KT Thangi and the authority letter from Executive Secretary, CADC, Kamalanagar.

The cash (Rs. 233.22 lakhs) which the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) Ministry of Finance, suspects does not belong to Mr. Sushil Jiban Chakma, it is the property of the contractor, KT Thangi.

2.  With the permission of the executive secretary, PB Chakma (who does not hold this position at present), Rs. 1.48 lakhs was drawn from Mr. Sushil Jiban Chakma’s Private Account on 5th February, 2009 which is said to have been disbursed. For this withdrawal, Mr. Sushil Jiban Chakma stated that the executive secretary signed in the cheque No. 329801 (CADC).

3.  In 1st July, 2008, a cash of Rs. 2.21 lakhs (HUDCO loan of CADC) was drawn and transferred from Mr. Sushil Jiban Chakma’s Private Account with the permission of CADC’s Executive Secretary, PB Chakma. It is evident that they repay the loan. I have also enclosed the repayment draft of the loan from the Regional Chief, HUDCO, Regional Office, Old Secretariat Complex, Kohima 797001 (Nagaland) which is Rs. 2.21 lakhs, which is in the transaction of Sushil Jiban Chakma’s Private Account. It seems like the money does not belong to him.

4.  Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) Ministry of Finance notify that on 30th April, 2009 there was a transfer debit of Rs. 12.03 lakhs on Sushil Jiban Chakma’s Private Account No. 00000011695402797 this appears to be a mistake mad by the FIU-IND because from my previous enquiry, State Bank of India, Lawngtlai Branch, Sushil Jiban Chakma, Bank statement of account w.e.f. 28.04.08 to 30.06.09, draw/transfer Rs. 12.03 lakhs from his account on 30.4.2008 (not on 30.4.2009). This cash is nor a private cash of Sushil Jiban Chakma but the cash of CADC (HUDCO loan). This cash is said to have been used to repay the HUDCO loan.

My enquiry reveals that the CADC leaders (Executive secretary), let their cashier use their Personal Bank Account for their convenience in dealing with the Bank.

At the time when Mr. Sushil Jiban Chakma opened his account, he was merely a government employee as cashier, but the transaction on his Bank Account shows ‘high value transaction’. For this reason, it seems that the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND), Ministry of Finance were suspicious of him.

The revelation of my enquiry of the transaction of Mr. Sushil Jiban Chakma’s Bank Account which FIU-IND suspected are written above”.

I therefore submitted herewith enclosed copy in order to take further investigation and necessary action.

Yours faithfully,
