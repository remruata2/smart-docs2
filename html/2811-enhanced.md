****AGENDA POINTS FOR THE FORTHCOMING NORTH EASTERN REGIONAL POLICE COORDINATION COMMITTEE (NERPCC) MEETING OF THE DsGP OF NORTH-EASTERN STATES PROPOSED TO BE HELD TENTATIVELY ON 3rd Week of March, 2022****

1. **Indo-Myanmar Border Issue:**

 According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of unfenced International border with Myanmar, which are scattered around 30 - 40 small villages in Mizoram side. The Indo-Myanmar borders are guarded by Assam Rifles, who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Due to its long porous international border with Myanmar, influx of foreigners and large scale smuggling of drugs and various contrabands into the state through the porous borders has remained a serious concern for several decades.

 The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar allow Myanmar’s national to enter up to 16 kms into Mizoram Territory without any VISA restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guards Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the Indo-Myanmar.

 Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be of great assets for the government and the border guard alike.

 Having a low profile close ties with ethnic leaders of Chin Hills and Arakan-Rakhine States may also be invaluable for sharing cross-border information.

1. **Myanmarese Refugee Issue**:

Military takeover took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 whendemocratically electedmembers of Myanmar'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy, were deposed by Myanmar's Military. The Myanmar Military proclaimed a year-longstate of emergencyand declared that power had been vested inCommander-in-Chief of Defence ServicesGeneral Min Aung Hlaing. It declared the results of theNovember 2020 general electionas invalid and intended to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency. In protest against the Military takeover that ousted the country’s democratically elected leaders, thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Myanmar. It is reported that following the Coup thousands of Myanmar nationals have taken shelter to neighboring countries viz. India, Bangladesh and Thailand. Due to close ethnic ties thousands of Myanmar Refugees mostly from Chin state fled to Mizoram and Manipur.

The Chin state of Myanmarsharesa border with six districts of Mizoram viz. Champhai, Lawngtlai, Siaha, Saitual, Hnahthial and Serchhip . Most refugees coming in from Chin are from Lai, Tedim-Zomi, Luse, Hualngo and Natu tribes, which share close links with the Mizos of Mizoram, as well as the Kuki-Zomis of Manipur.

****Information received stated that following the Coup more than 21,460 Myanmar refugees have taken shelter within Mizoram as on 6.3.2022. These refugees are taken care at refugees’ camp set up by NGOs and their relatives in Mizoram. Registration of refugees is being undertaken by Home Department through the respective Deputy Commissioners.

_Suggested Measures to be Taken for Prevention of Illegal Entry of Foreigners of Myanmar into Mizoram_:

1. **Strengthening of Security and Intelligence Network along Mizoram-Myanmar Border**:

In addition to deployment of Assam Rifles at the international border, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) at various Border Outposts (BOPs) along the border, supplementing the Central Armed Forces.

Apart from strengthening deployment of Assam Rifles along the border, it is also necessary to set-up new Police Stations/BOPs (with the financial assistance of Central government) along the border areas to act as a second layer behind the Assam Rifles for keeping effective watch on the infiltration of Rohingyas migrants/foreigners and other cross border criminal activities.

1. **Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agencies and Intelligence agencies about Rohingyas Crisis and its security implication, etc.**

Mizoram Police, Assam Rifles etc. should be sensitized about Rohingyas crisis/crisis in Myanmar so as to enable them to take prompt steps in identifying illegal migrants and to initiate the process of deportation, etc. This could be achieved through Seminar, Workshop, etc.

1. **Detection and proper registration of along Mizoram-Myanmar Border.**

 In order to detect illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram , 3 (three) Special Task Force (STF) had already been set up in three districts of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.

__Similarly, Task Group on Myanmar refugees has been set up in all Districts of Mizoram so as to take necessary action for preparation of registration, necessary assistance etc.

1. **Smuggling of Narcotic/Areca nuts:-**

 Mizoram being located at a strategic point in North East India with porous international borders, has been vulnerable and is often used as a conduit for transporting arms and ammunitions, drugs and contraband items by various Insurgent groups and Smugglers. However, due to the sustained efforts only by CID Special Branch of Mizoram Police, during the year of 2021 upto 15.2.2022 the following seizures were made:

| **Year** | **Name of Drug seized** | **Quantity** | **Value (in Rs)** | **No. of case regd** | **No. of person arrested** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2021- upto feb, 2022  | Heroin | 15.792 Kgs | Rs. 5,68,51,200/- | 101 | 130 |
|  | Ganja | 28.476 Kgs | Rs. 1,42,380/- | 9 | 11 |
|  | Cough Syrup | 27 Bottles | Rs. 4,050/- | 2 | 2 |
|  | Methamphetamine | 153.778 Kgs | Rs. 46,13,34,000/- | 10 | 21 |
|  | Tramadol | 171.83 gms (35 strips) | Rs. 29,400/- | 1 | 1 |
| **TOTAL** |  |  | **Rs. 51,83,57,380/-** | **123** | **165** |


******Besides, contraband goods coming from Myanmar side, huge amount of Areca nuts were illegally entering into Mizoram through Myanmar – Mizoram border, It has also negatively affected the economic growth of the State. Seizure of Areca nuts made by Mizoram Police during 2019 to 2022 is as follows:**

 2019 -  81,600 kgs

 2020 - 3,40,620 kgs

 2021 - 4,70,510 kgs

 _2022 - 21,200 kgs_

 **Total: 9,13,930 kgs**

1. **Inter-State Border Issues**:

 Border Issues with Assam:

******Assam and Mizoram share 164.6 km inter-state boundary. There have been skirmishes on both sides earlier as both sides claiming portions of land along the boundary as theirs. Residents of Mizoram claimed that 1875 notification should be the boundary between Assam and Mizoram, while Assam claimed 1933 notification as the constitutional boundary between the two states.**

For the people of Mizoram, the only known and accepted boundary between Mizoram and Assam is the Inner Line on the Southern Frontier of the District also known as **The Inner Line of the Lushai Hills, 1875**which was notified****on 20th August, 1875 under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873 as subsequently revised in 1878.

This is also the boundary recognized by and in actual practice both by the people residing in border areas and even by the Assam Government.

There are three points which have been regarded as the boundary points between Cachar and Mizo Hills in practice. These are Kukichera on the Dhaleswari river, Duarband on the old Silchar- Aizawl road and Baga Bazar (Banga Bazar) on the present Silchar-Aizawl road (NH-54). Government servants on transit were regarded to have passed the boundary between Cachar District and Mizo Hills at these points (Vide Assam Fundamental Rule 106 read with Subsidiary Rule, 137).

Therefore, considering all the historical background as well as facts and circumstances of the recent past that are still related amongst the Mizos, it is not possible for the Mizos to accept the imaginary lines, which was drawn without their knowledge or consultation in 1933.

The three South Assam districts of Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj share border with Mizoram’s Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl districts. Mizoram was part of Assam till 1972, when it became a separate Union Territory. In 1987, it became a full-fledged state. While the two states have sparred over the border in the past, the stand-offs have been relatively non-violent and low-key compared to Assam’s dispute with its other neighbours – Nagaland, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh – on the same matter.

It is suggested that border both states should maintain status quo within the disputed area and any incident which could escalate tension which immediately be settled through dialogue. Concerned DCs and SsP of the bordering districts should conduct routine meeting to review the situation.
