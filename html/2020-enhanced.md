 I was from Wabagai Mayal Leikai village, Manipur, having two brothers and one sisters. I studied upto Class X in Khianglam High School.

 I enrolled myself in PREPAK in the year 1996 in the month of February as SS Private and I got promotion in the rank of Corporal in the year 2007. Our Headquarters is at Thingnungan Myanmar and established a training camp at Khamti which is also in Myanmar.

We had undergone weapon training under Naga National Council instructors.

 In the year 2007 PREPAK was splitted into four groups and I followed one of the factions led by Chinglemba which is name United Peoples Party of Kangleipak We, UPPK comprised around 70-80 outfits of various rank having weapons of different types like AK-47,RPG-7 M-23,M-16, 60 MM Mortar, Pistol , I don’t know the exact amount of weapon we are possessing.

 Aims and objective of UPPK is to achieve economic self sufficient of Manipur which we turned it ‘ Green Revolution’ and to eradicate corruption in the state of Manipur.

 I and my friends M.Rogen Singh and Homeshor Singh were directed to proceed to Aizawl by our top leader Chinglemba to purchase a second hand vehicle Gypsy or Maruti from Aizawl to Guwahati for use of our group. While reaching river Tiau we were received by one driver and other unknown person by red colour Maruti (Zen) and carried us upto Aizawl. The unknown fellow could speak broken Manipuri language and we arrived Aizawl on 9.1.2009 @ 11:00 PM and lodged at K.T.Hotel which is arranged by one driver and his friend.
