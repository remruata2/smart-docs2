****INDO-MYANMAR BORDER ISSUES****

 Mizoram is having approximately 404 kms. porous international borders with Myanmar which are vulnerable to use by Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs. Besides, the Look East Policy actively pursued by Central and State Government is bound to bring our neighbours, i.e. Myanmar and other Asian Countries closer to our country in general and Mizoram in particular in all kinds of economic activity.

 Further, the upcoming Kolodyne Multimodal Project and Highway Project to connect Myanmar from the southern part of Mizoram would widely open trade and commerce activities manifold which would also have the potential to generate criminal activities such as - Arms Smuggling, Drugs Trafficking and International Terrorist Groups to cross over the border. Such activities will need to be effectively countered and neutralized at all costs in the interest of national security as a whole and the North Eastern region in particular.

****THE FREE MOVEMENT REGIME ALONG THE INDO-MYANMAR BORDER****:****

_Brief history :_

 The Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that enables citizens of both countries to travel freely within a 16-kilometer radius of the border for up to 72 hours without the need for a visa. This initiative aims to preserve traditional ties and alleviate insecurity for tribal communities residing along the border.

 The FMR spans 1,629.5 kilometers of unfenced border shared between four Indian states - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram - and Myanmar. In January 2018, the Union Cabinet approved a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance economic interactions through this regime.

 However, concerns have been raised regarding the regime's misuse. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, militants and criminals are exploiting the FMR to smuggle weapons, narcotics, and counterfeit currency, taking advantage of the regime's leniencies to cross borders and evade capture.

1. _Enhancing Security and Mobility :_

 To address the existing challenges, a high-level committee chaired by the Special Secretary (Internal Security) was constituted in August 2017. The committee's terms of reference encompass the development of standardized operating procedures and guidelines for the Free Movement Regime (FMR), delineation of roles and responsibilities for central and state agencies, and the creation of a uniform Border Pass system.

 This secure pass will facilitate regulated movement within the 16-kilometer border area, with stringent controls to prevent misuse. Furthermore, the committee plans to introduce biometric cards for local residents and implement measures to prevent unauthorized vehicle crossings. These enhanced security protocols aim to strike a balance between the benefits of the FMR and the need to safeguard the interests of both nations and their border communities.

 Mizoram shares a 510-kilometer-long border with Myanmar, which remains unfenced and porous. Six districts in the state adjoin the international border, with Champhai district sharing the longest border with Myanmar.

1. _Border Fencing and Free Movement Regime Abolition :_

 On February 28, 2024, the Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Indian government’s proposal to build a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and to abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR). Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution expresses concerns that these measures would negatively impact the Zo ethnic communities, which have been historically divided by the border established during British colonial rule. The Assembly contends that strengthening this division with additional barriers would disturb the livelihoods and social connections of the border communities.

1. _FMR New Guidelines (Free Movement Limit On Indo-Myanmar Border Tightened to 10 Km, With Border Pass) :_

1. The Indian government has introduced new regulations to oversee movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). On December 24, 2024, the MHA announced a revised protocol that decreases the Free Movement Regime (FMR) range, shrinking it from 16 km to 10 km. Despite Union Home Minister Amit Shah's earlier statement in February of the previous year, suggesting the FMR would be abolished, a formal notification has yet to be issued.

 Security along the 510-km border has been intensified, and now residents residing within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border must secure a Border Pass for travel. This Border Pass permits a stay of up to seven days and is provided to both Indian and Myanmar citizens who present documentation verifying their residency within the 10-km zone. Effective from December 31, enforcement is executed by State Police, Assam Rifles, and Health Officials at major entry and exit points. Individuals crossing the border will undergo document scrutiny by the Assam Rifles, followed by security and health evaluations by local authorities. The Assam Rifles will record biometrics and issue a Border Pass featuring a QR code and photograph. Non-compliance with the new movement regulations will lead to legal repercussions, with physical verifications in place to ensure adherence. The crossing points will be operational from Monday to Saturday, between 6:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.

 The new regulations restrict the movement of individuals from 16 km under the previous FMR to 10 km now, on either side. Only those residing in the "border area"—defined as within 10 km on either side—are eligible to apply for the "Border Pass" for up to a seven-day stay; such pass-holders are required to return it at the same crossing point where it was issued. Residents of villages beyond the "border areas" (the 10-km zone) and citizens of any third country are ineligible for the Border Pass.

A border pass will be issued to only one adult, and minors (under 18 years of age) must be accompanied by a parent. The details for up to three children can be included in a single border pass belonging to either parent; a separate border pass is required for more than three minors.

Proof of identity can be provided by the station house officer of the local police station or a person of equivalent rank in Myanmar, as well as by a local village chief or village authority, certifying that the applicant resides in the village situated within the 10-kilometer "border area" on either side. This proof of identity document is valid for one year. These new guidelines will take effect starting January 1, 2025, at Zokhawthar and Hnahlan, located in Champhai District, along the Mizoram-Myanmar border.

1. The recent stringent measures imposed by the Government of India at the border have significantly strained communication between Myanmar and Mizoram. The Zokhawthar Bridge serves as the primary conduit, yet the new regulations have restricted passage for many individuals. These rules mandate the possession of a valid border pass. Even with a border pass, those not hailing from Champhai District face restrictions in crossing into Myanmar.

In Mizoram, the police are responsible for security and identity checks of individuals attempting to cross the border. Afterward, the Assam Rifles issue the border pass. Despite these measures, the long queues deter many who decide to turn back rather than wait. Reports indicate that border crossing traffic has plummeted by approximately 50%. Since July last year, only pedestrians have been permitted to cross, causing a significant setback in border trade and resulting in widespread job losses.

For identification, an Aadhar Card or Voter ID is required, effectively barring refugees from crossing. On the Myanmar side, the absence of a stable government has resulted in areas being controlled by the Hualngo People's Organisation, which now issues border passes from their side.

****MYANMAR REFUGEE**:**

_Brief history_ –

The resistance efforts by the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and the armed ethnic groups in Chin State, Myanmar, have been ongoing to dismantle the military regime that seized power on February 1, 2021. This conflict has led to a significant influx of refugees, particularly from the Chin community, into Mizoram. Since the military coup, there have been eight major waves of Myanmar nationals seeking refuge in the state. Leaders of these ethnic groups convened for a workshop in Aizawl on September 7-8, 2023, with the aim of establishing an interim government in Chinland.

In addition to the Chin community, clashes between the Myanmar Army of the State Administration Council (SAC) and the Arakan Army in Rakhine State have intensified. Following the Arakan Army's capture of most major cities, members of the Khumi tribe have fled to southern Mizoram, reportedly escaping the Arakan Army’s atrocities.

 Since May 15, 2024, the Chin National Army (CNA), supported by various ethnic armed groups under the Chinland Council, launched a military operation against the State Administration Council’s Myanmar Army and the Eastern Command camps of the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) within Tonzang Township. By May 19, 2024, the CNA and its allies had reportedly seized most camps, including Dampui Camp (ZRA), Nakzaang Camp (Myanmar Army), Chikha Camp (Myanmar Army), Eliza Camp, Suansang (ZRA), and Tonzang Town Camp (Myanmar Army). By December 2024, the Chin Brotherhood Alliance had further captured Myanmar Army camps in Mindat, Matupi, Kanpetlet, Hakha, and Thantlang towns.

 During these clashes, the Myanmar Army retaliated with airstrikes on Tonzang Town, Nakzaang, and Lungtak villages, causing civilians to flee these areas. Fearing further airstrikes, many of these displaced individuals sought refuge and safety in neighboring villages within Mizoram.

**KMMTTP :**

 The Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) is a strategic infrastructure initiative by the Government of India. It involves a multimodal transport route that combines land, river, and sea segments to connect Northeast India with Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal. The route covers a distance of 882.21 kilometers and includes multiple modes of transportation.

**Lawngtlai to Zorinpui (Mizoram)**: land route 87.51 kms.

**Zorinpui Border to Kaletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 45 kms.

**Kaletwa to Paletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 60.70 kms.

**Paletwa to Sittwe (Myanmar)**: 150 km river route.

**Sittwe to Kolkata Port (Bay of Bengal)**: 539 km sea route.

 As of June 2024, construction of the KMMTTP land route within Mizoram is complete, although it is occasionally disrupted by landslides due to heavy rainfall. Meanwhile, owing to ongoing conflicts in Myanmar, only about 10 kilometers of earthwork has been completed on the land route between Zorinpui and Paletwa by the Myanmar New Power Construction Company, the firm assigned to the project.

 Since February 2024, the Arakan Army, which primarily consists of ethnic Arakanese from Myanmar's Rakhine State, has reportedly taken control of most of Rakhine State, including some parts of Chin State. This control extends over the proposed route of the KMMTTP within Myanmar, with the exception of Sittwe. However, due to ongoing clashes between the Myanmar Army and resistance forces elsewhere in Myanmar, the Arakan Army and the civilians in Rakhine State have become heavily reliant on goods and petroleum products transported largely through Mizoram, notably Lawngtlai and Siaha Districts. Concurrently, tensions between the Arakan Army and Chin ethnic armed groups in Myanmar have led the Central Young Lai Association (CYLA) to ban the transport of essential goods and petroleum oil into Myanmar, in solidarity with their Chin counterparts since April 2024. Currently, the ban is restricted only to the transportation of petroleum oil and fertilizers through Lawngtlai District.

1. **Surrendering of Myanmar Army**:

******Intensified military operations conducted by armed ethnic groups in Myanmar's Chin State and Rakhine State led to a significant surrender of Myanmar Army personnel to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles from late 2023 onwards.**

In November and December 2023, a total of 255 Myanmar Army personnel surrendered in Mizoram's Champhai, Siaha, and Lawngtlai districts. This was followed by another 380 personnel surrendering in January 2024 within Lawngtlai and Siaha districts. Initially, Assam Rifles airlifted the surrendered personnel back to Myanmar via helicopter. Later, they were evacuated by Myanmar military aircraft from Lengpui Airport. However, on January 23, 2024, a Myanmar aircraft scheduled to evacuate the remaining 92 personnel crash-landed at Lengpui Airport, injuring six crew members on board.

 Fortunately, there were no serious injuries or casualties. The last batch of surrendered personnel was eventually evacuated by two Myanmar Air Force special flights on January 24, 2024. Till date (i.e. 07.01.2025), a total of 635 Myanmar Army personnel had surrendered to Mizoram Police and Indian security personnel in Mizoram.

1. **Biometric enrolment of refugees:**

The Mizoram government has decided to collect biometric data from Myanmar and Bangladesh refugees, but with the condition that they won't be deported until peace is restored in their home countries. The state's Home department has reached out to the Union Ministry to modify the Foreigner's Identification Portal (FIP) to accommodate these refugees.

Currently, the FIP is designed to track and deport illegal immigrants. The state is awaiting a response from the Centre regarding this request. In the meantime, the Centre has extended the biometric enrollment deadline to December 2024. The Union Home Minister has also assured the Chief Minister that the refugees won't be deported until peace prevails in their respective countries. It's worth noting that the biometric data collection process has been delayed due to ongoing discussions with the Centre.
