Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent unlawful activities thus jeopardising law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area. Government of Mizoram managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants resulting in the signing of a Peace Accord on 27<sup>th</sup> July, 1994. HPC militants surrendered formally to the Govt. of Mizoram as per the provision of this Accord and these persons were given financial grants for their rehabilitation etc. Govt. of Mizoram also agreed to set up the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) for the socio-economic upliftment of the people living in Hmar dominated areas. Accordingly, adhoc Chairman and members constituting the Council were appointed by Govt. of Mizoram from among leaders of the erstwhile HPC set up. </span></span></span></span></p>
