**PRISM lodged FIR**: PRISM, Champhai Sub-Hqrs. lodged an FIR to ACB regarding their suspicion of the Mahal in selling sand of Tiau River at exorbitant rate.

 According to PRISM, people who claimed to be Mahaldar at Tiau River in the Burma border charged money to traders of sand of Tiau River which, as a result, increased the price of sand. If Mahal were not there, sand of Tiau river__could be purchased for around ` 2,000/- to ` 2,500/- in Champhai but the rate is ` 5,000/- to ` 5,500/- due to the extra money charged by the Mahalder which is suffered by the buyers. PRISM do not like this and probed into the matter and asked for the workings of Mahal through RTI Act at Directorate of Geology and Mineral Resources, the directorate told them that Mahal is not appointed at Tiau river. It seemed that Mahal at Tiau River are not officially appointed and need to be investigated, so PRISM, Champhai Sub-Hqrs. lodged an FIR against them.
