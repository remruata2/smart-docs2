**Pineapple growers faced difficulties:******Pineapple Growers of Sialsuk town faced severe problems regarding the sales of their harvested products. During previous year, these growers sold off their products to Aizawl market through some middlemen at the rate of Rs.10 per KG. However, this year, these middlemen could not buy huge quantities from the growers as the market of pineapple in Aizawl is declining allegedly due to lack of sufficient circulation of money in the city and towns. The growers are extremely alarmed of their present situation as their products decomposed easily in the present hot climatic weather. During this season, members of Sialsuk Pineapple Growers Association, where there are 239 members, expected to harvest around 10,000 quintals of pineapple in comparison to 6,800 quintals of last year.
