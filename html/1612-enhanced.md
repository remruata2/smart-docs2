**INCIDENT AT ZOPHAI NEAR BAIRABI AT MIZORAM-ASSAM BORDER**

****On 8.3.2018, members of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) numbering around 70 (seventy) under the leadership of L. Ramdinliana, President, MZP left Aizawl for Zophai near Bairabi, Kolasib District with an intention to reconstruct 'Zofate Chawlhbuk' (Shed) at the disputed site along Mizoram-Assam border.

 At around 11:45 am, a minor scuffle broke out between the Student union and Assam Police when some members of the student union tried to unload their building materials from the vehicle. The Assam Police had even resorted to Lathi-charge as a result of which around 15 (fifteen) MZP members reportedly sustained minor injuries.

 On 10.3.2018 @ around 11:00 a.m, a scuffle broke out again between Assam Police and members of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) when around 100 (hundred) strong MZP members proceeded to the disputed site at Zophai near Bairabi along Assam - Mizoram border with their building materials to reconstruct ‘Zofate Chawlhbuk’ at the site. The students were intercepted by Assam Police before they reached the disputed site and they subsequently used force to disperse them. It was reported that the Assam Police initially used Lathi but later on resorted to firing and around 8 (eight) shots were reportedly fired as a result of which one Ricky Lalchhandama, Secretary i/c Establishment, MZP reportedly sustained gunshot injury on his right ankle and around 49 (forty nine) others sustained injuries on their persons. Out of 49 (forty nine) injured MZP members, 7 (seven) of them reportedly sustained serious injuries and were referred to other Hospitals for necessary treatment. It was also reported that 8 (eight) media persons also sustained injuries. The Assam Police burnt down the temporary shed constructed by the MZP near the disputed site and several vehicles belonging to MZP members were also ransacked by Assam Police.

 Consequence to this incident Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) organised a procession at Aizawl on 12.3.2018 and passed the following resolutions :-

i) MZP strongly condemned the Assam Government for invoking Section 144CrPC on  the soil of Mizoram and also condemned the State Government for turning a deaf ear  to the border issue.

ii) Government of Mizoram should protect the boundary of the State.

iii) MZP will continue to render utmost effort to protect Mizoram and her people.

iv) 'Zofate Chawlhbuk' should be reconstructed.
