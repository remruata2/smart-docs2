However, when prominent citizens of E.Lungdar were consulted, it was found that no persons were known by them who could be connected with collection of these types of pillars. The name- Mawia Hmar and the house no. given were out of question as far as this town is concerned.</span></span></p>

Lungleng was again scrutinized (in case there is spelling mistake on the part of the given address).Even former inhabitants, who had left the village were also considered. This resulted in the uncovering of one person &ndash; Chawiliana, former residence of N. Lungleng village.</span></span></p>

He left the village&nbsp; more than 20 years ago to pursue further studies and professions. He served as an evangelist in Tripura under Seventh Day Adventist for a couple of years before studying and completing B.D from ATS, Jowai, Meghalaya. However, as he had been already over-age, he could not pursue pastoral job under Seventh Day Adventist Church and now runs a small business shop in Vaivakawn. Presently, he and his family are residing in a rented flat belonging to Pastor Biakthansanga at Vaivakawn.</span></span></p>

According to him, being an evangelist, he collected all the relevant informations to curb villagers from scaring each other with tales relating to the pillar. He became extremely interested in this issue. He even mentioned that he had visited different places in Mizoram where these pillars are said to exist, but without any success.</span></span></p>

On the other hand, it can only be a mere coincidence, as the house No. given i.e. 91 (assuming it is from N.Lungleng) belongs to Mr.Lalzidinga while the House No. of Chawiliana (presently occupied by his parents)&nbsp; is 146.</span></span></p>

He also totally denied submitting any such application himself or using parts of his brother&#39;s name. He however, added his willingness to pursue this business if such permission could be granted by the government.</span></span></p>

He has given an entirely wrong address using a village in Aizawl district which does not exist. It is likely that any acknowledgement which may be forwarded will not reach him at all in his given address. Due to the above circumstances, the applicant may be considered a fraud or an imposter which cannot be taken as legitimate.</span></span></p>
