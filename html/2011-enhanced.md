 This is the first time I came to Mizoram. I had visited Sikkim in 2009 to sell clothes. I lost my ID Card in Vaseikai during my illness. I came to Delhi to Guwahati by train with Rajiv Sharma. I had my pass made by Rajiv Sharma for entering Mizoram. After reaching Silchar from Guwahati we reached Aizawl and straightly proceeded to Champhai and stayed here for around 10 days. Then we went to Serchhip - Lunglei - Vaseikai - Parva.
