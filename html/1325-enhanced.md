****WRITE-UP FOR DGP/IGP CONFERENCE- 2017****

****I. Overview of State Security****

The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful during 2017 (i.e. January 2017-29th December, 2017). Although peaceful, Mizoram is surrounded by countries and states which are having many disturbances with respect to insurgency and terrorism. The porous international border areas and peaceful atmosphere of Mizoram have unfortunately served as preferred routes for insurgent groups and other criminal elements to smuggle arms, ammunition and contraband drugs, etc.

Mizoram is having a stretch of approximately 510 Kms. and 318 Kms. porous International borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively. Further, the ‘Act East Policy’ actively pursued by the Central Government and the State Government is bound to bring our International/foreign neighbours closer to our Country in general and Mizoram in particular. Again, the construction of Kaladan Multi Modal Transit Transport Project and Highway project to connect Myanmar from southern part of Mizoram is in full progress. The aforesaid factors would definitely affect the commercial activities of stakeholder countries to a great extent and thereby creating opportunities for smuggling all kinds of contraband goods/items. This angle requires effective handling and control at all cost by strengthening intelligence network, constant vigil &amp; surveillance, frequent patrolling, manning regular check posts, etc.

The State of Mizoram has recently witnessed cross border incidents like fleeing of 1440 Nos. of Myanmarese (As on 19.12.2017) from villages like Varang, etc., under Paletwa township of Chin State, Myanmar into the following villages of Mizoram due to fierce clashes between Arakan Army (AA) militants and the Myanmar Army (MA).
