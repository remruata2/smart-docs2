****WRITE-UP ON FIP AND PAP IN MIZORAM****

**Foreigners Identification Portal (FIP):**

The Foreigners Identification Portal (FIP) is designed for recording the personal and biometric information of foreign nationals residing illegally. Currently, access to FIP is limited to the District Deputy Commissioner in Mizoram, as the Police Department does not yet have access.

In a Council of Ministers meeting held on September 27, 2023, at 10:30 AM in the Chief Minister's Office Cabinet Room, the issue of documenting the biographic and biometric data of illegal migrants in Mizoram was addressed. It was concluded that, given the impending General Elections to the Mizoram State Assembly, the Government of Mizoram should not undertake the collection of such data. Therefore, the identification of foreigners residing illegally is not feasible at this time.

Consequently, the Commissioner &amp; Secretary to the Mizoram Government's Home Department was asked to guide the Police Department on using the Foreigners Identification Portal through letter No. MSB/VB-56/2024/4 dated March 18, 2024. A reply from the relevant authority is still awaited.

The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Foreigners Identification Portal, under the Foreigners Division, MHA, currently utilized by the Government of Mizoram, was created by NIC, MHA on February 2, 2024.

1. The FIP comprises six fields:

 1) Application Details (Mandatory)

 2) Address Details in Origin Country (Mandatory)

 3) Address Details in India (Mandatory)

 4) Identity Details (Mandatory)

 5) Occupation in Origin Country

 6) Occupation in India

2. The State Government has no objections, and the foreigners have no issues regarding the application details.

3. Foreigners, particularly displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh, do not possess e-mail IDs, which are mandatory for the Address Detail field.

4. In the mandatory Address Details in India section, State Government officials and displaced individuals from Myanmar and Bangladesh are unable to specify their Entry Dates into India accurately. These individuals often enter through multiple points and frequently travel back and forth due to circumstances in their home countries. Additionally, they cannot determine the required Area Code, which is also mandatory.

5. The section on the Agency or Individual responsible for sending individuals to India is irrelevant for displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh.

6. Regarding the mandatory Identity Details, displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh lack the necessary documents for uploading to the Portal. Additionally, there is difficulty in uploading the Myanmar embassy form, as the State Government does not have access to it.

7. There are no issues with the Occupation in Origin Country and Occupation in India fields, as these are not mandatory.

8. Due to strong ancestral ties with displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh, and considering the unstable political situations in Myanmar and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the State Government believes that deporting or pushing back these refugees should not be pursued until their safety and security can be assured. Consequently, the State Government suggests that the relevance of the Embassy Form be reconsidered by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

**Notes:**

1. The Embassy Form is to be reviewed by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). It will be communicated with the embassies of the concerned countries in India to confirm the nationality of the illegal migrants/displaced persons, facilitating the issuance of necessary travel documents for their immediate deportation.

2. Regarding the capture of biometric details of displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh under the NAFIS Portal, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) finalized necessary revisions to the portal to accommodate the specific needs of these displaced individuals on May 3, 2024.

****Protected Area Regime in the State of Mizoram****:****

**Protected Area Coverage in Mizoram:**

- According to Section 3 of the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, no foreign national is permitted to enter or remain in a protected area without obtaining a permit issued by the Central Government or an authorized officer.

- As outlined in Section 2(a) of the same order, a 'protected area' is defined as any border area that lies beyond the inner line, as detailed in Schedule I.

- Schedule I of the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, specifies that the inner line in Mizoram extends from the tri-junction of Manipur, Mizoram, and Assam, following the northern and western borders of Mizoram up to the international boundary.

**Current System for Issuing Protected Area Permits to Foreigners for Entry into Mizoram:**

- According to Section 3 of the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, "No foreigner shall enter or remain in any protected area except under and in accordance with a permit issued by the Central Government or any officer authorized by the Central Government."

- Previously, travel agents would apply on behalf of foreigners wishing to enter Mizoram. The Secretary of the Home Department was responsible for issuing these entry permits to foreigners. The entire process of application submission and permit issuance was conducted manually.

**Suspension of the Protected Area Permit (PAP):**

- The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, via Notification No. 25022/160/2010-F.I dated December 30, 2010, suspended the Protected Area Permit requirement from January 1, 2011, for a duration of one year.

- The suspension of PAP in Mizoram has been extended periodically by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The most recent extension was executed via Notification No. 25022/160/2010-F.I dated December 16, 2022, extending the suspension up to December 31, 2027.

**Withdrawal of Protected Area Suspension Order:**

- On December 17, 2024, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, issued an order (ref. No. 25022/160/2010-F.I (Part.I)(i) dated 17.12.2024) immediately canceling the Protected Area Permit (PAP) suspension. Consequently, the entire regions of Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland have been reinstated as protected areas under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, due to increased security concerns along their borders.

- Furthermore, the Ministry of Home Affairs has mandated that all PAP/RAP applications be processed exclusively through the e-FRRO Portal. No physical PAP/RAP permits will be issued under any circumstances as per the directive (Letter No. 25022/160/2010-F.I (Part.I)(ii) dated 17.12.2024).

**Current Status:**

- Mizoram falls under the jurisdiction of the Foreigner Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) in Kolkata, along with other northeastern states.

- The Senior Superintendent of Police, CID (SB), serves as the State Nodal Officer and the State Foreigner Registration Officer (FRO). Additionally, it acts as the District FRO for Aizawl District.

- Each District's Superintendent of Police in Mizoram performs the role of District FRO for their respective districts.

- In line with the directive from the Ministry of Home Affairs requiring that all PAP/RAP applications be processed through the e-FRRO Portal, a training session on Immigration Visa Foreigner Registration Tracking (IVFRT), PAP, and RAP was held on January 10, 2025. This training was organized for the State FRO and all District FROs at the Cyber Forensic cum Training Centre, SP Office, Aizawl, Mizoram and was conducted by the Deputy Director of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), Mizoram.

**Procedure for Applying to Enter and Tracking Foreigners in e-FRRO:**

Any foreign national wishing to enter a Protected Area (such as Mizoram) must:

 a) Obtain a Protected Area Permit before coming to India by directly applying at the Indian Mission in their country.

b) Submit an online application through the e-FRRO portal (Immigration, Visa, Foreigner Registration &amp; Tracking) to enter the Protected Area after arriving in India.

The application will be reviewed by FRRO Kolkata, responsible for the North Eastern States. Once accepted, the application will be forwarded to the relevant FRO (District Superintendent of Police).

After examining the application, the designated FRO will provide an online recommendation to FRRO Kolkata, which will then email the approval letter to the applicant.

Upon entering the Protected Area, the foreigner must self-register on the portal within 24 hours from the time of entry.

If staying at a hotel, the hotel must complete the C-Form entry on the portal within 24 hours of the foreigner's check-in to assist the FRO in tracking the foreigner’s presence.

Since the online Protected Area Permit (PAP) system is still in its early stages, it is challenging to clearly understand the procedures and the time required for issuing PAPs. For example, a Japanese national, Tetsuo Yamaguchi, applied for a PAP on January 22, 2025, and his application was approved on January 23, 2025, valid from January 23 to January 29, 2025. In this instance, the Foreigners Registration Officer (FRO) in Mizoram was not directed to conduct the necessary verification, and the permit was issued directly by the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Kolkata.

**Manpower Situation:**

The Senior Superintendent of Police (Sr. SP) of CID (SB) is appointed as the State Foreigners Registration Officer. This unit, through the Foreigners Registration Branch, is responsible for executing the Immigration, Visa, Foreigners Registration &amp; Tracking (IVFRT) Project. This includes: i) the e-FRRO portal, ii) the District Police Module, iii) the Nationality Status Verification Portal, and iv) the C-Form/S-Form Portal. Additionally, this branch is managing the implementation of the Passport Seva Project Portal with only eight police personnel of various ranks. Given the severe manpower shortage described above, it is believed that additional staff will be necessary for the nodal unit, i.e., the FRO and Sr. SP, CID (SB), in due course to efficiently perform these functions.

**Actions Taken :**

1. On January 10, 2025, a hands-on training session on utilizing the online Protected Area Permit via the e-FRRO portal was held at the Cyber Forensic-cum-Training Centre in the SP, Aizawl Office. Attendees included representatives from the State Foreigners Registration Office (FRO), District FROs, and SP Security. The resource person for this training was Rochungnunga Hrangchal, Deputy Director of NIC and State Coordinator of IVFRT in Mizoram.

2. A meeting to address issues related to the Protected Area Permit (PAP) took place on January 27, 2025, at 11:00 AM in the office chamber of the Secretary, Home Department, Government of Mizoram. The attendees were:

 - Dingluaia, Deputy Inspector General, CID

 - Dr. Andrew H. Vanlaldika, Additional Secretary, Home Department

 - PC Lalduhthlanga, Joint Secretary (P), Home Department

 - Vanlalfaka Ralte, Senior Superintendent of Police, CID (SB)

 - Rochungnunga Hrangchal, Deputy Director (IT), NIC

 - C. Lalfakmawia, Officer on Special Duty and Under Secretary, Home Department

 - Lalnunmawii Varte, Additional Superintendent of Police, Security

**Penalty for not having PAP Permit :**
