Subject: Assessment of threat perception.

Ref: No:SEC/R-40/2015/329 dt.23.3.2018.

Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, I am submitting herewith the assessment of threat perception in respect of Pi Lucy Lalrinthari, Special Judge, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1985 and Pu Lalramsanga, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Siaha as under :

****Pi Lucy Lalrinthari, Special Judge, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1985****

****Pi Lucy Lalrinthari is currently provided with 1 (one) PSO which is found sufficient for the time being. During the assessment, it has been observed that she did not receive any threat and no intimidation was made or heard from anyone against her. However, in spite of absence of imminent threat, it is suggested that Pi Lucy Lalrinthari, being a female judge may retain 1 (one) PSO for her security as she is dealing with sensitive Criminal Cases.

**Pu Lalramsanga, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Siaha**

****No imminent threat has been perceived against personal security of Pu Lalramsanga. Therefore, due to absence of imminent threat against him, it was observed that Pu Lalramsanga does not require PSO.

 Submitted for kind information and further necessary action please.****

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
