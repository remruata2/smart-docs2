Subject:-  Request for designing Application Software

Sir,

 As you were aware, CID (SB) is an Unit of Mizoram Police whose main function is conducting real time crime investigation and combating Arms/drugs trafficking and underground elements. Moreover, this unit maintained records and documents of various activities within Mizoram since the past several years. It has been decided that the documents be kept in computer database. So, it would be highly appreciated you could design and provide a suitable software application for this office which will enable us to conduct uploading data and mining through our data base.

 Details of the required Software may be communicated later according to convenience.

Yours faithfully,

****(K.LALREMSANGA**)**
