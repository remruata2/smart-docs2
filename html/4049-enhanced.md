4. Recent seizures and movement of detonators and other explosive items.

 As per the record of CID (SB), seizures of explosive substances in the last three months (January 2024 -18th March 2024) in Mizoram are as follows:

1. Sangau PS Case No. 03/24 dated 05.02.2024 u/s 4 Explosive Substances Act 1908/341 IPC r/w 14 Foreigner Act in which 6 boxes (1200 sticks) of Gelatine, 1800 Nos. Detonator and 3750 metres of Detonating fuse were seized.
2. Bawngkawn PS Case No. 53/24 dated 15.02.2024 u/s 5 (a) Explosive Substances Act 1908 in which 165 boxes of Detonator and 993 cm of Detonating fuse were seized.
3. Tipa PS Case No. 1/24 dated 21.02.2024 u/s 5 of Explosive Substances Act 1908 in which 110 sticks of Gelatine, 100 nos. of Detonator and 2.3 metres of Detonating fuse were seized.
4. Ngopa PS Case No. 1/24 dated 26.02.2024 u/s 5 of Explosive Substances Act in which 10 sticks of Gelatine, 10 Nos. of Detonator and 5 feet of Detonating fuse were seized.
5. Sairang PS Case No. 10/24 dated 12.03.2024 u/s 5(a) Explosive Substances Act 1908 in which 252 sticks of Gelatine and 1,000 nos. of Detonator were seized.
6. Lunglei PS Case No. 40/24 dated 16.03.2024 u/s 5(a) Explosive Substances Act 1908 in which 262 sticks of Gelatine were seized by Police.
7. Zokhawthar PS Case No. 26/24 dated 18.03.2024 u/s 5(a) Explosive Substances Act 1908 in which 110 sticks of Gelatine were seized.

In most of the above mentioned cases the consignments are seized by Assam Rifles through its own sources and their destination is not known even after conducting joint interrogations with sister agencies. From the light of interrogation of the arrested accused persons who are mainly the transporters as in the cases of Bawngkawn and Sairang Police Station cases, the persons directing the procurement of the explosive items were not surprisingly arrested or produced at the respective police stations while the transporter had no clue of the destination of the items they are transporting while the unclaimed explosive items in connection with Tipa Police Station case was seized from under a culvert with no local police or civilian witnesses.

In the case of Ngopa and Lunglei cases, the seized explosives are procured or possessed for used in fishing and local stone quarry. The explosive substances seized in connection with Zokhawthar Police Station which was procured from a stone quarry from Zobawk, Lunglei are also learnt to be used for clearing/breaking of stones which block the irrigation system of a paddy field at Parzang Village, Myanmar which was confirmed after contacting the local leaders of Parzang Village.

However, the intended used of the explosive items seized in connection with Sangau Police Station could not be ascertained and the destination of the consignment was Salen Village, Myanmar as per the statements of the accused persons. Thorough enquiry revealed that the explosive substances were procured from M/S Trustwell, Thakthing Veng, Aizawl by Lalsangpuii (60) w/o Lawmzuala of Chawnpui Veng, Aizawl who used the explosive licence of RS Laltlanthangi w/o Patrick VL Finga Sailo of Kolasib, Venglai for procurement of the explosive substances.

Even though pilferages of gelatine sticks along with detonators and detonating fuses for used in informal stone quarries and illegal fishing inside Mizoram cannot be ruled out, recent inputs suggested that transportation of explosive substances in bulk or large quantities in Mizoram for used outside Mizoram is very minimal if not ceased in the past few months.
