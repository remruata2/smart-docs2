These Myanmar Army personnel surrendered themselves to Assam Rifles at Tuisentlang Village.

These 151 (one hundred fifty one) personnel of Myanmar Army along with their arms and ammunition had been transported by the Assam Rifles, the concerned Border Guarding Force to Parva Assam Rifles Camp which served as a temporary holding area for these foreign military personnel.

Further reliable inputs indicated that since 13.12.2023, anticipating military attack from the Arakan Army, personnel of Myanmar Army of several camps in different locations within the operational areas of Arakan Army had fled their camps to reorganize at the above mentioned Mywah/Myuukwa camp 377.

 Lawngtlai District Police has been working in close coordination with the Assam Rifles in this regard and the situation is closely monitored.

 Due to the intense military operations conducted during the past few months by the combined resistance forces of Myanmar against Myanmar Army in several places of Chin State, Myanmar, many Myanmar Army and Police personnel posted and camped near the IMB surrendered themselves to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles at different places. These personnel of Myanmar were evacuated to safety for their return into Myanmar. The lack of proper Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on the issue of surrendering of Myanmar Army personnel or government servant needed a review to devise a strategy on the matter.
