The two apprehended persons do not possess any valid Inner Line Permit (ILP). They had passed Bairabi Police Check Gate by travelling in the forested area on foot. On checking their belongings, no weapon, instrument or any other types of article which could suggest that they are intending to kidnap children were found.
