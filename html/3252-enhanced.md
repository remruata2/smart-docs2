ATOM interfaces with the operator through Asteria’s proprietary MissionControl Software(MCS). The MCSsoftware is a cross-platform graphical user interface application that runs on Windows and Linux operating systems. The MCS receives and displays telemetry data from theATOM autopilotand allows the user to command, control and configure the autopilot.
