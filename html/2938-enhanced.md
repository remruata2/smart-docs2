****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/568

Dated: 29th July, 2019.

 Information has been received that on 26.7.2019 @ 7:00 a.m, 2 (two) organizations, namely Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Coordination Committee (MBDPCC) and Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement (MBIDM) convened a meeting at Naisingpara Community Multipurpose Centre which was chaired by Pu A. Lalramliana, MBDPCC and attended by about 600-700 persons.

 Leaders of the two organizations apprised the meeting about the recently concluded re-identification of Bru Refugees at their camps by Mizoram Government and the demands submitted by Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Forum (MBDPF) to Mizoram Government which have not been implemented by Mizoram Government till date.

 MBPDCC and MBIDM leaders reiterated their various demands to be fulfilled by Mizoram Government before repatriation commence, viz. establishment of Cluster Villages for repatriated Brus, allocation of 5 Hectares each for repatriated families and advance payment of repatriation allowances. Their leaders further stated that inaction of the Mizoram Government caused inconvenience in the repatriation process. They further resolved to collect name-list of persons who refused to report themselves while identification was conducted as well as list of persons who are against repatriation due to non-implementation of their demands. Information received indicated that they have started the exercise.

 Further information received indicated that leaders of MBPDCC and MBIDM are engaged in propaganda dissemination of blaming leaders of MBDPF by alleging them as puppets of Mizoram Government. Their main purpose appears to be weaning away public trust upon the MBDPF leaders.

 The name list collected and prepared by MBPDCC and MBIDM is not yet available at this juncture and the same may be acquired as soon as they completed the drive.
