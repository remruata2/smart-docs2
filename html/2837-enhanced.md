No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/229

Dated: 2nd April, 2019.

 In continuation of our Special Report No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/226 dated 1.4.2019. Central YMA (CYMA) is scheduled to convene a meeting with leaders of 104 (one hundred and four) Aizawl City Branches on 6.4.2019 @ 8:00 p.m at Chanmari YMA Hall, Aizawl. Information received indicated that the meeting was called with a view to explain before the leaders of the City Branches, the purpose of the proposed boycott of the upcoming MP (Lok Sabha) Election, 2019 and organising State-wide Total Bandh w.e.f. 8.4.2019 under the banner of NGOCC and to chalk out the duty deployment for the said Total Bandh.

 Information received indicated that Sub-Hqrs. YMA, Lunglei held a meeting today, i.e. 2.4.2019 @ 3:00 p.m at their office to decide their position in connection with the proposed agitation of the NGOCC. The meeting could not have a clear cut decision and called for a meeting of NGOCC, Lunglei tomorrow, i.e. 3.4.2019 @ 2:00 p.m at SYMA Conference Hall, Lunglei on whose decision they will likely commit themselves. Meanwhile, Pu Vanlalruata, CYMA President has been scheduled to visit Lunglei tomorrow to hold a meeting with leaders of NGOCC, Lunglei.

 Information has been received that All NGOCC, Kolasib held a meeting today @ 3:00 p.m at Sub-Hqrs. YMA Office which was presided over by Pu C. Liankunga, Chairman and attended by 7 (seven) members. The meeting could not reach a definite conclusion and will resume deliberation over the issue tonight @ 7:30 p.m.

 Leaders of Central YMA, viz. Pu Peter Chhakchhuak, Asst. Secretary and Pu Fabian Lalfakawma, Fin. Secretary left Aizawl for Lawngtlai and Siaha today to have a meeting with leaders of Central YLA and MTP in connection with their intended agitation. They are likely to have a meeting with CYLA tonight.

 Further information received indicated that Election Office have already engaged about 30 (thirty) Buses and 85 (eighty five) Maxi Cabs for the upcoming election. The commercial vehicles have not yet received any formal request/letter from NGOCC and have not yet discussed about supporting the NGOCC agitation. Unconfirmed report indicated that they might acquiesce in the decision of NGOCC.

 It may be mentioned that Sub-Hqrs. YMA and other organisations requested by NGOCC will most likely commit themselves to supporting their decision. In such a scenario, the boycott will likely have crippling effect on the preparation for election with election officials and security personnel unable to move due to participation of commercial vehicles in the movement. Moreover, majority of the voters will most likely hesitate to turn out to cast their votes out of respect of the request of the NGOCC.
