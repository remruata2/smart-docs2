Subject: Illegal Crossing of International Border by Officer and Staff of Mizoram Police.

Ref. : No. Ops/SHQ-AZL/541(A)/2014/8810-14 dt. 30.6.2014.

Madam,

 With reference to above, I am forwarding herewith comments on the reported illegal crossing of International border by officers and staff of Mizoram Police submitted by HL.Thangzuala, Addl.SP, CID(SB) for your kind perusal and necessary action please.

 In this regard, I would like to mention that during the whole process of kidnapping episode, I was part and parcel of Rescue Operation Team (Mizoram Police) since I was holding the post of S.P, Mamit District then. There was no question of crossing International boundary by Mizoram Police at the time of the release of 2(two) Mizo drivers namely - 1) Sanglianthanga @ Maliana S/o VL Hmuaka, Mamit Charkawn, and (ii) Lalzamliana S/o Buanga (L) C/o K.Vanlalchhuanga, Zuangtui Muanna Veng, Aizawl on 21.1.2014.

 Subsequently, I took over the charge of S.P, CID(SB) on 5.3.2014 and continued to supervise the rescue operation of ongoing kidnapping case. Ultimately, Shri. Deep Mandal was released on 22.3.2014 by the abductors. As far as rescue operation of hostages is concerned, there was no question of crossing over Indo-Bangladesh border by Mizoram Police as alleged by BSF Authority. It is a fact that there was cordial understanding and co-operation with Shri CP. Saxena, CO 42nd Bn. BSF and his men during the entire process. The allegation leveled against Mizoram Police by BSF Sector Hqrs., Durtlang, Aizawl, Mizoram is rather disgraceful and shocking whereas a cordial relationship has been maintained till date at the level of supervisory officers. This kind of baseless allegation without any evidence is least expected from concerned Authority of BSF.

Enclo. : As above.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
