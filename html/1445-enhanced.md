**1) No. of Bru who had not left Mizoram in the wake of Bru problem in 1997-1998.**

****Bru Population of Mizoram in 1997 was approximately 30,000. As per their tradition, Brus did not live in permanent villages, always shifting after 2/3 years in a group of around 10/30 houses to other locations. Because of this, their actual village of origin is difficult to track back. Moreover, there is no accurate data on how many families/individuals left Mizoram in the wake of violent incident of 1997.

  The Brus who left Mizoram in 1997-1998 were 16,000 (approx.) and those who remained in Mizoram and did not leave Mizoram in 1997-1998 were 15,000 (approx.).

  At the same time, a number of Brus have returned to Mizoram on their own volition after they fled Mizoram.
