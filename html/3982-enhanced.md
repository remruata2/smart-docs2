No. MSB/CB/B-19(A)/    Dated Aizawl, the April, 2025

To 

 The Under Secretary

 to the Government of Mizoram,

 Home Department.

Subject:  Assessment report of threat perception.

Sir,

 Kindly refer to your letter No.D.32019/1/2024-HMS dated 21.03.2025, I am submitting herewith assessment report of threat perception in respect of Pu Lalrinawma, IRS (Rtd), Vice-Chairman, Mizoram State Project Monitoring Committee (MSPMC) as follows.

 As per assessment, it is learnt that so far, Pu Lalrinawma had not come across any direct threat from any contractors or individuals in the execution of his duties and responsibilities. However, it is to be mentioned that as the committee (i.e. MSPMC) is tasked with monitoring of project works which are generally executed by elites of the society and influential individuals having strong political affiliation and networks, frustration and violence arising out of negative remarks by the monitoring team cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the monitoring team had inspected over, 50 projects throughout Mizoram some of which are located at secluded and remote areas. The reports often reflected substandard works and also censured several contractors.

 In view of the above circumstances, it is recommended that PSO/PSOs may be provided to Pu Lalrinawma, Vice-Chairman, MSPMC in order to ensure his safety and security to enable him to discharge his duties and responsibilities efficiently.

 Submitted for favour of your kind perusal and further necessary action please.

Yours faithfully,

**(VANLALFAKA RALTE)**
