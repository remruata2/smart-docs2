|  1 |  Inter State Coordination Mechanisms to set up for synergy in Counter-Insurgency operations |  The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful. Although peaceful, Mizoram is surrounded by countries and states which are having many disturbances with respect to insurgency and terrorism.  Mizoram itself experienced low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. In the North, Manipur based insurgent group, HPC(D) is currently undergoing Peace Dialogue with the State Government which has shown positive direction. As for the North-Western region, the Bru insurgency has been contained to a great extend so much so that this insurgent Group has become more or less a group of Bandits/Dacoits without any definite demand or objectives.  Having International Borders with Myanmar, the Southern Districts are often affected by insurgencies of Myanmar in the form of refugees fleeing the conflict between insurgent group i.e, Arakan Army (AA) and Myanmar Army (MA) and recently, injured militants seeking medical treatment inside Mizoram.  As is the case, for the purpose of appointing Nodal officer for Counter Insurgency operations for the state of Mizoram, IGP (Hqrs.), PHQ may be please nominated with the following SsP as Co-opted members - 1) SP, Aizawl District. 2) SP Mamit District 3) SP Lawngtlai District.  |
|  2 |  Developing institutions for specialized training of Police in Counter-Insurgency operations |  It is unlikely that the State is able to set-up a separate Institution for Counter Insurgency Operation Training. As such, maximum number of personnel from the State Police may be nominated for Counter Insurgency Training at CIJWS, Vairengte which is located within the state of Mizoram itself.  |
|  3 |  Training of Police for improving investigative skills/basic policing |  In this regard, in-service trainings covering different aspects of Policing have been conducted on a regular basis in different Units/Organisations of Mizoram Police wherein Experts/Resource persons/Experienced officers have been outsourced to impart trainings, etc.  |
