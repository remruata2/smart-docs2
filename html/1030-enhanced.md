The HPC-D intensified their criminal activities since early January 2012 by interfering in the V/C election for which State Election Commission was compelled to postpone election for V/C of 13 (thirteen) villages within Aizawl District and 2 (two) other from Kolasib District. Besides, the HPC-D forcibly dissolved as many as 37 (thirty seven) YMA Branches within their demand areas. They also collected force donation from VC’s, Govt, Employees and Contractors within their demand areas which draw the attention of the Govt. resorting in the arrest of its top 3 (three) leaders viz.2 (two) armed wing leaders S/S Army Chief Ropuia and S/S Dy. Army Chief Biaknunga at Silchar Airport on 10.6.2012 and H. Zosangbera, Chairman at IGI Airport, New Delhi on 17.7.2012. The 3 (three) leaders had been kept under judicial custody. S/S Army Chief Lalropuia was released on bail on 21.11.2012 on medical ground. Thereafter other 2 (two) were also released on bail on 6.2.2013.   The Government of Mizoram, so far, had 2 (two) rounds of peace talk with the HPC(D). The first round of talk was held on 11.11.2010 at State Guest House, Aizawl in which Suspension of Operation (SoO) was signed for a period of 6 (six) months w.e.f. 11.11.2010   The second round of talk was held on 31.1.2013 at State Guest House and SoO was signed for a period of 6 (six) months w.e.f. 31.1.2013 which may be extended by mutual consent.  The Govt. of Mizoram and the HPC(D) had a political talks at Conference Hall, Tourist Lodge, Chaltlang, Aizawl on 18th July 2013. The GoM side was led by Lalbiakzama, Jt. Secretary, GoM, Home Deptt., Ramthlengliana, SP CID(SB), Lalchungnunga, Addl DC, Aizawl district, Lalhriatpuia, Dy.Secretary(Home), David H. Lalthangliana, OSD(Home), Laltanpuia Sailo, Inspr. of Police(interpreter). The HPC(D) delegates was led by LT Hmar, Working Chairman HPC(D), Lalchhanhima, Council Member HPC(D), Lalthalien(delegate), Joseph R.Hmar(delegate), Lalmuanpuia Punte(spokesperson), Rohringa(delegate) and Lalremruata Varte(delegate).  Lalbiakzama, designated team leader representing the GoM presided the meeting. He welcomed and thanked the HPC(D) delegates for attending the dialogue and also appreciated the efforts of the HPC(D) in finding an amicable solution to the problems of the Hmar people in Mizoram.  LT. Hmar, working Chairman HPC(D) submitted the memorandum of the HPC(D) that was addressed to the Chief Minister of Mizoram. The same memorandum was also addressed to the GoM, the Union Home Minister and Jt. Secretary (North East), Govt. of India.  The HPC(D) memorandum termed the July 27, 1994 Memorandum of Settlement(MoS)/Peace Accord that was signed between the GoM and the HPC a hollow political instrument; and not accepted by the HPC(D). 19 years after signing of the MoS, it has proved to the world that the document holds no water and does not stand to fulfill the aspirations of the Hmar people to secure their political future.  In pursuance of the unfinished agenda of the Hmar people, the HPC(D) is committed to find a lasting, dignified and acceptable political solution to the Hmar's aspirations with the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council in the State of Mizoram within the scope of the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. This will be of mutual benefit and based on the long term interest of both the Sinlung originated Hmar peoples and the GoM.  The HPC(D) remain fully and firmly committed not to seek separation from Mizoram but rather seek to find a permanent solution to the protracted Hmar issue in Mizoram, which is compatible with the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India. The HPC(D) firmly believes that to protect Hmar identity, culture, tradition, language, land, resources and to enhance political development and democratic decentralization in Mizoram, the only pragmatic option lies in the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council.  HOC(D) advocates a long term solution that addresses and ends the political marginalization suffered by the Hmar people in Mizoram. It also believes that no solution will lead to enduring peace if it is devoid of political justice and political will and it would not be just if it does not promote and enhance the political aspirations of the Hmar peoples.  The HPC(D) demands that the Union Government of India and the Government of Mizoram make sincere, committed and concerted efforts to fulfill the aspirations of the Hmar peoples. The unfinished agenda should be politically settled in accordance with the Constitution of India with the following objectives:   1. To initiate tripartite dialogue involving the Govt. of India, Govt. of Mizoram and the Hmar Peoples Convention-Democratic for the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council within the State of Mizoram.   2. To provide constitutional safeguards and protection to the Autonomous body as under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.   In the course of the dialogue, the issue of further extension of SoS which is due to expire in July 2013 was raised by Team Leader representing the GoM. The HPC(D) leaders firmly maintains its stands that any furhther extension of SoO should be intricately linked with fixation of definite timeline for political dialogue within the month of July 2013. The talks met a stalemate as it was submitted by the HPC(D) delegates that the issue of further extension of SoO also require prior consultation and decision of the HPC(D) council.  The HPC(D) strongly felt that extension of SoO in Mizoram has no meaning if the prospect for a meaningful political dialogue is not put in place. The democratic interests and aspirations of the Hmar people should not be down played by a negligent and irresponsible delay tactics. The Hmar's aspirations is to justly secure the Constitutional promises, which otherwise has marginalized us.  |
