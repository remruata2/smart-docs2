|  | **Remarks** | **:** | **This armed outfit seem to be not a well organised group like other insurgent groups of the North East and is more likely to be armed gang. They used to collect so-called donation in their operational areas at the rate of Rs.100/- from Bru families and Rs.300/- from non-Bru families annually. Money collected were used for purchasing arms and ammunitions reportedly from Shillong. Even though the kidnapping on 6.6.2011 for ransom was a failure, they might repeat the act in future.** |
