ALP :

 The**Arakan LiberationParty**is aRakhinepolitical partyinMyanmar(Burma). The party has an armed wing, theArakan Liberation Army(ALA), which has 60–100 personnel. The ALA signed a ceasefire agreement with thegovernment of Myanmaron 5 April 2012.

****1968–69[edit]****

 The Arakan Liberation Party was founded on 9 April 1967, along with its armed wing, the Arakan Liberation Army, with the help of theKaren National Union(KNU). On 26 November 1968, Khai Ray Khai, a member of the party's central committee, along with nine other associates, were arrested atSittwe, the capital ofRakhine State, by Burmese authorities. On 20 December 1968 Khaing Soe Naing, the party's General Secretary, was arrested by Burmese authorities at Rathedaung Township, in Rakhine State. Following those arrests, several more ALP members were also arrested on different charges, and the party dissolved. The party has accused the government of torturing its imprisoned members.[3]

****1971–77[edit]****

 Between 1971 and 1972, former political prisoners from the ALP were released on amnesty. As soon as Khaing Moe Lunn, a former ALP member, was released, he departed to Komura to meet with KNU leaders in order to re-establish the ALP and ALA. From 1973 to 1974, the ALP was re-established with help from the KNU, and 300 fighters were recruited and trained by the ALA, with Khaing as the President of the ALP and Commander in Chief of the ALA.[3]

Between April and May 1977, 120 insurgents led by Khiang Moe Lunn engaged withIndian governmentforces andBurmese forcesat theIndian-Myanmarborder. 10 ALA insurgents were killed, including Khaing Moe Lunn, over 70 were arrested by Indian and Burmese authorities, and 40 were disarmed and arrested by theBurmese Army. An additional 20 went missing during retreats from government forces. 30 of the arrested wereexecuted, and 55 others were charged withtreasonunder Article 122 of the then constitution. 11 of those charged with treason weresentenced to death, and the rest tolife imprisonment. The party ceased once again after the ALA's defeat.[

****1980–present[edit]****

 In 1980, all ALP and ALA prisoners were released on amnesty. In 1981, the ALP and ALA were once again established, now under the leadership of Khai Ray Khai, and was once again assisted by the KNU. The ALP is presently allied with the KNU, along with theNational Democratic Front(NDF), the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), and the National Council of the Union of Burma (NCUB).

The party was founded on 13 January 2014 and registered with theelection commissionon 6 March 2014.[5][6][7]The chairman of the ANP is Dr.Aye Maung.

****History[edit]****

 On 17 June 2013, TheRakhine Nationalities Development Party(RNDP), led by Dr. Aye Maung, and theArakan League for Democracy(ALD), led byAye Thar Aung, signed an agreement to merge under the name of the Arakan National Party after more than eight months of negotiations.[8]

 In the2015 general election, the party contested 63 seats inRakhine State,Chin State,Ayeyarwady Region, andYangon Region. The party won 10 seats in theAmyotha Hluttaw, 12 in thePyithu Hluttaw, 22 in theRakhine State Hluttaw, and one party member became anEthnic Affairs Minister.[7][9][10][11][12]

 On 8 January 2017, former leaders of the ALD announced that they were splitting from the ANP and were re-registering with the Union Election Commission for the2020 elections, citing internal issues and RNDP dominance in the ANP as the reasons for the split.[13][14]

On 27 November 2017, Dr. Aye Maung tendered his resignation from the party as chairman and member, citing persistent conflicts within the top ranks of the party.[15]

****Rakhine State**(/rÉ™ËˆkaÉªn/;Burmese:á€›á€á€­á€¯á€„á€ºá€•á€¼á€Šá€ºá€”á€šá€º;MLCTS:_ra.hkuing pranynay_,Rakhine pronunciation[É¹É™kÊ°àiÉ´ pÉ¹ènè];Burmese pronunciation:[jÉ™kÊ°àiÉ´ pjìnÉ›Ì€]; formerly**Arakan**) is astateinMyanmar(Burma). Situated on the western coast, it is bordered byChin Stateto the north,Magway Region,Bago RegionandAyeyarwady Regionto the east, theBay of Bengalto the west, and theChittagong DivisionofBangladeshto the northwest. It is located approximately between latitudes 17°30' north and 21°30' north and east longitudes 92°10' east and 94°50' east. TheArakan Mountains, rising to 3,063 metres (10,049ft) atVictoria Peak, separate Rakhine State from central Burma. Off the coast of Rakhine State there are some fairly large islands such asChedubaandMyingun Island. Rakhine State has an area of 36,762 square kilometres (14,194sqmi) and its capital isSittwe.[2]**

The term_Rakhine_is believed to have been derived from thePaliword_Rakkhapura_(Sanskrit Raksapura), meaning "Land ofOgres" (Rakshas), possibly a pejorative referring to the originalNegrito[3]Australoid inhabitants. The Pali word "Rakkhapura" ("Rakkhita") means "land of the people of Rakhasa" (also_Rakkha_,_Rakhaing_). They were given this name in honour of their preservation of their national heritage and ethics or morality.[4]The word Rakhine means, "one who maintains his own race"[5]In theRakhine language, the land is called_Rakhinepray_, the ethnicRakhineare called_Rakhinetha_.

Arakan, used in British colonial times, is believed to be aPortuguesecorruption of the word Rakhine that is still popularly used in English. Many English language users[note 1]eschew the name changes promulgated by the military government.

The history of the region of Arakan (now renamed Rakhine) State can be roughly divided into seven parts. The first four divisions and the periods are based on the location of the centre of power of the main independent Rakhine-dominated polities in the northern Rakhine region, especially along the Kaladan River. Thus, the history is divided into theDhanyawadi,Waithali,LaymroandMrauk U. Mrauk U was conquered by theKonbaung dynastyof Burma in 1784–85, after which Rakhine became part of the Konbaung kingdom of Burma. In 1824, the first Anglo-Burmese war erupted and in 1826, Rakhine (alongsideTanintharyi) was ceded to the British as reparation by the Burmese to the British. Rakhine thus became part of the province of Burma of British India. In 1948, Burma was given independence and Rakhine became part (colony) of the new federal republic.

Based on Rakhine oral histories and inscriptions in certain temples, the history of the Rakhine region dates back nearly five thousand years.[_citation needed_]The Rakhine people trace their societal history back to as far as 3325 BCE and have given a lineal succession of 227 native monarchs and princes down to the last ruler in 1784. They also describe their territory of including, in varying points of time, the regions ofAva, theIrrawaddy Delta, the port town ofThanlyin(Syriam) and parts of eastern Bengal. However, the expanse of the successive Rakhine kingdoms does not exactly corroborate with certain known historical documentation.[_citation needed_]

According to Rakhine legend, the first recorded kingdom arose, centred around the northern town ofDhanyawadiin the 34th century BCE and lasted until 327 CE. Rakhine documents and inscriptions state that the famedMahamuni Buddha imagewas cast in Dhanyawady in around 554 BCE when the Buddha visited the kingdom. After the fall of Dhanyawadi in the 4th century CE, the centre of power shifted to a new dynasty based in the town of Waithali. The Waithali kingdom ruled the regions of Rakhine from the middle of the 4th century to 818 CE. The period is seen as the classical period of Rakhine culture, architecture and Buddhism, as the Waithali period left behind more archaeological remains compared to its predecessor. A new dynasty emerged in four towns along the Laymro river as Waithali waned in influence, and ushered in the Lemro period, where four principal towns served as successive capitals.[_citation needed_]

The finalKingdom of Mrauk Uwas founded in 1429 byMin Saw Mon. It is seen by the Rakhine people as the golden age of their history, as Mrauk U served as a commercially important port and base of power in the Bay of Bengal region and involved in extensive maritime trade with Arabia and Europe.[_citation needed_]The country steadily declined from the 17th century onwards after the loss ofChittagongto theMughal Empirein 1666. Internal instability, rebellion and dethroning of kings were very common. The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness in Asia, gained a temporary establishment in Arakans.[6][7][8]

****Non-Arakanese rule****

On 2 January 1785, the internally divided kingdom fell to invading forces from Konbaung, Burma. The Mahamuni image was taken away by the Burmese as war loot. Thus, an expansionist Burma came into direct territorial contact with territories of the British East India Company, which set the stage for future flaring of hostility. Various geopolitical issues gave rise to the FirstAnglo-Burmese War(1824–26). As the image of Mahamuni had been taken as war loot by the Burmese, this time the huge bell of the temple was taken by theBritish Armyand awarded to a soldier, Bhim Singh, a Risaldar in East India Company's 2nd Division of the British, for his bravery. This inscribed huge bell is still installed in a Mandir at village Nadrai nearKasganjtown in present-day Kanshiram Nagar District of Utter Pradesh India. In theTreaty of Yandabo(1826), which ended hostilities, Burma was forced to cede Arakan alongsideTanintharyi(Tenasserim) toBritish India. The British made Akyab (now Sittwe) the capital of Arakan. Later, Arakan became part of the province of Burma of the British Indian Empire, and then part of British Burma when Burma was made into a separate crown colony. Arakan was administratively divided into three districts along traditional divisions during the Mrauk U period

****1940 onwards[edit]****

Rakhine (Arakan) was the site of many battles during the Second World War, most notably theArakan Campaign 1942–43and theBattle of Ramree Island. Arakan became part of the newly independent Union of Burma in 1948 and the three districts became Arakan Division. From the 1950s, there was a growing movement forsecessionand restoration of Arakan independence. In part to appease this sentiment, in 1974, the socialist government under GeneralNe Winconstituted Rakhine State from Arakan Division giving at least nominal acknowledgment of the regional majority of theRakhine people.

****2012 Rakhine State riots**[edit]**

_Main article:____2012 Rakhine State riots_

The 2012 Rakhine State riots were a series of conflicts between Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhines who are majority in the Rakhine State. Before the riots, there were widespread and strongly held fears circulating among Buddhist Rakhines that they would soon become a minority in their ancestral state.[11]The riots finally came after weeks of sectarian disputes including the death of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines and murder of a Rakhine by Rohingyas.[12][13]From both sides, whole villages were "decimated".[13][14]According to the Burmese authorities, the violence, between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and up to 140,000 people have been displaced.[15][16]The government has responded by imposing curfews and by deploying troops in the region. On 10 June 2012, astate of emergencywas declared in Rakhine, allowing the military to participate in the administration of the region.[17][18]Rohingya NGOs overseas have accused the Burmese army and police of targeting Rohingya Muslims through arrests and participating in violence.[15][19]However, an in-depth research conducted by the International Crisis Group shows that both communities are grateful for the protection provided by the military.[20]A number of monks' organisations have taken measures to block aid from NGOs that help Rohingyas.[21]In July 2012, the Burmese Government did not include the Rohingya minority group in the census—classified asstatelessBengali Muslimsfrom Bangladesh since 1982.[22]About 140,000 Rohingya in Burma remain confined in IDP camps.[23]

Rakhine State (formerly known as Arakan Province), like many parts of Burma, has a diverse ethnic population. Official Burmese figures state Rakhine State's population as 3,118,963.[24]

The ethnicRakhinemake up the majority, followed by a considerable population ofRohingyaMuslims.[25][26]The Rakhine reside mainly in the lowland valleys as well asRamreeandManaung(Cheduba) islands. A number of other ethnic minorities like theThet,Kamein,Chin,Mro,Chakma,Khami,Dainet,Bengali HinduandMaramagriinhabit mainly in the hill regions of the state. Most of the Tibeto-Burmans living in Rakhine State adhere to Theravada Buddhism. Even the Chin, who are usually related with Protestant Christianity or Animism, of Rakhine state adhere to Buddhism due to the cultural influence of the Rakhine people. Muslims constitute more than 80–96% of the population near the border withBangladeshand the coastal areas.

Few roads cross theArakan Mountainsfrom central Burma to Rakhine State. The three highways that do are theAnntoMunbra(Minbyain Burmese pronunciation) road in central Rakhine,[29]theTounguptoPamtaungroad in south central Rakhine,[29]and theGwatoNgathaingchaungroad in far southern Rakhine.[29][30][31]Air travel still is the usual mode of travel fromYangonandMandalayto Sittwe andNgapali, the popular beach resort. Only in 1996 was a highway from Sittwe to the mainland constructed. The state still does not have a rail line (althoughMyanmar Railwayshas announced a 480-km rail extension to Sittwe from Pathein via Ponnagyun-Kyauttaw-Mrauk U-Minbya-Ann).[32]

**The**2012 Rakhine State riots**were a series of conflicts primarily between ethnicRakhineBuddhists andRohingyaMuslims in northernRakhine State,Myanmar, though by October Muslims of all ethnicities had begun to be targeted.[5][6][7]The riots finally came after weeks of sectarian disputes including a gang rape and murder of a Rakhine woman by Rohingyas and killing of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines.[8]On 8 June 2012, Rohingyas started to burn Rakhine's Buddhist and other ethnic houses after returning from Friday's prayers in Maungdaw township. More than a dozen residents were killed in this riot by Rohingya Muslims.[9]State of emergencywas declared in Rakhine, allowing military to participate in administration of the region.[10][11]As of 22 August, officially there had been 88 casualties– 57 Muslims and 31 Buddhists.[1]An estimated 90,000 people were displaced by the violence.[12][13]About 2,528 houses were burned; of those, 1,336 belonged to Rohingyas and 1,192 belonged to Rakhines.[14]**

Rohingya NGOs have accused the Burmese army and police of playing a role in targeting Rohingya through mass arrests and arbitrary violence[15]though an in-depth research by the International Crisis Group reported that members of both communities were grateful for the protection provided by the military.[16]While the government response was praised by theUnited StatesandEuropean Union,[17][18]NGOs were more critical, citing discrimination of Rohingyas by the previous military government.[17]TheUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesand severalhuman rightsgroups rejected the PresidentThein Sein's proposal to resettle the Rohingya abroad.[19][20]

Fighting broke out again in October, resulting in at least 80 deaths, the displacement of more than 20,000 people, and the burning of thousands of homes. Rohingyas are not allowed to leave their settlements, officially due to security concerns, and are the subject of a campaign of commercial boycott led by Buddhist monks.[21]

Sectarian clashes occur sporadically in Rakhine State, often between the BuddhistRakhine peoplewho are majority in the southern part, andRohingyaMuslims who are majority in the north.[22]Before the riots, there were widespread and strongly held fears circulating among Buddhist Rakhines that they would soon become a minority in their ancestral state, and not just the northern part, which has long become a Muslim majority.Rohingyas migrated to Burma fromBengal, today'sBangladeshprimarily before and during the period of British rule,[23][24][25]and to a lesser extent, after the Burmese independence in 1948 andBangladesh Liberation Warin 1971.[22][22][26][27]Rakhines believed that many immigrants arrived even after the 1980s. The Burmese government classifies the Rohingya as "immigrants" to Burma, and thus not eligible for citizenship. Due to their lack of citizenship, they were previously subject to restrictions on government education, officially recognised marriages, and along with ethnic Rakhines, endured forced labour under the military government.[28][29]

On the evening of 28 May, three Muslim youths apparently robbed, raped and murdered an ethnic Rakhine woman, Ma Thida Htwe, near her village Tha Pri Chaung when she was returning home from Kyauk Ni Maw Village of Rambree township.[30]The government doctor who had signed the post-mortem report had however said there was no trace of rape on her murdered body. In addition, one of the accused actually was a Buddhist.[31]

The locals claim the culprits to have been Rohingya Muslims. The police arrested three suspects and sent them toYanbye townshipjail.[32]On 3 June,[33]a mob attacked a bus inTaungup, apparently mistakenly believing those responsible for the murder were on board.[34]Ten Muslims were killed in the attack,[35]prompting protests by Burmese Muslims in the commercial capital, Yangon. The government responded by appointing a minister and a senior police chief to head an investigation committee. The committee was ordered to find out "cause and instigation of the incident" and to pursue legal action.[36]As of 2 July 30 people had been arrested over the killing of the Muslims.[37]

****8 June: Initial attacks[edit]****

Despite increased security measures, at 3:50pm 8 June, a large mob of Rakhine ignited several houses in Bohmu Village,MaungdawTownship where 80% of the population is Rohingya Muslims. Telephone lines were also damaged.[39]By the evening, Hmuu Zaw, a high-ranking officer, reported that the security forces were protecting 14 burnt villages inMaungdawtownship. Around 5:30, the forces were authorised to usedeadly forcebut they fired mostly warning shots according to local media.[39][40]Soon afterward, authorities declared that the situation in Maungdaw Township had been stabilised. However, three villages of southern Maungdaw were torched in early evening. At 9 o'clock, the government imposed curfew in Maungdaw, and forbidding any gathering of more than five persons in public area. An hour later, the rioters had a police outpost in Khayay Mying Village surrounded. The police fired warning shots to disperse them.[40]At 10 o'clock, armed forces had taken positions in Maungdaw. Five people had been confirmed killed as of 8 June.[41]

****9 June: Riots spread[edit]****

On the morning of 9 June, five army battalions arrived to reinforce the existing security forces. Government set up refugee camps for those whose houses had been burned. Government reports stated that Relief and Resettlement Ministry and Ministry of Defense had distributed 3.3 tons of supplies and 2 tons of clothes respectively.[42]

Despite increased security presence, the riots continued unabated. Security forces successfully prevented rioters' attempt to torch five quarters of Maungdaw. However, Rakhine villagers fromButhidaung Township(where 90 percent of people are Rohingya Muslims) arrived at refugee camps after their houses had been razed by Muslims. Soon after, soldiers took positions and anti-riot police patrolled in the township. The Muslim rioters marched to Sittwe and burned down three houses in Mingan quarter. An official report stated that at least 7 people had been killed, one hostel, 17 shops and over 494 houses had been destroyed as of 9 June.[42]

An official report stated that at least 7 people had been killed, one hostel, 17 shops and over 494 houses had been destroyed as of 9 June.[42]

****10 June: State of emergency[edit]****

On 10 June, a state of emergency was declared across Rakhine.[22]According to state TV, the order was given in response to "unrest and terrorist attacks" and "intended to restore security and stability to the people immediately."[22]PresidentThein Seinadded that further unrest could threaten the country's moves toward democracy.[43]It was the first time that the current government used the provision. It instigated martial law, giving the military administrative control of the region.[22]The move was criticised byHuman Rights Watch, who accused the government of handing control over to a military which had historically brutalised people in the region.[43][44]Some ethnic Rakhine burned Rohingya houses in Bohmu village in retaliation.[45]Over five thousand people were residing at refugee camps by 10 June.[46]Many of the refugees fled toSittweto escape the rioting, overwhelming local officials.[43]

****12–14 June[edit]****

On 12 June, more buildings were set ablaze in Sittwe as many residents throughout Rakhine were relocated.[47]"Smoke is billowing from many directions and we are scared," said one ethnic Rakhine resident. "The government should send in more security forces to protect [our] communities."[44]An unnamed government official put the death toll at 25 to date.[44]

The number of casualties were officially revised to 21 on 13 June.[48]A top United Nations envoy visited the region affected by the riots. "We're here to observe and assess how we can continue to provide support to Rakhine [State]," said Ashok Nigam, UN humanitarian coordinator.[48]The envoy later remarked that army appeared to have restored order to the region.[13]

Meanwhile, Bangladeshi authorities continued to turn away refugees, denying another 140 people entry into Bangladesh. To date at least 15 boats and up to 1,500 total refugees had been turned away.[48]Dipu Moni, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, said at a news conference in the capital, Dhaka, that Bangladesh did not have the capacity to accept refugees because the impoverished country’s resources already are strained.[49]The UN called on Bangladesh to reconsider.[50]

On 14 June, the situation appeared calm as casualty figures were updated to 29 deaths– 16 Muslim and 13 Buddhists according to Myanmar authorities.[13]The government also estimated 2,500 homes had been destroyed and 30,000 people displaced by the violence. Thirty-seven camps across Rakhine housed the refugees.[13]Opposition leaderAung San Suu Kyiwarned that violence would continue unless "the rule of law" was restored.[13]

****15–28 June: Fatality figures update and arrest of UN workers[edit]****

As of 28 June, casualty figures were updated to 80 deaths and estimated 90,000 people were displaced and taking refuge in temporary camps according to official reports.[51]Hundreds of Rohingyas fled across the border to Bangladesh, though many were forced back to Burma. Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh also claimed that the Burmese army and police shot groups of villagers after they started the riot. They stated they feared to return to Burma when Bangladesh rejected them as refugees and asked them to go back home.[15][15]Despite the claims made by NGOs, an in-depth research by the International Crisis Group reported that members of both communities were grateful for protection provided by the military.[16]

TheGovernment of Myanmararrested 10 UNUNHCRworkers and charged three with "stimulating" the riots.[52]António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, visitedYangonand asked for the release of the UN workers which Myanmar's PresidentThein Seinsaid he would not allow but asked if the UN would help to resettle up to 1,000,000 Rohingya Muslims in either refugee camps in Bangladesh or some other country.[52]The UN rejected Thein Sein's proposal.[19]

****October riots[edit]****

Violence between Muslims and Buddhists broke out again in late October.[53][54]According to the Burmese government, more than 80 people were killed, more than 22,000 people were displaced, and more than 4,600 houses burnt.[4]The outburst of fighting brought the total number of displaced since the beginning of the conflict to 100,000.[4]

The violence began in the towns of Min Bya and Mrauk Oo by the Muslims, but spread across the state.[53]Though the majority of Rakhine state's Muslims are Rohingya, Muslims of all ethnicities were reported to be targets of the violence in retaliation.[5][6]Several Muslim groups announced that they would not be celebratingEid al-Adhabecause they felt the government could not protect them.[54]

UN Secretary GeneralBan Ki-Moonissued a statement on 26 October that "the vigilante attacks, targeted threats and extremist rhetoric must be stopped. If this is not done ... the reform and opening up process being currently pursued by the government is likely to be jeopardised."[53]US State DepartmentspokeswomanVictoria Nulandcalled on the Burmese government to halt the violence and allow aid groups unrestricted access.[54]On 27 October, a spokesperson for Thein Sein acknowledged "incidents of whole villages and parts of the towns being burnt down in Rakhine state", after Human Rights Watch released a satellite image showing hundreds of Muslim buildings destroyed inKyaukpyuonRamree Island.[5]The United Nations reported on 28 October that 3,200 more displaced people had fled to refugee camps, with an estimated additional 2,500 still in transit.[55]

In early November,Doctors Without Bordersreported that pamphlets and posters were being distributed in Rakhine State threatening aid workers who treated Muslims, causing almost all of its local staff to quit.[56]

 The Arakan Liberation Party was founded on 9 April 1967, along with its armed wing, the Arakan Liberation Army, with the help of theKaren National Union(KNU). On 26 November 1968, Khai Ray Khai, a member of the party's central committee, along with nine other associates, were arrested atSittwe, the capital ofRakhine State, by Burmese authorities. On 20 December 1968 Khaing Soe Naing, the party's General Secretary, was arrested by Burmese authorities at Rathedaung Township, in Rakhine State. Following those arrests, several more ALP members were also arrested on different charges, and the party dissolved. The party has accused the government of torturing its imprisoned members.[3]

****1971–77[edit]****

 Between 1971 and 1972, former political prisoners from the ALP were released on amnesty. As soon as Khaing Moe Lunn, a former ALP member, was released, he departed to Komura to meet with KNU leaders in order to re-establish the ALP and ALA. From 1973 to 1974, the ALP was re-established with help from the KNU, and 300 fighters were recruited and trained by the ALA, with Khaing as the President of the ALP and Commander in Chief of the ALA.[3]

Between April and May 1977, 120 insurgents led by Khiang Moe Lunn engaged withIndian governmentforces andBurmese forcesat theIndian-Myanmarborder. 10 ALA insurgents were killed, including Khaing Moe Lunn, over 70 were arrested by Indian and Burmese authorities, and 40 were disarmed and arrested by theBurmese Army. An additional 20 went missing during retreats from government forces. 30 of the arrested wereexecuted, and 55 others were charged withtreasonunder Article 122 of the then constitution. 11 of those charged with treason weresentenced to death, and the rest tolife imprisonment. The party ceased once again after the ALA's defeat.[

****1980–present[edit]****

 In 1980, all ALP and ALA prisoners were released on amnesty. In 1981, the ALP and ALA were once again established, now under the leadership of Khai Ray Khai, and was once again assisted by the KNU. The ALP is presently allied with the KNU, along with theNational Democratic Front(NDF), the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), and the National Council of the Union of Burma (NCUB).

The party was founded on 13 January 2014 and registered with theelection commissionon 6 March 2014.[5][6][7]The chairman of the ANP is Dr.Aye Maung.

****History[edit]****

 On 17 June 2013, TheRakhine Nationalities Development Party(RNDP), led by Dr. Aye Maung, and theArakan League for Democracy(ALD), led byAye Thar Aung, signed an agreement to merge under the name of the Arakan National Party after more than eight months of negotiations.[8]

 In the2015 general election, the party contested 63 seats inRakhine State,Chin State,Ayeyarwady Region, andYangon Region. The party won 10 seats in theAmyotha Hluttaw, 12 in thePyithu Hluttaw, 22 in theRakhine State Hluttaw, and one party member became anEthnic Affairs Minister.[7][9][10][11][12]

 On 8 January 2017, former leaders of the ALD announced that they were splitting from the ANP and were re-registering with the Union Election Commission for the2020 elections, citing internal issues and RNDP dominance in the ANP as the reasons for the split.[13][14]

On 27 November 2017, Dr. Aye Maung tendered his resignation from the party as chairman and member, citing persistent conflicts within the top ranks of the party.[15]

****Rakhine State**(/rÉ™ËˆkaÉªn/;Burmese:á€›á€á€­á€¯á€„á€ºá€•á€¼á€Šá€ºá€”á€šá€º;MLCTS:_ra.hkuing pranynay_,Rakhine pronunciation[É¹É™kÊ°àiÉ´ pÉ¹ènè];Burmese pronunciation:[jÉ™kÊ°àiÉ´ pjìnÉ›Ì€]; formerly**Arakan**) is astateinMyanmar(Burma). Situated on the western coast, it is bordered byChin Stateto the north,Magway Region,Bago RegionandAyeyarwady Regionto the east, theBay of Bengalto the west, and theChittagong DivisionofBangladeshto the northwest. It is located approximately between latitudes 17°30' north and 21°30' north and east longitudes 92°10' east and 94°50' east. TheArakan Mountains, rising to 3,063 metres (10,049ft) atVictoria Peak, separate Rakhine State from central Burma. Off the coast of Rakhine State there are some fairly large islands such asChedubaandMyingun Island. Rakhine State has an area of 36,762 square kilometres (14,194sqmi) and its capital isSittwe.[2]**

The term_Rakhine_is believed to have been derived from thePaliword_Rakkhapura_(Sanskrit Raksapura), meaning "Land ofOgres" (Rakshas), possibly a pejorative referring to the originalNegrito[3]Australoid inhabitants. The Pali word "Rakkhapura" ("Rakkhita") means "land of the people of Rakhasa" (also_Rakkha_,_Rakhaing_). They were given this name in honour of their preservation of their national heritage and ethics or morality.[4]The word Rakhine means, "one who maintains his own race"[5]In theRakhine language, the land is called_Rakhinepray_, the ethnicRakhineare called_Rakhinetha_.

Arakan, used in British colonial times, is believed to be aPortuguesecorruption of the word Rakhine that is still popularly used in English. Many English language users[note 1]eschew the name changes promulgated by the military government.

The history of the region of Arakan (now renamed Rakhine) State can be roughly divided into seven parts. The first four divisions and the periods are based on the location of the centre of power of the main independent Rakhine-dominated polities in the northern Rakhine region, especially along the Kaladan River. Thus, the history is divided into theDhanyawadi,Waithali,LaymroandMrauk U. Mrauk U was conquered by theKonbaung dynastyof Burma in 1784–85, after which Rakhine became part of the Konbaung kingdom of Burma. In 1824, the first Anglo-Burmese war erupted and in 1826, Rakhine (alongsideTanintharyi) was ceded to the British as reparation by the Burmese to the British. Rakhine thus became part of the province of Burma of British India. In 1948, Burma was given independence and Rakhine became part (colony) of the new federal republic.

Based on Rakhine oral histories and inscriptions in certain temples, the history of the Rakhine region dates back nearly five thousand years.[_citation needed_]The Rakhine people trace their societal history back to as far as 3325 BCE and have given a lineal succession of 227 native monarchs and princes down to the last ruler in 1784. They also describe their territory of including, in varying points of time, the regions ofAva, theIrrawaddy Delta, the port town ofThanlyin(Syriam) and parts of eastern Bengal. However, the expanse of the successive Rakhine kingdoms does not exactly corroborate with certain known historical documentation.[_citation needed_]

According to Rakhine legend, the first recorded kingdom arose, centred around the northern town ofDhanyawadiin the 34th century BCE and lasted until 327 CE. Rakhine documents and inscriptions state that the famedMahamuni Buddha imagewas cast in Dhanyawady in around 554 BCE when the Buddha visited the kingdom. After the fall of Dhanyawadi in the 4th century CE, the centre of power shifted to a new dynasty based in the town of Waithali. The Waithali kingdom ruled the regions of Rakhine from the middle of the 4th century to 818 CE. The period is seen as the classical period of Rakhine culture, architecture and Buddhism, as the Waithali period left behind more archaeological remains compared to its predecessor. A new dynasty emerged in four towns along the Laymro river as Waithali waned in influence, and ushered in the Lemro period, where four principal towns served as successive capitals.[_citation needed_]

The finalKingdom of Mrauk Uwas founded in 1429 byMin Saw Mon. It is seen by the Rakhine people as the golden age of their history, as Mrauk U served as a commercially important port and base of power in the Bay of Bengal region and involved in extensive maritime trade with Arabia and Europe.[_citation needed_]The country steadily declined from the 17th century onwards after the loss ofChittagongto theMughal Empirein 1666. Internal instability, rebellion and dethroning of kings were very common. The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness in Asia, gained a temporary establishment in Arakans.[6][7][8]

****Non-Arakanese rule****

On 2 January 1785, the internally divided kingdom fell to invading forces from Konbaung, Burma. The Mahamuni image was taken away by the Burmese as war loot. Thus, an expansionist Burma came into direct territorial contact with territories of the British East India Company, which set the stage for future flaring of hostility. Various geopolitical issues gave rise to the FirstAnglo-Burmese War(1824–26). As the image of Mahamuni had been taken as war loot by the Burmese, this time the huge bell of the temple was taken by theBritish Armyand awarded to a soldier, Bhim Singh, a Risaldar in East India Company's 2nd Division of the British, for his bravery. This inscribed huge bell is still installed in a Mandir at village Nadrai nearKasganjtown in present-day Kanshiram Nagar District of Utter Pradesh India. In theTreaty of Yandabo(1826), which ended hostilities, Burma was forced to cede Arakan alongsideTanintharyi(Tenasserim) toBritish India. The British made Akyab (now Sittwe) the capital of Arakan. Later, Arakan became part of the province of Burma of the British Indian Empire, and then part of British Burma when Burma was made into a separate crown colony. Arakan was administratively divided into three districts along traditional divisions during the Mrauk U period

****1940 onwards[edit]****

Rakhine (Arakan) was the site of many battles during the Second World War, most notably theArakan Campaign 1942–43and theBattle of Ramree Island. Arakan became part of the newly independent Union of Burma in 1948 and the three districts became Arakan Division. From the 1950s, there was a growing movement forsecessionand restoration of Arakan independence. In part to appease this sentiment, in 1974, the socialist government under GeneralNe Winconstituted Rakhine State from Arakan Division giving at least nominal acknowledgment of the regional majority of theRakhine people.

****2012 Rakhine State riots**[edit]**

_Main article:____2012 Rakhine State riots_

The 2012 Rakhine State riots were a series of conflicts between Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhines who are majority in the Rakhine State. Before the riots, there were widespread and strongly held fears circulating among Buddhist Rakhines that they would soon become a minority in their ancestral state.[11]The riots finally came after weeks of sectarian disputes including the death of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines and murder of a Rakhine by Rohingyas.[12][13]From both sides, whole villages were "decimated".[13][14]According to the Burmese authorities, the violence, between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and up to 140,000 people have been displaced.[15][16]The government has responded by imposing curfews and by deploying troops in the region. On 10 June 2012, astate of emergencywas declared in Rakhine, allowing the military to participate in the administration of the region.[17][18]Rohingya NGOs overseas have accused the Burmese army and police of targeting Rohingya Muslims through arrests and participating in violence.[15][19]However, an in-depth research conducted by the International Crisis Group shows that both communities are grateful for the protection provided by the military.[20]A number of monks' organisations have taken measures to block aid from NGOs that help Rohingyas.[21]In July 2012, the Burmese Government did not include the Rohingya minority group in the census—classified asstatelessBengali Muslimsfrom Bangladesh since 1982.[22]About 140,000 Rohingya in Burma remain confined in IDP camps.[23]

Rakhine State (formerly known as Arakan Province), like many parts of Burma, has a diverse ethnic population. Official Burmese figures state Rakhine State's population as 3,118,963.[24]

The ethnicRakhinemake up the majority, followed by a considerable population ofRohingyaMuslims.[25][26]The Rakhine reside mainly in the lowland valleys as well asRamreeandManaung(Cheduba) islands. A number of other ethnic minorities like theThet,Kamein,Chin,Mro,Chakma,Khami,Dainet,Bengali HinduandMaramagriinhabit mainly in the hill regions of the state. Most of the Tibeto-Burmans living in Rakhine State adhere to Theravada Buddhism. Even the Chin, who are usually related with Protestant Christianity or Animism, of Rakhine state adhere to Buddhism due to the cultural influence of the Rakhine people. Muslims constitute more than 80–96% of the population near the border withBangladeshand the coastal areas.

Few roads cross theArakan Mountainsfrom central Burma to Rakhine State. The three highways that do are theAnntoMunbra(Minbyain Burmese pronunciation) road in central Rakhine,[29]theTounguptoPamtaungroad in south central Rakhine,[29]and theGwatoNgathaingchaungroad in far southern Rakhine.[29][30][31]Air travel still is the usual mode of travel fromYangonandMandalayto Sittwe andNgapali, the popular beach resort. Only in 1996 was a highway from Sittwe to the mainland constructed. The state still does not have a rail line (althoughMyanmar Railwayshas announced a 480-km rail extension to Sittwe from Pathein via Ponnagyun-Kyauttaw-Mrauk U-Minbya-Ann).[32]

**The**2012 Rakhine State riots**were a series of conflicts primarily between ethnicRakhineBuddhists andRohingyaMuslims in northernRakhine State,Myanmar, though by October Muslims of all ethnicities had begun to be targeted.[5][6][7]The riots finally came after weeks of sectarian disputes including a gang rape and murder of a Rakhine woman by Rohingyas and killing of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines.[8]On 8 June 2012, Rohingyas started to burn Rakhine's Buddhist and other ethnic houses after returning from Friday's prayers in Maungdaw township. More than a dozen residents were killed in this riot by Rohingya Muslims.[9]State of emergencywas declared in Rakhine, allowing military to participate in administration of the region.[10][11]As of 22 August, officially there had been 88 casualties– 57 Muslims and 31 Buddhists.[1]An estimated 90,000 people were displaced by the violence.[12][13]About 2,528 houses were burned; of those, 1,336 belonged to Rohingyas and 1,192 belonged to Rakhines.[14]**

Rohingya NGOs have accused the Burmese army and police of playing a role in targeting Rohingya through mass arrests and arbitrary violence[15]though an in-depth research by the International Crisis Group reported that members of both communities were grateful for the protection provided by the military.[16]While the government response was praised by theUnited StatesandEuropean Union,[17][18]NGOs were more critical, citing discrimination of Rohingyas by the previous military government.[17]TheUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesand severalhuman rightsgroups rejected the PresidentThein Sein's proposal to resettle the Rohingya abroad.[19][20]

Fighting broke out again in October, resulting in at least 80 deaths, the displacement of more than 20,000 people, and the burning of thousands of homes. Rohingyas are not allowed to leave their settlements, officially due to security concerns, and are the subject of a campaign of commercial boycott led by Buddhist monks.[21]

Sectarian clashes occur sporadically in Rakhine State, often between the BuddhistRakhine peoplewho are majority in the southern part, andRohingyaMuslims who are majority in the north.[22]Before the riots, there were widespread and strongly held fears circulating among Buddhist Rakhines that they would soon become a minority in their ancestral state, and not just the northern part, which has long become a Muslim majority.Rohingyas migrated to Burma fromBengal, today'sBangladeshprimarily before and during the period of British rule,[23][24][25]and to a lesser extent, after the Burmese independence in 1948 andBangladesh Liberation Warin 1971.[22][22][26][27]Rakhines believed that many immigrants arrived even after the 1980s. The Burmese government classifies the Rohingya as "immigrants" to Burma, and thus not eligible for citizenship. Due to their lack of citizenship, they were previously subject to restrictions on government education, officially recognised marriages, and along with ethnic Rakhines, endured forced labour under the military government.[28][29]

On the evening of 28 May, three Muslim youths apparently robbed, raped and murdered an ethnic Rakhine woman, Ma Thida Htwe, near her village Tha Pri Chaung when she was returning home from Kyauk Ni Maw Village of Rambree township.[30]The government doctor who had signed the post-mortem report had however said there was no trace of rape on her murdered body. In addition, one of the accused actually was a Buddhist.[31]

The locals claim the culprits to have been Rohingya Muslims. The police arrested three suspects and sent them toYanbye townshipjail.[32]On 3 June,[33]a mob attacked a bus inTaungup, apparently mistakenly believing those responsible for the murder were on board.[34]Ten Muslims were killed in the attack,[35]prompting protests by Burmese Muslims in the commercial capital, Yangon. The government responded by appointing a minister and a senior police chief to head an investigation committee. The committee was ordered to find out "cause and instigation of the incident" and to pursue legal action.[36]As of 2 July 30 people had been arrested over the killing of the Muslims.[37]

****8 June: Initial attacks[edit]****

Despite increased security measures, at 3:50pm 8 June, a large mob of Rakhine ignited several houses in Bohmu Village,MaungdawTownship where 80% of the population is Rohingya Muslims. Telephone lines were also damaged.[39]By the evening, Hmuu Zaw, a high-ranking officer, reported that the security forces were protecting 14 burnt villages inMaungdawtownship. Around 5:30, the forces were authorised to usedeadly forcebut they fired mostly warning shots according to local media.[39][40]Soon afterward, authorities declared that the situation in Maungdaw Township had been stabilised. However, three villages of southern Maungdaw were torched in early evening. At 9 o'clock, the government imposed curfew in Maungdaw, and forbidding any gathering of more than five persons in public area. An hour later, the rioters had a police outpost in Khayay Mying Village surrounded. The police fired warning shots to disperse them.[40]At 10 o'clock, armed forces had taken positions in Maungdaw. Five people had been confirmed killed as of 8 June.[41]

****9 June: Riots spread[edit]****

On the morning of 9 June, five army battalions arrived to reinforce the existing security forces. Government set up refugee camps for those whose houses had been burned. Government reports stated that Relief and Resettlement Ministry and Ministry of Defense had distributed 3.3 tons of supplies and 2 tons of clothes respectively.[42]

Despite increased security presence, the riots continued unabated. Security forces successfully prevented rioters' attempt to torch five quarters of Maungdaw. However, Rakhine villagers fromButhidaung Township(where 90 percent of people are Rohingya Muslims) arrived at refugee camps after their houses had been razed by Muslims. Soon after, soldiers took positions and anti-riot police patrolled in the township. The Muslim rioters marched to Sittwe and burned down three houses in Mingan quarter. An official report stated that at least 7 people had been killed, one hostel, 17 shops and over 494 houses had been destroyed as of 9 June.[42]

An official report stated that at least 7 people had been killed, one hostel, 17 shops and over 494 houses had been destroyed as of 9 June.[42]

****10 June: State of emergency[edit]****

On 10 June, a state of emergency was declared across Rakhine.[22]According to state TV, the order was given in response to "unrest and terrorist attacks" and "intended to restore security and stability to the people immediately."[22]PresidentThein Seinadded that further unrest could threaten the country's moves toward democracy.[43]It was the first time that the current government used the provision. It instigated martial law, giving the military administrative control of the region.[22]The move was criticised byHuman Rights Watch, who accused the government of handing control over to a military which had historically brutalised people in the region.[43][44]Some ethnic Rakhine burned Rohingya houses in Bohmu village in retaliation.[45]Over five thousand people were residing at refugee camps by 10 June.[46]Many of the refugees fled toSittweto escape the rioting, overwhelming local officials.[43]

****12–14 June[edit]****

On 12 June, more buildings were set ablaze in Sittwe as many residents throughout Rakhine were relocated.[47]"Smoke is billowing from many directions and we are scared," said one ethnic Rakhine resident. "The government should send in more security forces to protect [our] communities."[44]An unnamed government official put the death toll at 25 to date.[44]

The number of casualties were officially revised to 21 on 13 June.[48]A top United Nations envoy visited the region affected by the riots. "We're here to observe and assess how we can continue to provide support to Rakhine [State]," said Ashok Nigam, UN humanitarian coordinator.[48]The envoy later remarked that army appeared to have restored order to the region.[13]

Meanwhile, Bangladeshi authorities continued to turn away refugees, denying another 140 people entry into Bangladesh. To date at least 15 boats and up to 1,500 total refugees had been turned away.[48]Dipu Moni, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, said at a news conference in the capital, Dhaka, that Bangladesh did not have the capacity to accept refugees because the impoverished country’s resources already are strained.[49]The UN called on Bangladesh to reconsider.[50]

On 14 June, the situation appeared calm as casualty figures were updated to 29 deaths– 16 Muslim and 13 Buddhists according to Myanmar authorities.[13]The government also estimated 2,500 homes had been destroyed and 30,000 people displaced by the violence. Thirty-seven camps across Rakhine housed the refugees.[13]Opposition leaderAung San Suu Kyiwarned that violence would continue unless "the rule of law" was restored.[13]

****15–28 June: Fatality figures update and arrest of UN workers[edit]****

As of 28 June, casualty figures were updated to 80 deaths and estimated 90,000 people were displaced and taking refuge in temporary camps according to official reports.[51]Hundreds of Rohingyas fled across the border to Bangladesh, though many were forced back to Burma. Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh also claimed that the Burmese army and police shot groups of villagers after they started the riot. They stated they feared to return to Burma when Bangladesh rejected them as refugees and asked them to go back home.[15][15]Despite the claims made by NGOs, an in-depth research by the International Crisis Group reported that members of both communities were grateful for protection provided by the military.[16]

TheGovernment of Myanmararrested 10 UNUNHCRworkers and charged three with "stimulating" the riots.[52]António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, visitedYangonand asked for the release of the UN workers which Myanmar's PresidentThein Seinsaid he would not allow but asked if the UN would help to resettle up to 1,000,000 Rohingya Muslims in either refugee camps in Bangladesh or some other country.[52]The UN rejected Thein Sein's proposal.[19]

****October riots[edit]****

Violence between Muslims and Buddhists broke out again in late October.[53][54]According to the Burmese government, more than 80 people were killed, more than 22,000 people were displaced, and more than 4,600 houses burnt.[4]The outburst of fighting brought the total number of displaced since the beginning of the conflict to 100,000.[4]

The violence began in the towns of Min Bya and Mrauk Oo by the Muslims, but spread across the state.[53]Though the majority of Rakhine state's Muslims are Rohingya, Muslims of all ethnicities were reported to be targets of the violence in retaliation.[5][6]Several Muslim groups announced that they would not be celebratingEid al-Adhabecause they felt the government could not protect them.[54]

UN Secretary GeneralBan Ki-Moonissued a statement on 26 October that "the vigilante attacks, targeted threats and extremist rhetoric must be stopped. If this is not done ... the reform and opening up process being currently pursued by the government is likely to be jeopardised."[53]US State DepartmentspokeswomanVictoria Nulandcalled on the Burmese government to halt the violence and allow aid groups unrestricted access.[54]On 27 October, a spokesperson for Thein Sein acknowledged "incidents of whole villages and parts of the towns being burnt down in Rakhine state", after Human Rights Watch released a satellite image showing hundreds of Muslim buildings destroyed inKyaukpyuonRamree Island.[5]The United Nations reported on 28 October that 3,200 more displaced people had fled to refugee camps, with an estimated additional 2,500 still in transit.[55]

In early November,Doctors Without Bordersreported that pamphlets and posters were being distributed in Rakhine State threatening aid workers who treated Muslims, causing almost all of its local staff to quit.[56]

****1968–69[edit]****

 The Arakan Liberation Party was founded on 9 April 1967, along with its armed wing, the Arakan Liberation Army, with the help of theKaren National Union(KNU). On 26 November 1968, Khai Ray Khai, a member of the party's central committee, along with nine other associates, were arrested atSittwe, the capital ofRakhine State, by Burmese authorities. On 20 December 1968 Khaing Soe Naing, the party's General Secretary, was arrested by Burmese authorities at Rathedaung Township, in Rakhine State. Following those arrests, several more ALP members were also arrested on different charges, and the party dissolved. The party has accused the government of torturing its imprisoned members.[3]

****1971–77[edit]****

 Between 1971 and 1972, former political prisoners from the ALP were released on amnesty. As soon as Khaing Moe Lunn, a former ALP member, was released, he departed to Komura to meet with KNU leaders in order to re-establish the ALP and ALA. From 1973 to 1974, the ALP was re-established with help from the KNU, and 300 fighters were recruited and trained by the ALA, with Khaing as the President of the ALP and Commander in Chief of the ALA.[3]

Between April and May 1977, 120 insurgents led by Khiang Moe Lunn engaged withIndian governmentforces andBurmese forcesat theIndian-Myanmarborder. 10 ALA insurgents were killed, including Khaing Moe Lunn, over 70 were arrested by Indian and Burmese authorities, and 40 were disarmed and arrested by theBurmese Army. An additional 20 went missing during retreats from government forces. 30 of the arrested wereexecuted, and 55 others were charged withtreasonunder Article 122 of the then constitution. 11 of those charged with treason weresentenced to death, and the rest tolife imprisonment. The party ceased once again after the ALA's defeat.[

****1980–present[edit]****

 In 1980, all ALP and ALA prisoners were released on amnesty. In 1981, the ALP and ALA were once again established, now under the leadership of Khai Ray Khai, and was once again assisted by the KNU. The ALP is presently allied with the KNU, along with theNational Democratic Front(NDF), the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), and the National Council of the Union of Burma (NCUB).

The party was founded on 13 January 2014 and registered with theelection commissionon 6 March 2014.[5][6][7]The chairman of the ANP is Dr.Aye Maung.

****History[edit]****

 On 17 June 2013, TheRakhine Nationalities Development Party(RNDP), led by Dr. Aye Maung, and theArakan League for Democracy(ALD), led byAye Thar Aung, signed an agreement to merge under the name of the Arakan National Party after more than eight months of negotiations.[8]

 In the2015 general election, the party contested 63 seats inRakhine State,Chin State,Ayeyarwady Region, andYangon Region. The party won 10 seats in theAmyotha Hluttaw, 12 in thePyithu Hluttaw, 22 in theRakhine State Hluttaw, and one party member became anEthnic Affairs Minister.[7][9][10][11][12]

 On 8 January 2017, former leaders of the ALD announced that they were splitting from the ANP and were re-registering with the Union Election Commission for the2020 elections, citing internal issues and RNDP dominance in the ANP as the reasons for the split.[13][14]

On 27 November 2017, Dr. Aye Maung tendered his resignation from the party as chairman and member, citing persistent conflicts within the top ranks of the party.[15]

****Rakhine State**(/rÉ™ËˆkaÉªn/;Burmese:á€›á€á€­á€¯á€„á€ºá€•á€¼á€Šá€ºá€”á€šá€º;MLCTS:_ra.hkuing pranynay_,Rakhine pronunciation[É¹É™kÊ°àiÉ´ pÉ¹ènè];Burmese pronunciation:[jÉ™kÊ°àiÉ´ pjìnÉ›Ì€]; formerly**Arakan**) is astateinMyanmar(Burma). Situated on the western coast, it is bordered byChin Stateto the north,Magway Region,Bago RegionandAyeyarwady Regionto the east, theBay of Bengalto the west, and theChittagong DivisionofBangladeshto the northwest. It is located approximately between latitudes 17°30' north and 21°30' north and east longitudes 92°10' east and 94°50' east. TheArakan Mountains, rising to 3,063 metres (10,049ft) atVictoria Peak, separate Rakhine State from central Burma. Off the coast of Rakhine State there are some fairly large islands such asChedubaandMyingun Island. Rakhine State has an area of 36,762 square kilometres (14,194sqmi) and its capital isSittwe.[2]**

The term_Rakhine_is believed to have been derived from thePaliword_Rakkhapura_(Sanskrit Raksapura), meaning "Land ofOgres" (Rakshas), possibly a pejorative referring to the originalNegrito[3]Australoid inhabitants. The Pali word "Rakkhapura" ("Rakkhita") means "land of the people of Rakhasa" (also_Rakkha_,_Rakhaing_). They were given this name in honour of their preservation of their national heritage and ethics or morality.[4]The word Rakhine means, "one who maintains his own race"[5]In theRakhine language, the land is called_Rakhinepray_, the ethnicRakhineare called_Rakhinetha_.

Arakan, used in British colonial times, is believed to be aPortuguesecorruption of the word Rakhine that is still popularly used in English. Many English language users[note 1]eschew the name changes promulgated by the military government.

The history of the region of Arakan (now renamed Rakhine) State can be roughly divided into seven parts. The first four divisions and the periods are based on the location of the centre of power of the main independent Rakhine-dominated polities in the northern Rakhine region, especially along the Kaladan River. Thus, the history is divided into theDhanyawadi,Waithali,LaymroandMrauk U. Mrauk U was conquered by theKonbaung dynastyof Burma in 1784–85, after which Rakhine became part of the Konbaung kingdom of Burma. In 1824, the first Anglo-Burmese war erupted and in 1826, Rakhine (alongsideTanintharyi) was ceded to the British as reparation by the Burmese to the British. Rakhine thus became part of the province of Burma of British India. In 1948, Burma was given independence and Rakhine became part (colony) of the new federal republic.

Based on Rakhine oral histories and inscriptions in certain temples, the history of the Rakhine region dates back nearly five thousand years.[_citation needed_]The Rakhine people trace their societal history back to as far as 3325 BCE and have given a lineal succession of 227 native monarchs and princes down to the last ruler in 1784. They also describe their territory of including, in varying points of time, the regions ofAva, theIrrawaddy Delta, the port town ofThanlyin(Syriam) and parts of eastern Bengal. However, the expanse of the successive Rakhine kingdoms does not exactly corroborate with certain known historical documentation.[_citation needed_]

According to Rakhine legend, the first recorded kingdom arose, centred around the northern town ofDhanyawadiin the 34th century BCE and lasted until 327 CE. Rakhine documents and inscriptions state that the famedMahamuni Buddha imagewas cast in Dhanyawady in around 554 BCE when the Buddha visited the kingdom. After the fall of Dhanyawadi in the 4th century CE, the centre of power shifted to a new dynasty based in the town of Waithali. The Waithali kingdom ruled the regions of Rakhine from the middle of the 4th century to 818 CE. The period is seen as the classical period of Rakhine culture, architecture and Buddhism, as the Waithali period left behind more archaeological remains compared to its predecessor. A new dynasty emerged in four towns along the Laymro river as Waithali waned in influence, and ushered in the Lemro period, where four principal towns served as successive capitals.[_citation needed_]

The finalKingdom of Mrauk Uwas founded in 1429 byMin Saw Mon. It is seen by the Rakhine people as the golden age of their history, as Mrauk U served as a commercially important port and base of power in the Bay of Bengal region and involved in extensive maritime trade with Arabia and Europe.[_citation needed_]The country steadily declined from the 17th century onwards after the loss ofChittagongto theMughal Empirein 1666. Internal instability, rebellion and dethroning of kings were very common. The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness in Asia, gained a temporary establishment in Arakans.[6][7][8]

****Non-Arakanese rule****

On 2 January 1785, the internally divided kingdom fell to invading forces from Konbaung, Burma. The Mahamuni image was taken away by the Burmese as war loot. Thus, an expansionist Burma came into direct territorial contact with territories of the British East India Company, which set the stage for future flaring of hostility. Various geopolitical issues gave rise to the FirstAnglo-Burmese War(1824–26). As the image of Mahamuni had been taken as war loot by the Burmese, this time the huge bell of the temple was taken by theBritish Armyand awarded to a soldier, Bhim Singh, a Risaldar in East India Company's 2nd Division of the British, for his bravery. This inscribed huge bell is still installed in a Mandir at village Nadrai nearKasganjtown in present-day Kanshiram Nagar District of Utter Pradesh India. In theTreaty of Yandabo(1826), which ended hostilities, Burma was forced to cede Arakan alongsideTanintharyi(Tenasserim) toBritish India. The British made Akyab (now Sittwe) the capital of Arakan. Later, Arakan became part of the province of Burma of the British Indian Empire, and then part of British Burma when Burma was made into a separate crown colony. Arakan was administratively divided into three districts along traditional divisions during the Mrauk U period

****1940 onwards[edit]****

Rakhine (Arakan) was the site of many battles during the Second World War, most notably theArakan Campaign 1942–43and theBattle of Ramree Island. Arakan became part of the newly independent Union of Burma in 1948 and the three districts became Arakan Division. From the 1950s, there was a growing movement forsecessionand restoration of Arakan independence. In part to appease this sentiment, in 1974, the socialist government under GeneralNe Winconstituted Rakhine State from Arakan Division giving at least nominal acknowledgment of the regional majority of theRakhine people.

****2012 Rakhine State riots**[edit]**

_Main article:____2012 Rakhine State riots_

The 2012 Rakhine State riots were a series of conflicts between Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhines who are majority in the Rakhine State. Before the riots, there were widespread and strongly held fears circulating among Buddhist Rakhines that they would soon become a minority in their ancestral state.[11]The riots finally came after weeks of sectarian disputes including the death of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines and murder of a Rakhine by Rohingyas.[12][13]From both sides, whole villages were "decimated".[13][14]According to the Burmese authorities, the violence, between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and up to 140,000 people have been displaced.[15][16]The government has responded by imposing curfews and by deploying troops in the region. On 10 June 2012, astate of emergencywas declared in Rakhine, allowing the military to participate in the administration of the region.[17][18]Rohingya NGOs overseas have accused the Burmese army and police of targeting Rohingya Muslims through arrests and participating in violence.[15][19]However, an in-depth research conducted by the International Crisis Group shows that both communities are grateful for the protection provided by the military.[20]A number of monks' organisations have taken measures to block aid from NGOs that help Rohingyas.[21]In July 2012, the Burmese Government did not include the Rohingya minority group in the census—classified asstatelessBengali Muslimsfrom Bangladesh since 1982.[22]About 140,000 Rohingya in Burma remain confined in IDP camps.[23]

Rakhine State (formerly known as Arakan Province), like many parts of Burma, has a diverse ethnic population. Official Burmese figures state Rakhine State's population as 3,118,963.[24]

The ethnicRakhinemake up the majority, followed by a considerable population ofRohingyaMuslims.[25][26]The Rakhine reside mainly in the lowland valleys as well asRamreeandManaung(Cheduba) islands. A number of other ethnic minorities like theThet,Kamein,Chin,Mro,Chakma,Khami,Dainet,Bengali HinduandMaramagriinhabit mainly in the hill regions of the state. Most of the Tibeto-Burmans living in Rakhine State adhere to Theravada Buddhism. Even the Chin, who are usually related with Protestant Christianity or Animism, of Rakhine state adhere to Buddhism due to the cultural influence of the Rakhine people. Muslims constitute more than 80–96% of the population near the border withBangladeshand the coastal areas.

Few roads cross theArakan Mountainsfrom central Burma to Rakhine State. The three highways that do are theAnntoMunbra(Minbyain Burmese pronunciation) road in central Rakhine,[29]theTounguptoPamtaungroad in south central Rakhine,[29]and theGwatoNgathaingchaungroad in far southern Rakhine.[29][30][31]Air travel still is the usual mode of travel fromYangonandMandalayto Sittwe andNgapali, the popular beach resort. Only in 1996 was a highway from Sittwe to the mainland constructed. The state still does not have a rail line (althoughMyanmar Railwayshas announced a 480-km rail extension to Sittwe from Pathein via Ponnagyun-Kyauttaw-Mrauk U-Minbya-Ann).[32]

**The**2012 Rakhine State riots**were a series of conflicts primarily between ethnicRakhineBuddhists andRohingyaMuslims in northernRakhine State,Myanmar, though by October Muslims of all ethnicities had begun to be targeted.[5][6][7]The riots finally came after weeks of sectarian disputes including a gang rape and murder of a Rakhine woman by Rohingyas and killing of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines.[8]On 8 June 2012, Rohingyas started to burn Rakhine's Buddhist and other ethnic houses after returning from Friday's prayers in Maungdaw township. More than a dozen residents were killed in this riot by Rohingya Muslims.[9]State of emergencywas declared in Rakhine, allowing military to participate in administration of the region.[10][11]As of 22 August, officially there had been 88 casualties– 57 Muslims and 31 Buddhists.[1]An estimated 90,000 people were displaced by the violence.[12][13]About 2,528 houses were burned; of those, 1,336 belonged to Rohingyas and 1,192 belonged to Rakhines.[14]**

Rohingya NGOs have accused the Burmese army and police of playing a role in targeting Rohingya through mass arrests and arbitrary violence[15]though an in-depth research by the International Crisis Group reported that members of both communities were grateful for the protection provided by the military.[16]While the government response was praised by theUnited StatesandEuropean Union,[17][18]NGOs were more critical, citing discrimination of Rohingyas by the previous military government.[17]TheUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesand severalhuman rightsgroups rejected the PresidentThein Sein's proposal to resettle the Rohingya abroad.[19][20]

Fighting broke out again in October, resulting in at least 80 deaths, the displacement of more than 20,000 people, and the burning of thousands of homes. Rohingyas are not allowed to leave their settlements, officially due to security concerns, and are the subject of a campaign of commercial boycott led by Buddhist monks.[21]

Sectarian clashes occur sporadically in Rakhine State, often between the BuddhistRakhine peoplewho are majority in the southern part, andRohingyaMuslims who are majority in the north.[22]Before the riots, there were widespread and strongly held fears circulating among Buddhist Rakhines that they would soon become a minority in their ancestral state, and not just the northern part, which has long become a Muslim majority.Rohingyas migrated to Burma fromBengal, today'sBangladeshprimarily before and during the period of British rule,[23][24][25]and to a lesser extent, after the Burmese independence in 1948 andBangladesh Liberation Warin 1971.[22][22][26][27]Rakhines believed that many immigrants arrived even after the 1980s. The Burmese government classifies the Rohingya as "immigrants" to Burma, and thus not eligible for citizenship. Due to their lack of citizenship, they were previously subject to restrictions on government education, officially recognised marriages, and along with ethnic Rakhines, endured forced labour under the military government.[28][29]

On the evening of 28 May, three Muslim youths apparently robbed, raped and murdered an ethnic Rakhine woman, Ma Thida Htwe, near her village Tha Pri Chaung when she was returning home from Kyauk Ni Maw Village of Rambree township.[30]The government doctor who had signed the post-mortem report had however said there was no trace of rape on her murdered body. In addition, one of the accused actually was a Buddhist.[31]

The locals claim the culprits to have been Rohingya Muslims. The police arrested three suspects and sent them toYanbye townshipjail.[32]On 3 June,[33]a mob attacked a bus inTaungup, apparently mistakenly believing those responsible for the murder were on board.[34]Ten Muslims were killed in the attack,[35]prompting protests by Burmese Muslims in the commercial capital, Yangon. The government responded by appointing a minister and a senior police chief to head an investigation committee. The committee was ordered to find out "cause and instigation of the incident" and to pursue legal action.[36]As of 2 July 30 people had been arrested over the killing of the Muslims.[37]

****8 June: Initial attacks[edit]****

Despite increased security measures, at 3:50pm 8 June, a large mob of Rakhine ignited several houses in Bohmu Village,MaungdawTownship where 80% of the population is Rohingya Muslims. Telephone lines were also damaged.[39]By the evening, Hmuu Zaw, a high-ranking officer, reported that the security forces were protecting 14 burnt villages inMaungdawtownship. Around 5:30, the forces were authorised to usedeadly forcebut they fired mostly warning shots according to local media.[39][40]Soon afterward, authorities declared that the situation in Maungdaw Township had been stabilised. However, three villages of southern Maungdaw were torched in early evening. At 9 o'clock, the government imposed curfew in Maungdaw, and forbidding any gathering of more than five persons in public area. An hour later, the rioters had a police outpost in Khayay Mying Village surrounded. The police fired warning shots to disperse them.[40]At 10 o'clock, armed forces had taken positions in Maungdaw. Five people had been confirmed killed as of 8 June.[41]

****9 June: Riots spread[edit]****

On the morning of 9 June, five army battalions arrived to reinforce the existing security forces. Government set up refugee camps for those whose houses had been burned. Government reports stated that Relief and Resettlement Ministry and Ministry of Defense had distributed 3.3 tons of supplies and 2 tons of clothes respectively.[42]

Despite increased security presence, the riots continued unabated. Security forces successfully prevented rioters' attempt to torch five quarters of Maungdaw. However, Rakhine villagers fromButhidaung Township(where 90 percent of people are Rohingya Muslims) arrived at refugee camps after their houses had been razed by Muslims. Soon after, soldiers took positions and anti-riot police patrolled in the township. The Muslim rioters marched to Sittwe and burned down three houses in Mingan quarter. An official report stated that at least 7 people had been killed, one hostel, 17 shops and over 494 houses had been destroyed as of 9 June.[42]

An official report stated that at least 7 people had been killed, one hostel, 17 shops and over 494 houses had been destroyed as of 9 June.[42]

****10 June: State of emergency[edit]****

On 10 June, a state of emergency was declared across Rakhine.[22]According to state TV, the order was given in response to "unrest and terrorist attacks" and "intended to restore security and stability to the people immediately."[22]PresidentThein Seinadded that further unrest could threaten the country's moves toward democracy.[43]It was the first time that the current government used the provision. It instigated martial law, giving the military administrative control of the region.[22]The move was criticised byHuman Rights Watch, who accused the government of handing control over to a military which had historically brutalised people in the region.[43][44]Some ethnic Rakhine burned Rohingya houses in Bohmu village in retaliation.[45]Over five thousand people were residing at refugee camps by 10 June.[46]Many of the refugees fled toSittweto escape the rioting, overwhelming local officials.[43]

****12–14 June[edit]****

On 12 June, more buildings were set ablaze in Sittwe as many residents throughout Rakhine were relocated.[47]"Smoke is billowing from many directions and we are scared," said one ethnic Rakhine resident. "The government should send in more security forces to protect [our] communities."[44]An unnamed government official put the death toll at 25 to date.[44]

The number of casualties were officially revised to 21 on 13 June.[48]A top United Nations envoy visited the region affected by the riots. "We're here to observe and assess how we can continue to provide support to Rakhine [State]," said Ashok Nigam, UN humanitarian coordinator.[48]The envoy later remarked that army appeared to have restored order to the region.[13]

Meanwhile, Bangladeshi authorities continued to turn away refugees, denying another 140 people entry into Bangladesh. To date at least 15 boats and up to 1,500 total refugees had been turned away.[48]Dipu Moni, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, said at a news conference in the capital, Dhaka, that Bangladesh did not have the capacity to accept refugees because the impoverished country’s resources already are strained.[49]The UN called on Bangladesh to reconsider.[50]

On 14 June, the situation appeared calm as casualty figures were updated to 29 deaths– 16 Muslim and 13 Buddhists according to Myanmar authorities.[13]The government also estimated 2,500 homes had been destroyed and 30,000 people displaced by the violence. Thirty-seven camps across Rakhine housed the refugees.[13]Opposition leaderAung San Suu Kyiwarned that violence would continue unless "the rule of law" was restored.[13]

****15–28 June: Fatality figures update and arrest of UN workers[edit]****

As of 28 June, casualty figures were updated to 80 deaths and estimated 90,000 people were displaced and taking refuge in temporary camps according to official reports.[51]Hundreds of Rohingyas fled across the border to Bangladesh, though many were forced back to Burma. Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh also claimed that the Burmese army and police shot groups of villagers after they started the riot. They stated they feared to return to Burma when Bangladesh rejected them as refugees and asked them to go back home.[15][15]Despite the claims made by NGOs, an in-depth research by the International Crisis Group reported that members of both communities were grateful for protection provided by the military.[16]

TheGovernment of Myanmararrested 10 UNUNHCRworkers and charged three with "stimulating" the riots.[52]António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, visitedYangonand asked for the release of the UN workers which Myanmar's PresidentThein Seinsaid he would not allow but asked if the UN would help to resettle up to 1,000,000 Rohingya Muslims in either refugee camps in Bangladesh or some other country.[52]The UN rejected Thein Sein's proposal.[19]

****October riots[edit]****

Violence between Muslims and Buddhists broke out again in late October.[53][54]According to the Burmese government, more than 80 people were killed, more than 22,000 people were displaced, and more than 4,600 houses burnt.[4]The outburst of fighting brought the total number of displaced since the beginning of the conflict to 100,000.[4]

The violence began in the towns of Min Bya and Mrauk Oo by the Muslims, but spread across the state.[53]Though the majority of Rakhine state's Muslims are Rohingya, Muslims of all ethnicities were reported to be targets of the violence in retaliation.[5][6]Several Muslim groups announced that they would not be celebratingEid al-Adhabecause they felt the government could not protect them.[54]

UN Secretary GeneralBan Ki-Moonissued a statement on 26 October that "the vigilante attacks, targeted threats and extremist rhetoric must be stopped. If this is not done ... the reform and opening up process being currently pursued by the government is likely to be jeopardised."[53]US State DepartmentspokeswomanVictoria Nulandcalled on the Burmese government to halt the violence and allow aid groups unrestricted access.[54]On 27 October, a spokesperson for Thein Sein acknowledged "incidents of whole villages and parts of the towns being burnt down in Rakhine state", after Human Rights Watch released a satellite image showing hundreds of Muslim buildings destroyed inKyaukpyuonRamree Island.[5]The United Nations reported on 28 October that 3,200 more displaced people had fled to refugee camps, with an estimated additional 2,500 still in transit.[55]

In early November,Doctors Without Bordersreported that pamphlets and posters were being distributed in Rakhine State threatening aid workers who treated Muslims, causing almost all of its local staff to quit.[56]
