(i.e Hachhek, Dampa, Mamit,Tuirial, Kolasib, Serlui, Lunglei South, Thorang, West Tuipui)_

_Comments:_

_Livelihood opportunity for survival of the Bru migrants is adequately addressed in the Action Plan (Road Map-IV) for Repatriation & Rehabilitation of Reang(Bru) prepared by Home Department, Government of Mizoram. However, the Bru migrants after they resettle in Mizoram should also work/fight for their own survival. Arrangement of Perpetual supply of free rations to Bru resettled in Mizoram would be a huge challenge for a state like Mizoram._

Threatening and harassing on the President of MBDPF Mr. A.Sawibunga as a defamation case filed against him by YMA of Mamit Sub-Headquarters in 2014 on baseless allegation and District Judicial Court, Mamit issued warrant of arrest against him.
