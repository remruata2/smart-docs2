**SIGNING OF PEACE ACCORD BETWEEN GOVERNMENT OF MIZORAM AND HMAR PEOPLES CONVENTION(HPC):**

 In 1986 the Hmar Peoples Convention(HPC) was formed with the sole objective of the creation of an Autonomous District Council (ADC) for the Hmars within Mizoram. Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent unlawful activities like abducting and killing of the Mizoram Police personnel, extorting money etc. and thus jeopardising the law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area. However, Mizoram Police was geared up and the Government of Mizoram managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants resulting in the signing of a Peace Accord on 27th July 1994. The HPC militants surrendered formally to the Govt. of Mizoram as per the provision of this Accord and these persons were given financial grants for their rehabilitation etc. The Govt. of Mizoram also agreed to set up the Sinlung Hills Dev. Council (SHDC) for the welfare of the people living in the Hmar dominated areas. Accordingly adhoc Chairman and members constituting the council were even appointed by the Govt. of Mizoram from among the leaders of the erstwhile HPC set up. Peace was thus restored in Mizoram after the signing of the Accord.

**FORMATION OF HPC(D) :**

 However, in spite of the Accord, there were still a disgruntled section of the HPC set up, led by Lalhmingthanga senate, the then General Secretary of the HPC who were not ready to lay down their arms as they were not in agreement with the terms of the Peace Accord. Soon after, a new militant outfit was formed by L.Z.Hrangchal, the then Marshal of HPC, known as the _'Hmar Revolutionary Front'_(HRF) with base in Parbung Sub-Division of Churachandpur District, Manipur. Following closely, Lalhmingthanga Senate also formed a militant outfit called the Hmar Peoples Convention- Democratic (HPC-(D)) in 1996 with its nerve centre at Hmarkhawlian (Lakhipur) in Cachar District of Assam. The 2(two) newly formed outfits are totally opposed to each other both proclaiming themselves as champion of the political aspirations of the Hmars, and both resorted to seeking the assistance of other insurgents such as the NSCN(I/M) and the People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) for subduing each other in their struggle for supremacy. Lalhmingthanga Senate in particular has been having close connection with the NSCN(I/M) even before the signing of the Peace Accord in 1994.

**NON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEMORANDUM OF SETTLEMENT FROM HPC SIDE :**

 After the formation of HPC(D) in 1996, far from securing peace, the state was again suffering militancy and normalcy was greatly affected especially in the northern parts of the state .The formation of this HPC(D),which was formed by the remnants of former HPC cadres could be considered as contravention of para 4.1 and 4.4 of the MOS signed between Government of Mizoram and Hmar People's Convention which are as under -

**Para 4.1****:** With a view to restoring peace and normalcy in Mizoram, the HPC on their part agree to undertake, within the agreed time-frame, all necessary steps to end all under-ground activities, to bring out all underground personnel of the HPC with their arms, ammunition and equipments to ensure their return to civil life, to abjure violence and help in the process of restoration of normalcy. The modalities of bringing out all underground personnel will be worked out. The implementation of the foregoing will be under the supervision of Government of Mizoram.

**Para 4.4****:** The HPC undertake not to extend any support to NSCN, ULFA and any other such underground groups by supply of arms or providing protection or any other manner.
