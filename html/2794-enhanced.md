_ACHIEVEMENT OF CID (SB) FOR THE LAST 50 (FIFTY) YEARS_

1. **Achievements on Insurgency / Militancy Issues:**

1. **Signing of Peace Accord between the Government of Mizoram and HPC**_:_

 In 1986 the Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) was formed with the sole objective of creation of an Autonomous District Council (ADC) for the Hmars community within Mizoram. Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent unlawful activities like abduction and killing of the Mizoram Police personnel, extortion of money etc. and thus jeopardizing the law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area. However, Mizoram Police was geared up and the Government of Mizoram managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants resulting in the signing of a Peace Accord on 27th July 1994. A total of 331 HPC militants surrendered formally to the Govt. of Mizoram as per the provision of this Accord and these persons were given financial grants for their rehabilitation etc. Peace was thus restored in Mizoram after the signing of the Accord. It may be mentioned that CID (SB) played an active role for the signing of the stated peace accord.

1. **Signing of Peace Accord By Government of Mizoram and Hmar Peoples Convention Democratic (HPC 'D') :**

Some leaders of HPC dissatisfied with this peace accord signed with government of Mizoram and had formed the Hmar People’s Convention (Democratic) under the leadership of Lalhmingthanga Senate in 1996 with its nerve centre at Hmarkhawlian (Lakhipur) in Cachar District of Assam. After the formation of HPC (D) in 1996, far from securing peace, the state was again suffering militancy and normalcy was greatly affected especially in the northern parts of the state.

 Due to the initiative taken by SP CID (SB), 5(five) rounds of Peace Dialogue between Government of Mizoram and HPC (D) were conducted during the year 2016 and 2017. Following the peace dialogue held between government of Mizoram and HPC (D) the following arms and ammunitions, which were snatched away by HPC (D) cadres from Mizoram Police during an ambushed laid by HPC(D) cadres against an entourage party of Committee on Government Assurance members on 28.3.2015 at the outskirt of Zokhawthiang village, Aizawl District were handed over to Government of Mizoram.

As per scheduled, the Political Level Peace Talk between Mizoram State Government and HPC-D was held under a cordial environment at the State Guest House, Aizawl during 7th &amp; 8th March, 2018 and the Peace Talk ended with a logical conclusion on 8.3.2018.

 Government of Mizoram and HPC-D signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2.4.2018 at the function held at the State Guest House, Aizawl. Shri. Arvind Ray, the then Chief Secretary of Mizoram and Pu H. Zosangbera, the then Chairman, HPC-D signed the MoS on behalf of the State Government and HPC-D respectively. The signing of MoS brought an end to the over two-decades armed conflict of the HPC-D. The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held at CTI, Sesawng on 13.4.2018 wherein 102(one hundred and two) Cadres and 12(twelve) Council Members of HPC(D) came to over ground at the ceremony. 44(forty four) different Firearms with 48 magazines and 2892 rounds of different ammunitions along with Radio Sets with charger were surrendered by HPC (D) at the ceremony.

III. _Signing of MoU with Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF):_

 The BNLF was formed on 9.11.1996 at Tuirum to strengthen the repeated demands of Autonomous District Council for Bru people living in western belt of Mizoram by Bru National Union.

 To end militant activities of BNLF and with the initiatives of CID (SB), Govt. of Mizoram initiated Peace Talk with leaders of BNLF w.e.f. 7.9.2001 and after 12 rounds of peace talks between Govt. of Mizoram and BNLF, an MoU was signed between BNLF and Govt. of Mizoram on 26.4.2005.

 In pursuance of the MoU signed on 26.4.2005, 195(one hundred ninety five) strong BNLF cadres and their family members were temporarily sheltered at Sidon Transit Camp, Tuipuibari.

IV. _Signing of MoU with Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM):_

 The Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM) was formed in December, 2001 at Naisingpara refugee camp, Tripura under the leadership of Shri. Vanlalliana, founder president of BNLF, and later overthrown by his own men.

With the signing of Memorandum of Understanding between BNLF (a premier Bru Insurgent Outfit) and Government of Mizoram, the BLFM cadres were expected to come over ground and join the mainstream to enjoy rehabilitation and other facilities at par with BNLF. However, this hope was shattered by the BLFM themselves by committing kidnapping of two employees of Teirei Mini Hydel Project from the dam site on 8.8.2005.

 However, with the initiative of CID(SB) 38 (thirty eight) cadres of BLFM led by A. Zoramthanga, splinter group of BLFM headed (former Vice President of BLFM) and Lalrinkima, General Secretary surrendered to the Government of Mizoram along with their weapons on 16.3.2006. Later 4 (four) cadres surrendered on 6.7.2006 and 11(eleventh) cadres on 17.8.2006. Altogether 53 (fifty three) cadres of A. Zoramthanga faction of BLFM surrendered before Government of Mizoram by the turn of September, 2006.

In the aftermath of the above mentioned surrendered of BLFM cadres, four BLFM top brass leaders viz. (1) Vanlalliana, President; (2) Vanrama, Vice President; (3) Romawia Meska, COAS and (4) Lallawma, SS Capt. were arrested on 20.4.2006 by Mizoram Police CID (SB) which was another major blow to the BLFM.

Out of frustration due to arrest of their top leaders and surrender of 53 cadres of BLFM, the remaining 804(eight hundred four) strong members of BLFM decided to lay down their arms and surrendered to the Government of Mizoram unconditionally. As such, the remaining BLFM cadres, laid down their arms on 26.10.2006 and were temporarily sheltered in two Transit Camps viz. Damparengpui and Tuipuibari, Mamit District.

 In the strife-torn North East India, it is commendable of being the least militant infected State and it is mainly due to the swift action of Mizoram Police and the active role played by CID (SB) in nabbing militancy in its budding stage.
