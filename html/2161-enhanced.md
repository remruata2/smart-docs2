To

 The Sr. Superintendent of Police

 Aizawl District

 Aizawl, Mizoram

Subject: Identification of Sensitive/Critical Polling Stations.

Ref. : No. AZL-DEF/L&amp;O/VC-40/2020/1117 dt. 29.7.2020

Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, this is to state that there were 29 Critical Polling Stations during the Mizoram Legislative Assembly General Election, 2018.

 The Hmar ethnic group has been fighting for autonomy since 1994. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (The insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decades armed insurgency of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where 102 Cadres and 12 Council Members of HPC(D) came to over ground at the ceremony.

 But, others are more sceptical about the outcome of the MoS for 2 (tw0) resons. Firstly, 

 Therefore, there is no sensitive/critical Polling Stations at the moment.

 This is for your kind information and further necessary action please.

Enclosed : As mentioned.

Yours faithfully,

**(K.LALREMSANGA)**
