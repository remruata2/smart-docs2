_KUKI CHIN NATIONAL FRONT (KNF) - Brief History & activities_

 This organisation was founded in the year 2008 by elements of Z0-ethnic living in Bangladesh as Kuki-Chin National Development Organisation (KNDO).

 Two years after its establishment, leaders of this organisation sought assistance from Kachin National Army (KNA), a militant outfit operating in Myanmar, for training which resulted in about 20-40 KNDO cadres receiving training from KNA during the year 2017-2020. After these cadres completed their training, their organisation was renamed as Kuki Chin National Front. (KNF).

 The main objective of this organisation is to unite Zo-ethnic tribes including CHIN tribes living in Myanmar-Bangladesh bordering areas into one autonomous region having a development budget of their own from Bangladesh Government.

 It may also be mentioned that, after the completion of their training under KNA, cadres of KNF did not take any arms and ammunition with them as this could hamper their safe return journey home to Bangladesh.

 Leaders of Kuki-Chin National Front from Bangladesh frequently visited Mizoram where they often met leaders of PAMRA and even Government officials whenever necessary. Some of them even proceed up to Myanmar during these visits.

CAMPS: The Headquarters of KNF is situated at SALOPI, Bandharban district, near RUMA BAZAR in Bangladesh. Other camps are also established at Chitatagong and Khakrausuri areas. After their conflict with Arakan Army (16.11.2022) KNF shifted their camps in the areas around Sungsong and Chaihkhiang, Bangladesh.

NUMBER OF CADRES : KNF claims to have around 700 cadres which includes civil and army wing. However, other source believed them to be around 500-600 in numbers.

LEADERS of KNF :

 1.President : Nathan @ Nathan Bawm of Ruma, Eden Road, Bangladesh

 2. Vice President : Vanchunglian of Eden Village, Bangladesh

 3.General Secretary : Lalhimliana, Hmunnuam, Bangladesh

 4. Assistant Secretary : Lalsanglawma, Ruma Bazar, Bangladesh

 5. Army Chief : Vanchunglian, Bangladesh

Recent activities : After the intensive gun battle between KNF and Arakan Army, civilians living in these areas were greatly intimidated by both the Arakan Army and Bangladesh Army. These panicked civilians from different villages, whose number reached around 400/500 tried to enter Mizoram as refugees. They were, however, restricted by the border guarding forces (BSF) from entering Mizoram/India with the pretext of having receive no orders from their superiors to allowed them to enter Mizoram which resulted in many of the civilians/refugees being pushed back to Bangladesh side.

 On 20.11.2022 and 21.11.2022 refugees started entering Simnosara and parva-3 respectively. Currently, the refugees accommodated in Mizoram numbered around 327 people.

 On 22nd December 2022, around 580 refugees tried to enter Simnasor in Mizoram. Pu Gospela, Parva-3 VCP and party, who tried to enquire about the plight of these refugees were apprehended by personnel of BSF and were also subjected to rough handling which greatly infuriated the VCP and party.

 Again on the night of Dt. 4.1.2023 at around 8:30 pm, Pu Sawmkhupa (85), a retired BCM Pastor, who was one of the refugees trying to enter Mizoram died in the jungle in an area around Tuichonglui. The dead body of this person is being mourned by around 300 civilian on the spot. However, till now, no indication of any action which may lead to Law &amp; Order problems as a consequence of this death are found to exists. Efforts are being taken by members of YMA Parva-3 Branch and O.C,Vaseikai Police Station to retrieve the dead body.

 According to information received, KNF often facilitated one Islamic militant outfit of Bangladesh - Jamaatul Ansar Fil Hindal Shargiya in their training camps and in return received a monetary sum of 30 lakhs Taka each month. This, however, was strongly denied by the KNF stating that it was totally baseless.

i)  As per information received, 40 Bangladesh Nationals (10 Male, 07 Female, 12 Male Child and 11 Female Child) after illegally crossing the International Boundary first reached Tuisentlang on 12.3.2023 at around 1430 hrs and using civil vehicles they further reached Village-Chamdur P1 at around 1730 hrs the same day.

 As revealed by these illegal immigrants, they left their villages namely Rumana, Lungthawse and Sungsawnpara, Distt- Banderban(Bangladesh) on 07th March 2023 at about 0500 hrs and reached Tuisengtlang on 12.03.2023 at about 1430 hrs. Finally they reached Vil- Chamdur P1 by using 02 civil trucks at about 1730 hrs. They are presently accommodated at community hall Vill- Chamdur P1. In the past too, many such groups have illegally entered Indian Territory and these illegal infiltrations may have serious law and order repercussions in days to come. Moreover, further retention of these illegal Bangladesh Nationals is going to encourage more such attempts.

 In connection to this, the matter with the information received from SHQ, BSF, Aizawl was forwarded to the Under Secretary to Government of Mizoram, Home Department, Aizawl for further action as deemed necessary vide Mizoram PHQ letter No. CB/PHQ/C/212/70 Dt. 22.3.2023.

 Interrogation on these apprehended Bangladeshi were conducted by a joint team comprising of representatives from CID(SB), SB, Assam Rifles, BSF and SIB. During interrogation, it was revealed that they are members of Bangladesh-based

Mogh Bahini, a militant outfit also known as Mogh Liberation Party (MLP). They stated that they have three camps inside Bangladesh and that Bangalhali is their main camp which is located near a Bangladeshi Army camp. The cadre strength according to them in their main camp is approximately 80. The two other camps of their outfit are based at Paitu Para in Rangamati District and Chakhua Para. Also in Rangamati District, Bangladesh. They also stated that the outfit had a good understanding with the Bangladeshi Army.

 As per their statement, the main reason for them entering into Indian territory is that having left their outfit and fearing for their lives at the hands of MLP, they chose to come to Aizawl, Mizoram since Saching Marma already had an acquaintance and also to search for a potential workplace due to financial crisis in Bangladesh.
