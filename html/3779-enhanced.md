****HPC(D)****

 The Hmar communities who settled in the North Eastern parts of Mizoram have been demanding a separate Autonomous District Council for more than 2 (two) decades by taking up arms. A peace accord was signed way back in 1994 between Government of Mizoram and HPC, the Hmar militant group. However, certain groups of persons who are disgruntled with the accord continued their armed activities resorting to kidnapping, collecting donations, extortion and threats in Sinlung Hills Development Council Areas and formed HPC(D). They even hampered the proper functioning of our Democracy by intimidating the Hmar community not to participate in the recent Village Council election of Mizoram. This resulted in the arrest of their top leaders.

The HPC-D was formed in 1996 by remnants of the HPC who were disgruntled with the MoU signed between HPC and Govt. of Mizoram in 1994. The HPC-D resorted to violence from the outset of its formation like extortion, kidnapping and ambush of security forces.

The HPC-D had split into two factions on 29.9.2011. One faction is led by the outset President Lalhmingthanga Sanate and the other faction led by H. Zosangbera. HPC-D H. Zosangbera faction is more active and reportedly now in possession of 34 nos. of arms of different types and 950 ammunitions.

Zosangbera reportedly stated that he could not decided on his one regarding the restoration of the dissolved of YMA branches and referred the CYMA to talk to representatives of HPC(D who participated in the meeting for the signing of the Ground Rules to which the CYMA reportedly agreed to comply with.

18.7.13 Talks between representatives of Mizoram Government and HPC(D) was held in Tourist Lodge, Aizawl today. The HPC(D) delegates headed by the working Chairman Lalthangliana also known as LT. Hmar have arrive in Aizawl from Manipur yesterday. Mizoram Government representatives were headed by Pu Lalbiakzama, Joint Secretary, Home Department.

29.7.13 **PR of HPC(D) dt. 29th July 2013**: The Govt. of Mizoram and the HPC(D) had a political talks at Conference Hall, Tourist Lodge, Chaltlang, Aizawl on 18th July 2013. The GoM side was led by Lalbiakzama, Jt. Secretary, GoM, Home Deptt., Ramthlengliana, SP CID(SB), Lalchungnunga, Addl DC, Aizawl district, Lalhriatpuia, Dy.Secretary(Home), David H. Lalthangliana, OSD(Home), Laltanpuia Sailo, Inspr. of Police(interpreter). The HPC(D) delegates was led by LT Hmar, Working Chairman HPC(D), Lalchhanhima, Council Member HPC(D), Lalthalien(delegate), Joseph R.Hmar(delegate), Lalmuanpuia Punte(spokesperson), Rohringa(delegate) and Lalremruata Varte(delegate).

 LT. Hmar, working Chairman HPC(D) submitted the memorandum of the HPC(D) that was addressed to the Chief Minister of Mizoram. The same memorandum was also addressed to the GoM, the Union Home Minister and Jt. Secretary (North East), Govt. of India.

 The HPC(D) memorandum termed the July 27, 1994 Memorandum of Settlement(MoS)/Peace Accord that was signed between the GoM and the HPC a hollow political instrument; and not accepted by the HPC(D). 19 years after signing of the MoS, it has proved to the world that the document holds no water and does not stand to fulfill the aspirations of the Hmar people to secure their political future.

 In pursuance of the unfinished agenda of the Hmar people, the HPC(D) is committed to find a lasting, dignified and acceptable political solution to the Hmar's aspirations with the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council in the State of Mizoram within the scope of the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. This will be of mutual benefit and based on the long term interest of both the Sinlung originated Hmar peoples and the GoM.

 The HPC(D) remain fully and firmly committed not to seek separation from Mizoram but rather seek to find a permanent solution to the protracted Hmar issue in Mizoram, which is compatible with the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India. The HPC(D) firmly believes that to protect Hmar identity, culture, tradition, language, land, resources and to enhance political development and democratic decentralization in Mizoram, the only pragmatic option lies in the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council.

 HPC(D) advocates a long term solution that addresses and ends the political marginalization suffered by the Hmar people in Mizoram. It also believes that no solution will lead to enduring peace if it is devoid of political justice and political will and it would not be just if it does not promote and enhance the political aspirations of the Hmar peoples.

 The HPC(D) demands that the Union Government of India and the Government of Mizoram make sincere, committed and concerted efforts to fulfill the aspirations of the Hmar peoples. The unfinished agenda should be politically settled in accordance with the Constitution of India with the following objectives:

 1. To initiate tripartite dialogue involving the Govt. of India, Govt. of Mizoram and the Hmar Peoples Convention-Democratic for the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council within the State of Mizoram.

 2. To provide constitutional safeguards and protection to the Autonomous body as under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.

 In the course of the dialogue, the issue of further extension of SoS which is due to expire in July 2013 was raised by Team Leader representing the GoM. The HPC(D) leaders firmly maintains its stands that any furhther extension of SoO should be intricately linked with fixation of definite timeline for political dialogue within the month of July 2013. The talks met a stalemate as it was submitted by the HPC(D) delegates that the issue of further extension of SoO also require prior consultation and decision of the HPC(D) council.

 The HPC(D) strongly felt that extension of SoO in Mizoram has no meaning if the prospect for a meaningful political dialogue is not put in place. The democratic interests and aspirations of the Hmar people should not be down played by a negligent and irresponsible delay tactics. The Hmar's aspirations is to justly secure the Constitutional promises, which otherwise has marginalized us.

13.9.13 Mizoram Hmar Welfare Committee sponsored Peace Rally cum Procession was held in Suangpuilawn village today. A number of persons from the nearby villages Lamherh, Vanbawng, Zawngin and Khawlek also participated in the rally. Several resolution were also passed by the participants which included their demand for successful conclusion of the present talks between the Govt. and HPC(D) for peaceful solution of the so called HPC problem once for all, implementation of point no.6 - one of the Memorandum of Settlement signed between the Govt. and HPC on 27th July 1994 and creation of Autonomous District Councils for the Tribals in Mizoram under the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution.

1.9.13 The HPC(D) under the command of Biaklien, S/S Commander reportedly received fresh recruitment drive at Saiphai, Saipum and Vairengte and around 11 new members have reportedly been recruited. The HPC(D) army wing also convene a meeting of commander level at Kasur Valley and they are likely to reach Kasur Valley(Ankachhuah) on 17.9.2013.

3.10.13 In a Press release issued on 1.10.2013, the Hmar People Convention (Democrats) militant outfit accused the Congress Government of Mizoram of betraying the HPC (D) and not sincere enough in resuming the peace talk. The HPC(D) underlined its objection to the recent government's notification on delimitation of constituencies of Sinlung Hills Development Council. The HPC (D) also expressed its support for the initiatives of CYMA on the issue of Tipaimuk Dam construction and also warned all the Government servants and constructors working within its demand area not to neglect their duties.

(b)  They should cooperate with volunteers of HPC (D) who are being sent to infiltrate into various other villages within the HPC (D) demand area.

(c)  To convey a message to the Government of Mizoram that, the HPC(D) strongly resented the Government’s attitude for non – resumption of Peace talk with HPC (D).

 The statement by the HPC (D) Army Chief suggesting infiltration by their volunteers into SHDC area, and the open display of their weapons appeared to be an obvious intimidation, not merely to disrupt the election process but to impose a **diktat** to the public within their demand area to vote for candidates being fielded probably from the Mizoram Hmar Welfare committee.

 All District Police and Armed Police Battalion having area of responsibility in the HPC (D) demand area need to be on high alert and tighten security in order to prevent any commission of subversive activities by HPC (D).
