**20.03.2018**The meeting of Chief Secretaries of Assam and Mizoram held under the chairmanship of Union Home Secretary, Govt. of India in New Delhi on 20.3.2018 on the interstate border issue in the context of the recent incidents at Bairabi on 8th and 10th March, 2018 have decided to maintain status quo at the disputed site and it has also been decided that both the Government of Assam and Mizoram will take all measures to maintain peace in their respective areas.

The Meeting also unanimously decided that a team comprising Joint Secretary, North East and Principal Secretaries (Home) of Mizoram and Assam will visit the disputed area within a week and the team will be assisted by officials of Survey of India in its work. It has also been decided that the team will submit its findings of the Union Home Secretary which will be discussed in a follow up meeting with the Chief Secretaries of the two states. Thereafter, a meeting will be convened by the Union Home Minister with the Chief Ministers of Mizoram and Assam.

** The above decisions seemed to have evoked strong response from the Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP), a student union of Mizoram which had spearheaded an activity to construct Zofate Chawlhbuk at Zophai, near Bairabi, Kolasib District located along the Assam- Mizoram border as they claimed that the said land is located within the territory of Mizoram and that it belongs to Ch.Chhunga (L), the first Chief Minister of Mizoram. In fact, the MZP had constructed Zofate Chawlhbuk at Zophai on 27th Feb., 2018 but the shed was demolished on the same day by some persons reportedly at the instance of Assam Police and Forest Officials. It may be pertinent to mention that a Police Duty Post have also been constructed supposedly by the Assam Police at the same site on 2.3.2018 which was also dismantled by some persons reportedly at the behest of Mizo Student Union. At the same time, some advisor of MZP are of the opinion that the decisions taken at the Home Secretary’s meeting with the Chief Secretaries of Assam and Mizoram should be endorsed and the road map prepared therein should also be duly carried out. **Input indicated that MZP Gen.Hqrs, Aizawl will convene an Executive Committee meeting at MZP office, Treasury Square, Aizawl on 21.3.2018 @ 1:00 p.m. The meeting will also be attended by Student Unions of various colleges within Aizawl City including Hnampual Student Union (Sub-Tribes of Mizo). They are likely to ponder upon the decisions taken by the Chief Secretaries of Assam and Mizoram and they are also likely to take a decision as to whether they will go ahead with construction of Zofate Chawlhbuk at the disputed site or not.****

 At the same time, while Central Young Mizo Association (CYMA) are learnt to be in favour of the decisions taken by the Chief Secretaries of Assam and Mizoram to bring lasting solutions to the border disputes, however, in order to meet the aspirations of the MZP and most importantly to soothe their anger in the wake of the alleged atrocities committed upon them by the Assam Police, they are also in favour of construction of Zofate Chawlhbuk at Zophai by MZP.
