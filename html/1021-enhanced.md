Insurgency in Northeast India

****Insurgency in Northeast India**involves multiple armed factions operating inIndia'snortheastern states, which are connected to the rest of India by theSiliguri Corridor, a strip of land as narrow as 14 miles (23km) wide.[_citation needed_]Some factions favour a separate state while others seekregional autonomy. Some groups demand complete independence.**

Northeastern India consists of seven states (also known as the_Seven Sister States_):Assam,Meghalaya,Tripura,Arunachal Pradesh,Mizoram,Manipur, andNagaland. Tensions exist between these states and the central government as well as amongst their native tribal people and migrants from other parts of India. Regional tensions eased off in late 2013, with the Indian and state governments making a concerted effort to raise the living standards of people in these regions. However, in late 2014 tensions again rose as the Indian government launched an offensive, which led to a retaliatory attack on civilians by tribal guerrillas.[16]As of 1 January 2015, major militant activities are being conducted inAssam,Manipur,NagalandandTripura.

TheIndian general election, 2014had an 80%voter turnoutin all northeastern states, the highest among all states of India. Indian authorities claim that this shows the faith of the northeastern people in Indian democracy.[17]Despite this, a number of organizationslisted as terrorist groupscontinue to promote an insurgency.[18][19][20]

Assam[edit]

_Main articles:__Assamese nationalism__and Bodo nationalism_

Assamhas been a refuge for militants for a number of years, due to its porous borders withBangladeshandBhutan. The main causes of the friction include anti-foreigner agitation in the 1980s, and the simmering Assam-Bodo tensions. The insurgency status in Assam is classified as "very active".[_citation needed_]The government of Bangladesh has arrested and extradited senior leaders of the ULFA.[24]

**ULFA**[edit]

TheUnited Liberation Front of Assamwas formed in April 1979 to establish a sovereign state of Assam through armed struggle. In recent times the organisation has lost its middle rung leaders after most of them were arrested.[24]

**NDFB**[edit]

TheNational Democratic Front of Bodolandwas formed in 1989 as the Bodo Security Force, and aims to set up an independent countryBodoland.[_citation needed_]

**KLNLF**[edit]

TheKarbi Longri N.C. Hills Liberation Frontis a militant group operating in theKarbi AnglongandDima Hasaodistricts ofAssamthat was formed on 16 May 2004. The outfit claims to fight for the cause of Karbi tribes, and its declared objective is Hemprek Kangthim, meaning self-rule/self-determination of theKarbi people. It is closely linked with the ULFA (United Liberation Front of Asom)[_citation needed_]

**UPDS**[edit]

TheUnited People's Democratic Solidaritywas formed in March 1999 with the merger of two terrorist outfits in Assam's Karbi Anglong district, the Karbi National Volunteers (KNV) and the Karbi People’s Front (KPF).[_citation needed_]

In 2004, the UPDS (Anti-Talks) renamed itself as theKarbi Longri North Cachar Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF), and its armed wing as the Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Resistance Force (KNPR).

In 2014 the UPDS disbanded, following the mass surrender of all it cadres and leaders.[25]

**DHD**[edit]

TheDima Halam Daoga(DHD) is a descendant of the Dimasa National Security Force (DNSF), which ceased operations in 1995. Commander-in-Chief Jewel Gorlosa, refused to surrender and launched the Dima Halam Daogah. After the peace agreement between the DHD and the central government in the year 2003, the group further broke out and DHD(J) also known as Black Widow was born which was led by Jewel Gorlosa. The Black Widow's declared objective is to create Dimaraji for the Dimasa people in Dima Hasao district only. However the objective of DHD (Nunisa faction) is to include parts of Cachar, Karbi Anglong, and Nagaon districts in Assam, and sections of Dimapur district in Nagaland.

In 2009 the group surrendered en masse to theCRPFand local police, 193 cadres surrendering on 2009-09-12 and another 171 on the 13th.[26]

**KLO**[edit]

The objective of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) is to carve out a separateKamtapurState. The proposed state is to comprise six districts inWest Bengaland four contiguous districts ofAssamwhich areCooch Behar,Darjeeling,Jalpaiguri, North and SouthDinajpurandMaldaofWest Bengaland four contiguous districts of Assam –Kokrajhar,Bongaigaon,DhubriandGoalpara. The KLO in the beginning was an over-ground[_clarification needed_]organisation which was formed to address problems of theKoch Rajbongshi peoplesuch as large-scale unemployment, land alienation, perceived neglect ofKamtapuri language, identity, and grievances of economic deprivation.[27]

Manipur[edit]

_Main article:__Insurgency in Manipur_

Manipur's long tradition of independence can be traced to the foundation of theKangleipak Statein 1110. The Kingdom of Manipur was conquered byGreat Britainfollowing the briefAnglo-Manipuri Warof 1891, becoming a British protectorate.[28]

Manipur became part of the Indian Union on 15 October 1949. Manipur's incorporation into the Indian state soon led to the formation of a number of insurgent organisations, seeking the creation of an independent state within the borders of Manipur, and dismissing the merger with India as involuntary.[29]

Despite the fact that Manipur became a separate state of the Indian Union on 21 January 1972, the insurgency continued.[28]On 8 September 1980, Manipur was declared an area of disturbance, when the Indian government imposed theArmed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958on the region; the act currently remains in force.[29]

The parallel rise ofNaga nationalismin neighbouringNagalandled to the emergence of theNational Socialist Council of Nagaland(NSCN) activities in Manipur. Clashes between the Isak-Muivah and Khaplang factions of the NSCN further aggravated tensions, asKuki tribalsbegan creating their own guerrilla groups in order to protect their interests from alleged Naga violations. Skirmishes between the two ethnic groups took place during the 1990s. Other ethnic groups such as thePaite,Vaiphei,PangalsandHmarsfollowed suit establishing militant groups.[29]

**UNLF**[edit]

The first separatist faction known as the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) was founded on 24 November 1964.

**PLA, PREPAK and KCP, KRA, and the student organisation**[edit]

Between 1977 and 1980, thePeople's Liberation Army of Manipur(PLA), thePeople's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak(PREPAK) and theKangleipak Communist Party(KCP), were formed, immediately joining the war.[29]

Nagaland[edit]

_Main articles:__Naga nationalism__and__Nagaland conflict_

Nagaland was created in 1963 as the 16th state of the Indian Union, before which it was a district of Assam. Insurgent groups classified as active mainly demand full independence. TheNaga National Councilled byPhizowas the first group to dissent in 1947 and in 1956 they went underground.[_citation needed_]

**NSCN(IM)**[edit]

TheNational Socialist Council of Nagalandwas formed in 1980 to establish a Greater Nagaland, encompassing parts of Manipur, Nagaland, and the north Cachar hills (Assam). The NSCN split in 1988 to form two groups, NSCN(IM) and NSCN(K). As of 2015, both groups have observed a ceasefire truce with the Indian government.[30]

**NSCN(K)**[edit]

TheNational Socialist Council of Nagaland—Khaplangis the second faction with the same aim of a Greater Nagaland and was formed in 1988.[31][32][33][34]

Tripura[edit]

_Main article: Tripuri nationalism_

The insurgent groups inTripuraemerged at the end of the 1970s, as ethnic tensions between theBengaliimmigrants and the tribal native population who were outnumbered by the former, hailing from other parts of India and nearby Bangladesh, which resulted in their being reduced to minority status even threatening them economically, socially, culturally; this resulted in a clarion call for safeguarding tribal rights and cultures. Such being the extent of desperation, this naturally resulted in hatred and suspicion and their status is classified as active.

**NLFT**[edit]

TheNational Liberation Front of Tripurawas formed in March 1989.

**ATTF**[edit]

TheAll Tripura Tiger Forcewas formed by local aboriginal tribes in 1990, who were gradually outnumbered both directly and indirectly, even at the cost of being threatened for their survival economically and culturally, not to speak of their being reduced to minority population-wise; their sole aim is the expulsion of allBengali speakingimmigrants from the rest of India and nearby Bangladesh.

Meghalaya[edit]

_Main article:__Insurgency in Meghalaya_

The state ofMeghalayawas separated from the state of Assam in 1971, in order to satisfy theKhasi,SyntengandGarofor a separate state. The decision was initially praised as an example of successful national integration into the wider Indian state.[35]

This, however, failed to prevent the rise ofnational consciousnessamong the local tribal populations, later leading to a direct confrontation betweenIndian nationalismand the newly created Garo and Khasi nationalisms. A parallel rise of nationalism in the other members of theSeven Sister Statesfurther complicated the situation, resulting in occasional clashes between rebel groups.[35]

The state wealth distribution system further fueled the rising separatist movements, as funding is practised through per-capita transfers, which largely benefits the leading ethnic group.[35]

The first militant outfit to emerge in the region was theHynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council(HALC). It was formed in 1992, aiming to protect the interests of Meghalaya's indigenous population from the rise of non-tribal ("Dkhar") immigration.[36]

**HNLC**[edit]

A conflict of interest soon led to a split of the HALC into the Garo-dominatedAchik Matgrik Liberation Army(AMLA), and the joint Systeng-Khasi alliance ofHynniewtrep National Liberation Council(HNLC).[_citation needed_]

**ANVC**[edit]

The AMLA passed into obscurity, while the Achik National Volunteers Council (ANVC) took its place. The Garo-Khasi drift persisted as the HNLC had set up the goal of turning Meghalaya into an exclusively Khasi region; the ANVC, on the other hand, sought the creation of an independent state in the Garo Hills.[36]

**GNLA**[edit]

The most active outfit in the state is the Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA), which was formed in 2009.[37]

A number of non-Meghalayan separatist groups have also operated in the region, including theUnited Liberation Front of Assamand theNational Democratic Front of Bodolandamong others.[38]

Mizoram[edit]

_See also:__March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising_

Mizoram's tensions were largely due to the simmeringAssamesedomination and the neglect of theMizo people. In 1986, theMizo accordended the main secessionist movement led by theMizo National Front, bringing peace to the region.[_citation needed_]Insurgency status is classified as partially active, due to secessionist/autonomy demands by theHmars, Chakmas and Brus.

**HPC-D**[edit]

TheHmar People's Convention-Democracy is an armed insurgency group formed in 1995 to create an independentHmarState in North East India. It is the offspring of the Hmar People's Convention (HPC), which entered into an agreement with the Government of Mizoram in 1994 resulting in the formation of the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) in North Mizoram. Their recruited cadres are from the States where the Hmar people are spread – Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya. The HPC(D) is demanding a separate administrative unit under the SixthSchedule of the Constitution of India
