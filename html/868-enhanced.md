To

 The Assistant Inspector General of Police (Hqrs.)

 Police Headquarters

 Mizoram, Aizawl.

Subj :-  Smuggling of Cattle from Mizoram to Bangladesh - reg.

Ref : No. CB/PHQ/350/BM/2017/215 Dt. 18th Feb. 2020

Sir,

 With reference to the subject and letter No. mentioned above, thorough enquires was conducted by CID(SB) SOs deployed in concern districts and there is no report of recent activities on cattle smuggling to Bangladesh from Mizoram. Further, it was also found during the enquiries that the present supply of cattle in the State is barely sufficient to meet the demands of the local market which makes it more unlikely that there will be any cattle left to be smuggled profitably across the border from Mizoram from the commercial point of view.

 Submitted for kind information and further necessary action, please.

 Yours faithfully,

** (K.LALREMSANGA)**
