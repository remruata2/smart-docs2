****National Security Strategies Conference-2024(13.9.2024, Friday)****

1. **Theme - Counter Terrorism:**

1. **HPCD** : Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MOS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where around 102 (one hundred two) Cadres and 12 (twelve) Council Members of HPC(D) came to over ground at the ceremony. However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and reorganized themselves. They have been indulging in collection of donation and extortion during the years 2022 and 2023.

**Cases registered against HPCD, Lalhmingthanga Sanate Faction (2022 -2024) :**

1. No. of case registered –  31
2. No. of persons arrested  –  09
3. No. of Case disposed – 12
4. Pending Investigation – 19

 Due to its strategic location it cannot be ruled out the possible terrorism or insurgency related activities within the State and several measures to counter the internal security threat have been undertaken:

a) Intelligence sharing and co-ordination for combating terrorism/insurgency.

b) Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC).

c) Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA) Coordination/ Directional Meeting.

1.  **Myanmar issue and refugees** :

******The arm resistance put up by the Civil Disobedience Movement (MDM) in general and armed ethnic groups of Chin State, Myanmar to overthrow the military regime in Myanmar since 1st February 2021 resulted in the influxes of considerable number of refugees particularly the Chin Community into Mizoram. Since the Military Coup, there has been a reported 8 (eight) major influxes of Myanmar Nationals into the State. Leaders of these ethnic groups held a workshop at Aizawl during 7th – 8th Sept.2023 in the goal of forming an interim Government at Chinland .**

 Apart from the Chin community, due to the arm clashes between the State Administration Council’s (SAC) Myanmar Army and Arakan Army in Rakhine State and the subsequent capturing of almost all important cities by the Arakan Army, some communities of Khumi tribe are also seeking shelter into the Southern part of Mizoram reportedly due to the atrocities of the Arakan Army.

1. **Theme-Narcotics**:****

****Introduction:**Mizoram has a long international boundary with two countries (496.53 kms with Myanmar and 319.79 kms with Bangladesh) and 284 kms of inter-state boundaries with three other north-eastern states – Assam, Tripura and Manipur. Interestingly Mizoram lies at the periphery of the Death Triangle formerly Golden Triangle historically known for its drug manufacturing and trade. Mizoram has porous international border****with Myanmar and Bangladesh, the rough terrain, lack of proper connectivity poses a huge challenge to security forces at the border areas, it hampers their movement and limit their ability to check drug trafficking and to rapidly respond attempts made by criminals.**

**Prevailing drug situation in Mizoram:**

 There has been an increase in illegal cross-border drug smuggling in recent years and Mizoram has become a favorable transit route for transporting them to other parts of the country. Major drugs trafficked into Mizoram are heroin, methamphetamine, ganja, pseudoephedrine and codeine based cough syrup. The routes of drugs trafficked in Mizoram are as follows:

1. Heroin is smuggled mainly from Myanmar and Assam for local consumption.
2. Methamphetamine (Yaba tablets) are smuggled from Myanmar through Mizoram for transporting to mainland and neighboring country like Bangladesh.
3. Ganja is smuggled mainly from Manipur and other parts of mainland India for local consumption.
4. There is reverse trafficking of Pseudoephedrine, which are smuggled from mainland India through Mizoram into Myanmar. The smuggled Pseudoephedrine is used for preparation of Methamphetamine and the finished products i.e. Methamphetamine tablets were smuggled back into Mizoram from Myanmar for further distribution in the mainland and Bangladesh.

****The BNU conference held in September, 1997 at Saipuilui village in Mamit District adopted a resolution for creation of Autonomous District Council for Brus in the western part of Mizoram which was strongly objected by the Mizo community in the concerned area. At the same time a militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) which was formed in 1996 under the leadership of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became more and more active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by BNU. Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram at the instance of the BNLF for their operational convenience.

 

The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government.

1. **Bawm/Bangladesh refugee** :-

  A military operation against Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) by Bangladesh Army on 15.11.2022 at Chhaihkhiang Village, Bangladesh resulted in the mass exodus of civilians, mainly the Bawm community during which 272 civilians including women and children fled their villages to take shelter inside Mizoram.

Subsequent military operations led to 3 major influxes of Bawm civilians into Lawngtlai District of Mizoram which briefly halted during the Election process of Bangladesh in January 2024 and the peace talk between the KNA and Bangladesh Government . However, the looting of Banks and arms by KNA on 2nd and 3rd April 2024 resulted in an intensified operation against the KNA leading to more influxes of Bawm community into Mizoram.

The latest Bawm refugees numbering 93 persons who entered Damdep-II Village, Lawngtlai District, Mizoram on the night of 04.07.2024 were evacuated by BSF personnel to Crocodile Camp, Kamtuli in an attempt to deport the refugees.
