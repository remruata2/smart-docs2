Ramhluna, Ex-MLA, the newly appointed Vice Chairman for Industrial Development Board does not have direct or indirect threat from any source at present as well as in the past. He personally felt that urgent provision of PSO might not be necessary since the Industrial Development Board itself do not yet have an office of its own. He further stated that such PSO may be needed by him only after having a permanent office. It is therefore concluded that since there exist no possible enmity/competition for power etc against him and also by considering his own statement, provision of PSO for Pu C. Ramhluna is not urgently necessary for the time being.</span></span></span></span></p>

However, he is being provided one PSO at present that is the permanent residence of Lunglei city. It may be noted that from his statement, Pu Tanpuia indeed wanted to have an additional PSO since he felt that bringing his PSO along (and away from his permanent residence i.e. Lunglei city wherein his family/wife and kids lives) every where he travelled/journeyed around and outside the state was highly tiresome for only one PSO. Apart from the mentioned reason, no other particular ground is found as to why he need an additional PSO. Hence, it is then considered that instead of providing him an additional PSO (which is viewed as unnecessary), his present PSO may be changed by any other officer whi is the residence of Aizawl city.</span></span></span></span></p>
