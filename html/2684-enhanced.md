Subject: ORDER-Temporary suspension of Free Movement Regime (FMR) – regarding

Ref: No. MCID/B-6/2021/495 Dt. 27.10.2022

Sir,

 With reference to the subject and letter No. cited above, I am to state the following regarding temporary suspension of Free Movement Regime (FMR):

1. Residents of villages located along both sides of the border viz. India and Myanmar share genuine ethnic, cultural and economic ties. It may be mentioned that FMR has been implemented with an aims to enhance economic and social interaction between the two countries and also to safeguard traditional rights of largely tribal communities residing along the border, which are accustomed to free movement across land border.

As there has been no report of any serious violation of FMR concerning security of the state, temporary suspension of FMR may result in grave opposition from the local communities residing along the Indo-Myanmar border as well as CYMA, MZP etc.

1. Mizoram Police, Mizoram Excise &amp; Narcotics Department, other sister agencies and local NGOs under the patronage of the state government are taking excessive measures to curb illegal activities such as smuggling of narcotics, contrabands and arms within the state.

1. In connection with illegal entry of Myanmar Nationals into India and also curb cross border illegal activities including smuggling of narcotics, contrabands and arms, it may be mentioned that Assam Rifles has been deployed along the Indo-Myanmar border to prevent the occurrence of the said illegal activities. 

In view of the above, Temporary Suspension of FMR is not recommended. This for kind information and perusal please. 

Yours faithfully,

****(K. LALREMSANGA)****
