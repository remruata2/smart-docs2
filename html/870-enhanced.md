****PRESENT STATUS OF INDO-BANGLA BORDER FENCING****

 Mizoram shares 318 Km long international boundary with Bangladesh. These porous international borders with Bangladesh served as important routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs. The porous border areas have also widely encouraged other criminal activities like abduction/ kidnapping of Indian citizens by Bangladesh based insurgent groups.

  In order to curb the infiltration, smuggling and other anti-national activities from across the Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government has undertaken the construction of fencing along this border.

  The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was 344.41 Km out of which about 70% work have been completed.

 

 According to Mizoram State Boundary Committee, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram are now within Bangladesh side of the border due to irresponsibility of the construction companies who are fencing the Mizoram- Bangladesh border. The Boundary Committee also found that the fences pass through the middle of 20 other villages.

  Border fencing work could not be undertaken along a 60-km stretch in the Dampa Tiger Reserve owing to pending clearances from the National Board of Wildlife, which has demanded that the State transfer of around 1,520 hectares of non-forestland in compensation.

  Mizoram Chakma Development Forum (MCDF) claimed that about 49.7% of the total Chakma population in Mizoram has lost their houses, lands, cultivation fields and others properties due to the ongoing India-Bangladesh border fencing in Mizoram. On 21st April 2006, the State Government constituted a “State Level Co-ordination Committee on Border Fencing” to ensure that the victims received proper compensation and rehabilitation.

  In order to seal the Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government has adopted multi-pronged approach which include construction of fencing, floodlighting, Border Out Posts (BoPs), induction of latest surveillance equipments like Hand Held Thermal Imagers (HHTI), Night vision Goggle/Devices, etc.
