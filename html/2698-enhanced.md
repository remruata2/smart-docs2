****WRITE UP ON MYANMAR REFUGEES****

 Mizoram shares 496.531 kms. of porous International border with Myanmar as per the record of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram. The Indo-Myanmar border posts are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

 Military takeover took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 whendemocratically electedmembers ofMyanmar'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy, were deposed by Myanmar's Military.

 The escalating resistance put up against the military regime by Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) definitely had an impact and permeate the Indo Myanmar boundary, which resulted in influx of a considerable number of refugees arriving and taking shelter in Mizoram and Manipur. Input received stated that CRPH and CDM supporters are adamant and determined to continue their resistance which had shown a new level including armed resistance for their personnel defence. CRPH and CDM had been steadfast in collecting arms and ammunitions as much as possible from the neighboring countries particularly from the state of Mizoram and Manipur. Besides, they are intending to impart wide scale training on handling of arms and weaponry to its youth supporters. However, the training is yet to commenced due to non availability of suitable training ground. To reinforce and strengthen their resistance in a more effective manner against the military regime, Civil Security Defence (CSD), Tahan Civil Defence Force (TCDF) and Kalay Civil Army (KCA) are working together and a larger group Upper Chindwin Peoples Defence Force (UCPDF) was also formed for effective counter measures against the Military regime.

 Meanwhile, it is pertinent to mention that despite the arrival and presence of refugees in Mizoram, the state Government in compliance to the direction of Ministry of Home Affairs in respect of Myanmarese refugees, had not endorsed and facilitated the arrival of Myanmar refugees. However, civil society organizations and NGOs cannot let down these Myanmarese refugees particularly from the Chin/Sagaing Region who shared close ethnicity and cultural affinity with the Mizos. Further, the assistance provided by these NGOs’ confined solely upon arrival of these asylum seekers within the territory of India.

 To enhance and further intensify the efforts of CRPH and CDM in their endeavour against the military regime as well as to restore democracy, several ousted NLD MPs’ have entered and stationed within India via Mizoram and Manipur. These ousted legislators have been approaching several civil societies and NGOs’ and sought their assistance in various ways.

 Many Myanmar refugees presently took shelter in various districts of Mizoram following military coup in Myanmar. These refugees are accommodated in their relatives house and makeshift camps set up by NGOs.

 According to information received, makeshift camps for Myanmar Refugees were constructed at Zawlsei, Vaphai, Farkawn and Chawngtui in Champhai District by their respective NGOs. In Hnahthial District, makeshift camp for refugees were constructed at Thingsai, Bualpui 'H', New Ngharchhip and Cherhlun by respective NGOs.

_SUGGESTIONS_

1. Recently, there was a conflict between leaders of NGO United and MPs  of Myanmar where Pu Pathanga, MP Mathupi even submitted a letter to the  Hon'ble Home Minister, Mizoram due to some misunderstanding between  them regarding utilization of funds. To avert the possibilities of these  kind of misappropriations of funds, a suitable advice/suggestion may be given  to the leaders of these refugees.

2. Refugees who are accommodated in both R.Dengthuama Hall, Mualpui,  Aizawl and BSUP, Sihphir, according to reports, expressed that their main  requirement is adequate ration in their daily life.

3. There are 27 Myanmar MLAs/MPs residing in Aizawl. Some of them  even  rented a house on their own while others jointed their relative in the  City. These  MLAs/MPs are facing accute shortage of funds for basic needs such as House rent  etc. If arrangements could be made for them, it would  relieve their hardship to a great extend.

4. Apart from the refugees accommodated at R.Dengthuama Hall and  BSUP, Sihphir, there are several refugees scattered throughout Aizawl. If these  refugees could be settled in a designated Camps, it will be easier for the  Government to look after  them.

5. Some of the Myanmar MPs/MLA who had fled to Mizoram often  received intimidations and threats through mobile phones from Zomi  Revolutionary Army Cadres. To comfort and instill confidence in them, it  might be helpful if uniformed Mizoram Police personnel visited them at their  residence at a frequent time interval.
