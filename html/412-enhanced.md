Sir,

 Apropos above, since we have no record of the list of HPC(D) cadres at Ankhachhuah designated camp, it is regretted that we are unable to share whether the absentees are involved in any subversive activities inside Mizoram or not. The matter may please be enquired from Manipur Police.

 This is for your kind information.

Yours faithfully,
