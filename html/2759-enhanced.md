Subj  : Threat Perception Report.

Ref : MSB/CB/B-19(A)/925 Dated 30.12.2021

Sir,

 With reference to the letter no. and subject cited above, I hereby submit my assessment of security threat perception report in respect of Pu Vanlalenmawia, Special Judge (Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988).

According to the petitioner, the power vested in him is original criminal jurisdiction with Sessions power, and that the threat perception is no less than the other Hon’ble Judges. Moreover, while previously functioning as Addl. District &amp; Sessions Judge, Aizawl, has awarded harsh sentences in quite a few cases and the present cases in the Court of Special Judge, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, involves influential people, rich and powerful and avoidance of probable untoward incident is necessary.

While conducting an assessment on threat perceived, effort was rendered from different possible angles to ascertain possible threat posed or perceived upon the said person, or even that could emanate due to personal animosity against him. It is concluded that the threat perceived either direct or indirect is minimal at present. The petitioner had not received any threat report from his staff and that he has been provided C/192. Siamkunga, 5th IR as his PSO as per his entitlement

Submitted for favour of information and further necessary action.

 Yours faithfully,

  SI (KC. JOSEPH)
