****SUGGESTED AGENDA POINTS FOR DGsP/IGsP CONFERENCE 2019.****

****Creation of Special Squad in each State for prompt inter-state police co-ordination to fight financial fraud, human trafficking and vehicle theft.****

****Justification:**Development in technology have changed the environment of crime. Criminals have always taken advantage of these new technologies. Today, crimes such as money laundering, credit card fraud, forgery etc. have become a common occurrence. Fraudsters usually operate online either by draining victim’s account and transferring the money to another account or to E-wallet which are used for online transactions for shopping through a computer or a smart phone. Apart from online fraud, such other crimes which require systematic co-ordination among various state police, such as, vehicle theft, human trafficking have also become very common. Hence, it is imperative to set up a mechanism comprising various state police and banks to enable quick action to counter these high-tech crimes which become very rampant in our country.**
