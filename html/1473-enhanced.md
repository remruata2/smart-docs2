**Session II: Demographic changes in bordering - ways for effective border management.**

Mizoram shares international border with Myanmar and Bangladesh. It shares 496.531 kms of unfenced international border with Myanmar, and there are around 30 - 40 small villages scattered in Mizoram side of the Border. It also shares318 Km long international boundary with Bangladesh. These porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh served not only as convenient routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition, to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs, but also for illegal infiltration. The Indo-Myanmar border is guarded by Assam Rifles and Indo-Bangladesh border by Border Security Force (BSF).

The porous international border facilitates ease of illegal infiltration into the state from neighbouring countries and illegal migration has the potential to alter the demographic pattern of the border districts adjoining Bangladesh. It is alleged that the Chakma population in Mizoram has increased disproportionately or abnormally in the last few years mainly due to illegal infiltration from Bangladesh. The total Chakma population of Mizoram is estimated to be more than 100,000 (as per the 2011 census - 96,972 and 2001 census - 71283). The decadal growth rate of Chakma population is 36.03percentduring 2001 to 2011, which is far way higher than the state decadal growth rate during the same period is 22.78 percent (2001-2011).

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

Southern districts of the state viz. Lawngtlai and Lunglei and Mamit in the western district are more vulnerable to illegal infiltration from Bangladesh. So far ,Champhai District having international border with Myanmar has lesser reported cases of illegal infiltration as compared to the above stated districts, but it should not be neglected from the security point of view. A sizeable number of Myanmar nationals are seeking shelter within the state following Military Coup in Myanmar on 1.2.2021 and it should be constantly monitored and their further movement within the state should also be monitored in order to prevent their further retention within the state.

 There has been a large-scale influx of Myanmar refugees into Mizoram after the recent intense fighting between the Chinland Defense Force (CDF) comprising of armed civilians led by Chin National Army (CNA) and Myanmar army at Lungler village, Chin State, Myanmar. Around 400 (four hundred) armed CDF members attacked Myanmar army camp (Lungler Camp manned by 266 Bn. Myanmar Army) on the early morning of 9.9.2021 .The army sent helicopters and jet fighters and launched counter-attack. The aerial attacks could be seen with naked eyes from Thingsai village, Mizoram, located at around 12 (twelve) kms. from the Indo-Myanmar border. CDF again attacked the camp on 10.9.2021 and captured the camp. 1 (one) Myanmar army personnel was killed in the attack and 12 (twelve) were captured and they were lodged at Camp Victoria (CNF Camp), Myanmar.

 8 (eight) nos. of assault rifles, 6 nos. of G-3 automatic rifle, 1 no. of Uzi sub-machine gun, 1 no. of 70mm Mortar, 2 Pistols, 3 Shotguns and huge cache of ammunitions were seized by the CDF. The camp was destroyed and burnt to the ground and 6 (six) CDF members also suffered physical injuries. Lungler villagers and CDF members completely deserted Lungler village after the incident was over.

 Another consequence of this military coup in Myanmar is the increase in the flowing of narcotic substances through the border from Myanmar. This fact may be attributed to the already porous border combined with the over stretched Myanmar military/police personnel guarding the border areas who are engaging in the ever increasing militancy in their state. The amount of No.4(Heroin) seized inside Mizoram after the military coup Myanmar i.e. February - September 2021 is recorded as 4.72 Kgs. which is estimated to be worth Rs.1,53,72,000. ( The figure would have been a lot higher had it not been for the imposition of partial/total lockdown in Mizoram as a result of Covid-19 pandemic).

**Session IV & V : radicalisations and terror funding**

 There is no record in the files of this office about registration of cases related to Radicalization. Further, there is neither no report of cases of financing terrorist nor insurgent/extremist.

**Session VI :****Strategies to deal with the problem of illegal immigrants in the country**

The long porous international border could be a security threat and migration routes for illegal immigrants to Mizoram. In recent year, it has been reported that **over 2,70,000 (two lakhs seventy thousand) Rohingyas refugees entered Bangladesh through border points of Chittagong Division (Bandarban, Rangamati & Khagrachhari Cox Bazar, etc.). As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division, further infiltration of illegal migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.**

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy and Free Movement Regime (FMR) will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

AMilitary Coup in Myanmarbegan on the morning of 1st February 2021, whendemocratically electedmembers of the country'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy(NLD), were deposed by theTatmadaw (Myanmar Army). A sizeable number of Myanmar nationals flee to the neighbouring countries viz. India, Bangladesh and Thailand due to fear of Military persecution following Military takeover. In this connection, scores of Myanmar nationals are also taking shelter in Mizoram.

****It is necessary to explore the possibilities to tackle and check on growing influx of illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh and Myanmar.

1. **Setting up of Border Management Division****:**

Many states in the country are having a separate Border Management Division and considering the strategic location of the state, it is imperative to set up a separate Border Management Division in the State. The state has border with militant infested Countries viz. Bangladesh and Myanmar, and States viz. Manipur, Tripura and Assam and there have been many instances of seizure of Arms, smuggle items viz. Arms, Drugs etc. and report has been received on many occasions regarding use of the state as transit by various militant groups and there have been alleged reported infiltration of illegal Bangladeshi in southern districts of the state. A separate Border Management Division under Home Department/ Police Headquarters should be set up, which will specialize in managing the border.

1. **Cross Border Deliveryby Pregnant Women**_:_

 There have been reported instances in the southern districts of Mizoram that many pregnant women from Bangladesh enter the state on the pretext of seeking medical assistance and giving birth due to poor medical facilities in their area. As the new born baby has to be registered by the Hospital, they can easily get citizenship status of the country by birth. The matter has to be dealt carefully as it can be security threat for facilitating illegal infiltration and compromise Citizenship status in the Country.

1. **Setting Up of Immigration Check Post****:**

 Special attention should be given to districts having international border viz. Mamit District, Champhai District,Lunglei District,Hnahthial, Saitual, Serchhip, Lawngtlai District and Siaha District. The State is conduit for illegal migration due to its long porous international border and ethnicity linked with the bordering countries. The Chakmas/Brus community dominated areas in the southern and western part of the state should be given more focus in respect of illegal infiltration due to its reported abnormal growth rate. Immigration Check Post should be set up in areas which are vulnerable for illegal infiltration. The Immigration Check Post should be set up under the supervision and control of concern District Superintendent of Police. A proper report should be maintained at the Immigration Check Post.

1. **Strengthening of Task Force specially constituted to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram &deportation:**

In order to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram and for their deportation, 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District. These Special Task Forces should be reinforced by making separate budgetary provision, routine meeting etc. for their effective functioning.
