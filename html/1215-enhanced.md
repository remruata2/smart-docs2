Subject: New Version of IED(NTRO) regarding.

Sir,

 I am furnishing input received from MAC Hqrs., New Delhi dt. 19th July 2011 for your information and taking appropriate preventive and precautionary measures.

 The Pakistan based terrorists have devised a new kind of IED concealed in a perfume bottle. This 'new' type of IED will explode if used as normal perfume. These bottles of perfume are likely to be sent through couriers to various government officials as 'gift'.

 All security personnel detailed on personal security duties and on security of government officers should be sensitised and trained to look out for any kind of modified bottles/containers sent as gifts and subject them to thorough checks to ascertain their genuineness.

Yours faithfully,
