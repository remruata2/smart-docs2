They told us to meet somewhere after unloading the consignment. We were having no knowledge about what the consignment was. Then the two Bengali and Mizo persons left by white color Scooty. The next day i.e. dt.26.8.2021, our Truck was unloaded at around 6:30 am the next day.

On reaching Bawngkawn, we waited till 9:30 am, Finally, those two persons came by the same white color scooty and parked the scooty bit far away from out vehicle.
