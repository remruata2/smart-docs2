Subject:  Prayer to take necessary steps towards repair of Zilthawchhuah to Vaitin Road.

Sir,

  I have the honour to bring your kind attention that during 27th to 28th March 2018, officers of CID (SB) led by Dy.SP Pu Malsawma Royte conducted spot verification of Zilthawchhhuah to Vaitin Road which is to be used for transportation of HPC (D) cadres including Council members for the Arms Laying Ceremony scheduled to be held on 12th April 2018 at CTI Sesawng. The verification team reported that the said un-metalled road is in a bad condition and not ideal for plying of vehicles.

  I am therefore, directed to request you to please take necessary steps towards repair of Zilthawchhuah to Vaitin road which is around 17 kms with the concerned division of Public Works Department (PWD), Govt. of Mizoram so that the HPC (D) cadres and Council members could reach CTI Sesawng safely in time for the Arms Laying Ceremony. It has been tentatively decided that the HPC (D) cadres will be brought to CTI Sesawng from Zilthawchhuah on 9th April 2018 and therefore, PWD officals may be requested to complete patch up work of the road on or before 9th April 2018.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
