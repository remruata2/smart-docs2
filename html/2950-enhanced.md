****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/36

Dated: 16th January, 2019.

In continuation of our Special Report vide No. MSB/CB/SR/2019/29, dt. 12.1.2019: Instead of the quoted “W.P.(C) No. 134 of 2016” by the joint Press Release by various Chakma civil society organisations, the Hon’ble Gauhati High Court, Aizawl Bench issued a judgment on W.P.(C) No. 21 of 2017 on 24.8.2018. The Hon’ble High Court then set aside and quashed the eviction order of the Deputy Commissioner, Lunglei District dated 17.12.2015 and further stated that the respondents, i.e. the State Government, however, were not precluded from taking a decision to evict the settlers at Tuichawngchhuah sub-village but if such action is contemplated, the Government will be required to scrupulously follow the mandate of the provisions as provided in the VC Act.

Further, it appeared that the civil society, especially the Mizo Students’ Union (MSU) is not aware of the Hon’ble High Court judgement which set aside and quashed the eviction order of the Government. As such, it could not be ruled out that a Law &amp; Order situation could flare up in the area when the students’ body became aware of the judgment since there has been a report of intention to take stern action by the MSU if the Court passes a judgment in favour of the Chakma inhabitants.

As the Court did not preclude the State Government from taking a decision to evict the settlers at Tuichawngchhuah, an emergency meeting of concerned authorities such as Law &amp; Judicial Department, District Administration of Lunglei and Local Administration Department convened by the Home Department is deemed highly appropriate to work out a solution to the issue to prevent possible Law &amp; Order situation arising out of it.
