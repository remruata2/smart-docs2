Major Gen. Soe Naing Oo declared that they have the fighting ability to carry on (indefinitely?) as it is meaningless to extend the ceasefire if there is no prospect of formal results beyond four months.</span></span></span></span></p>

Soon in a week the United State Wa Army is going to display its full military might to celebrate thirty years of cease fire with the Myanmar Army and imagine China sending. its top representatives from Yunnan to attend the celebrations that would extend for three days. &nbsp;Representatives of all other Ethnic Armed Organisations are going to attend in full strength. &nbsp;So much for the repeated declaration of the Chinese that they will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

The Army Chief was in Beijing for three days and he faithfully praised China as an &ldquo;eternal friend&rdquo; and thanked it for countering international pressure on Rohingya crisis.</span></span></span></span></p>
