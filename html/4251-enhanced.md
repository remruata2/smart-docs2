****At Chief Secretary’s Conference Room, 2nd Floor, MINECO****

**_________________________________________________________**

**Agenda Items related to Mizoram Police**

1. _Comprehensive review of the situation on international border along IBB in the State of Mizoram._
2. _Review of evolving threats on IBB._
3. _Requirement & Preparation of counter measures in case of specific threat along IBB._
4. _To identify the areas requiring augmentation of State Police for greater and sustained role in border protection in coordination with BSF and other agencies._

**Agenda Item 1: Comprehensive Review of the Situation at the International Border Along the IBB in Mizoram**

 Mizoram's 318-km international border with Bangladesh is notably porous, facilitating cross-border activities such as arms smuggling, illegal trade, drug trafficking, and kidnappings by insurgent groups. These issues present substantial security challenges to both the state and the nation.

 In response, the government commenced border fencing along the Mizoram-Bangladesh frontier in 2005, planning a total of 344.41 km of fencing. Currently, about 75% of this project has been completed. However, concerns have arisen with 15 Indian villages reportedly positioned on the Bangladesh side due to construction inaccuracies, while 20 villages are divided by the fence.

 Effective border management is crucial for national security and necessitates coordinated efforts among administrative, security, intelligence, and legal agencies. Precise border demarcation, enhanced fencing quality, and advanced surveillance systems are essential measures required to address these challenges.

 The Indo-Bangladesh border (IBB) in Mizoram is facing significant challenges due to insurgencies, illegal immigration, and refugee crises, primarily stemming from ongoing tensions in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh.

**Agenda Item No.2: Examination of Emerging Threats on the Indo-Bangladesh Border (IBB)**

 The Indo-Bangladesh border in Mizoram is currently facing several significant challenges, primarily due to insurgencies, illegal immigration, and refugee crises. These issues largely stem from the ongoing tensions in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh.

**1. Insurgencies**

The Chittagong Hill Tracts have long been a focal point for ethnic violence and tribal insurgencies. This turmoil has been worsened by the dislocation of Bengali settlers and the presence of military forces. Despite the 1997 peace agreement with the Parbatya Chattogram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS), some dissident groups remain active. The emergence of the Kuki Chin National Front (KNF) and its armed faction, the Kuki Chin National Army (KNA), in 2021 has increased the level of conflict. It is suggested that members of the KNF/KNA and PCJSS may be seeking refuge or conducting activities from Mizoram.

**2. Illegal Immigration**

Past conflicts, such as the construction of the Kaptai Dam and clashes between the Bangladesh Army and Shanti Bahini, have historically led to illegal immigration of Chakma refugees into Mizoram. The recent outbreak of communal violence in the CHT, triggered by the lynching of a Bengali man, has further escalated tensions. Although the Chakma community in Mizoram has protested against the atrocities committed against their brethren in Bangladesh, there have been no reports of new illegal entries.

**3. Refugee influx:**

Military operations against the KNA in Bangladesh have led to multiple influxes of Bawm refugees into Mizoram. Since 2022, over 2000 refugees have sought refuge, with the most recent group arriving in July 2024. The state government has intervened to provide accommodation, underscoring the ongoing humanitarian and security challenges.

On January 7, 2025, 28 Bangladeshi refugees entered Hruitezawl, Lawngtlai District, Mizoram, via Myanmar. After relocation to Tuithumhnar, a joint team repatriated them through Zorinpui on January 11, 2025. Reports suggest they may move to Myanmar instead of returningtoBangladesh.

The evolving threats along the India-Bangladesh Border (IBB) necessitate enhanced border management, intelligence sharing, and humanitarian assistance. Coordinated efforts are essential to addressing insurgency-related activities, preventing illegal immigration, and managing refugee influxes while ensuring the security of (India/Mizoram) and sovereignty of India.

**4. Bangladesh Internal Conflict and Recent Clashes in the Chittagong Hill Tracts**

 The reservation of 30% of government jobs for descendants of freedom fighters in Bangladesh triggered widespread protests. On August 5, 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country, and an interim government led by Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus was formed to restore order.

 On September 18, 2024, tensions escalated in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) when a Bengali man was lynched by a mob of Chakma and Marma communities in Khagrachhari District. This incident sparked violent clashes between Bengali settlers and indigenous minorities, resulting in three deaths and widespread destruction of Chakma homes.

 In Mizoram, the Chakma community, under the Central Young Chakma Association, held a protest rally on September 22, 2024, demanding Indian intervention. Approximately 2,500 participants expressed solidarity through rallies and candlelight vigils.

 Despite heightened vigilance by border forces and state police, no illegal entry of Chakma refugees into Mizoram has been reported. However, the situation highlights the ongoing ethnic tensions and humanitarian concerns in the region.

**Agenda Item No.3 Requirement & Preparation of counter measures in case of specific threat along IBB.**

At the India-Bangladesh border, three battalions of the Border Security Force (BSF) are currently deployed. Additionally, the state government has stationed the Mizoram Police, including personnel from the Mizoram Armed Police (MAP) and India Reserve Battalions (IR Bn.), along the border to support the central armed forces.

**Major Initiatives for Effective Border Management :**

**(i) Fencing of the India-Bangladesh Border :**

 The construction of the India-Bangladesh border fence began in Mizoram in 2005. The total proposed length of the fence along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border is 344.41 kilometers, of which approximately 75% has been completed.

 The Mizoram State Boundary Committee has reported that, due to the negligence of the companies responsible for the construction, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram now fall on the Bangladeshi side of the border. Additionally, the committee discovered that the fencing bisects 20 other villages.

 Border fencing has yet to be initiated along a 60-kilometres section within the Dampa Tiger Reserve. This delay is due to pending approvals from the National Board of Wildlife, which requires the state to provide about 1,520 hectares of non-forest land as compensation before granting clearance.

**(ii) Border Roads**

Along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border, 303.97 kilometers of border patrol roads have been constructed out of an approved total length of approximately 602.28 kilometers.

**(iii) Border Outposts (BOPs)**

Of the 91 approved BSF Border Outposts (BOPs), construction has been completed for 18 BOPs. The remaining 73 BOPs are yet to be established along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border. Additionally, Mizoram Police have deployed security personnel from the Indian Reserve Battalion (IR Bn) along the Indo-Bangladesh border, particularly on the western side of Mamit District, Mizoram.

****(iv) Special Task Force (STF)****

To identify and deport illegal immigrants from Bangladesh settling in Mizoram, three Special Task Forces (STFs) have been established in the Lunglei, Mamit, and Lawngtlai districts as directed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STF is led by the Deputy Commissioner of the respective district.

**(v) Recovery of Arms and Ammunition:**

As a result of persistent efforts by the Mizoram police over the past two years (2015-2025), a total of 63 sophisticated weapons and approximately 18262 rounds of ammunition have been confiscated from various arms smugglers and insurgent groups operating along the Indo-Bangladesh border.

**Counterfeit Currency / Drug Smuggling / Arms Smuggling :**

**(a) Counterfeit Currency (FICN):** There have been no reported incidents of smuggling or seizure of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) across the Indo-Bangladesh border within Mizoram.

**(b) Drugs:** While there is no reported smuggling of narcotic drugs from Bangladesh into Mizoram, the smuggling of narcotic drugs, particularly methamphetamine tablets (known locally as Yaba tablets), from Myanmar into Bangladesh through Mizoram cannot be entirely ruled out.

**(c) Arms Smuggling**: There have been confirmed reports of arms being smuggled from Myanmar to Bangladesh, especially following the takeover of Myanmar army camps by resistance forces. This was validated during the recent interrogation of an accused individual arrested on September 17, 2024, in connection with BKN Police Station Case No. 302/24, dated September 17, 2024, under Section 25(1A)/25(1AA) of the Arms Act and read with Section 14 of the Foreigners Act. This case involved the Mizoram Police seizing 1,000 rounds of live 7.62mm ammunition at Zuangtui, Aizawl.

**(d) **Recent Arms and AmmunitionSeizure :**On January 15, 2025, a joint operation conducted by the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau (SIB) and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Special Branch of Mizoram resulted in the seizure of arms and ammunition in local market rate worth â‚¹62,17,500 on the outskirts of Saithah village, within the jurisdiction of the West Phaileng Police Station in Mamit District. The recovery included 6(six) AK-47 rifles valued at â‚¹27,00,000; 10,050 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition valued at â‚¹35,17,500; and 13 magazines (of which 11 were empty and 2 were loaded). Consequently, West Phaileng Police Station Case No. 2/2025, dated January 15, 2025, was registered under Section 61(2)(a) of the BNS Act, read with Sections 13, 16, 18, 20, and 23 of the UAPA, Section 25(1AA) of the Arms Act, and Section 14A of the Foreigners Act.**

Based on intelligence inputs, the operation led to the arrest of five individuals, including a senior leader of the Chin National Front (CNF), a rebel group from Myanmar. Investigations uncovered that the weapons were destined for the United People's Democratic Front (Prasit Group), a militant organization active in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts. This operation highlights the Mizoram Police's dedication to dismantling cross-border smuggling networks and maintaining regional security.

****Agenda Item No. 4: Identifying Areas for Enhancing State Police to Strengthen Border Protection Coordination with BSF and Other Agencies****

****Enhancing State Police for Border Protection****

To bolster security along the international borders through Mizoram, it is recommended to implement the following strategies:

****1. Establishment of a State Border Protection Force:** The State Police should be expanded to incorporate a specialized State Border Protection Force or Battalion. This force will effectively address issues related to illegal immigration, smuggling, and ethnic identification which present challenges to the central Border Guarding Forces (BSF).**

**2. Infrastructure Development:** The Commercial Vehicle Terminal at Tlabung, inaugurated in 2023, requires immediate staffing to become operational. Improving police capabilities, infrastructure, and coordination with the BSF and central agencies will ensure effective border management and security.

**3. Legalization of Border Trade:** Legalizing border trade, particularly at Tlabung in Lunglei District, can stimulate the economy and reduce smuggling activities. However, the Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Kawrpuichhuah, Lunglei district remains inactive due to insufficient manpower and infrastructure. While positions for police personnel were created in 2022, they have not yet been filled.

**4. Biometric Registration System:** Implementing biometric registration for refugees and border traders will facilitate accurate monitoring. Refugees may be accommodated temporarily until stability is restored in their home countries. The Mizoram Home Department has requested adjustments to the Foreigner's Identification Portal (FIP) to permit refugee stays, but a response from the Union Home Ministry is still pending.
