Ref:- CMO/SEC/COR/09/23 dt. 25/3/09.

Sir,

 With reference to above, I am sending hereby reports on the CM’s remarks as under for your information and necessary action.

 At present about 20 (twenty) SPLO cadres under the command of SS Gen.Secy. H.T.Khawzawl and SS Lt. Rohluna Hrangchal @ Ignou are staying at Khawmawi in Churachandpur under HNA patronage .

 The HNA, as also HPC(D) and various other tribal underground groups are having an Suspension of operation agreement with the Army . It is learnt that the Army is controlling movement of these underground group , restricting their respective area of operations within which they can move freely . The SPLO, as a newly formed organisation who does not have the Suspension of operation agreement are sheltered and looked after by the HNA as they are in friendly terms with each other presumeable because of their having a common rival i.e. HPC(D) .

 These 20 cadres under the command of SS Lt.Rohluna were released from the UPPK Training Camp during Dec/2008. and about 80 cadres are still staying in the Camp near Tamu, Myanmar. Information received through sources indicated that the remaining appx. 80 cadres are still detained in the UPPK Camp as their leader could not pay the fees. The UPPK were also learnt to have agreed to supply some weapons to the SPLO which could not as yet materialize as the SPLO did not have enough money . Intelligence deduced from sources information indicated that the SPLO are now desperately trying to launch extortion drive as their priority target.

 It may be recalled that SS Gen.Secy. H.T.Khawzawl had been with Hmingchungnunga while the later was on hiding , and later joined up with SS Lt.Rohluna’s group at Khawmawi after Hmingchungnunga’s return to Aizawl.

 The rest of 3 UPPK leaders in Aizawl on 9..1.09 had resulted in untrust between Chinglemba @ Shanti SS Chairman of UPPK and Lienzama Hrangchal which had further resulted in complete idisarray in the fledgling SPLO . Though Lianzama Hranchal somehow managed to rebuilt friendship with Chinglemba recently , his Gen.Secy H.T.Khawzawl who has been commanding the cadre in Churahcnadpur got frusutrate with the State of affairs they were in , and often criticized his Chairman for neglecting them.

 It is learnt that Chawngthavunga @ C.T.Sungte , former SS PRO of SPLO had since defected to HPC(D) had secretly been making effort to persuade H.T.Khawzawl to join HPC(D) . It is also learnt that Lienzama Hrangchal had even expressed his displeasure to H.T.Khawzawl upon learning about his conduct. H.T.Khawzawl is learnt to submissive to his Chairman but persisted to criticized him, and even hinted to assume factional leadership in the absence of Lianzama Hrangchal.

 Yours faithfully,
