**ENQUIRY REPORT ON LETTER SENT TO THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA BY HMINGA PA**

 The signatory of the letter, who claimed himself as ‘Hminga Pa’ is none other than Mr. V.Lalfakzuala of Govt. Complex, Aizawl. He is a former Sub-ordinate police officer of Mizoram Armed Police who was granted voluntary retirement on 2015 because of his mental problems.

 Discreet enquiry on the matter was conducted and it was revealed that this person, V.Lalfakzuala, alias, Hminga Pa cannot be treated as a normal person and so is his letter to the President of India because of the below mentioned points –

1) The accusation of committing adultery by V.Lalfakzuala’s wife (his wife) is totally baseless as his evidence is only his vision received from God, according to him. None of his relatives, neighbours, etc. could agreed with him.

2) Due to his Psychosis problems, treatment was given to him by Dr. C.Lalhrekima on 25.8.2015 at Civil Hospital, Aizawl from which he could not recover fully till date. His own father, Mr.V.Lalsiama even admitted this fact.

3) There is no such senior male nurse as Mr. John in Synod Hospital, Durtlang, Aizawl as mentioned in his letter. The nearest to such name is Mr.Johny Laltanpuia, Fourth Year student, who already died on 26.4.2017 because of Kidney failure – about four (4) months before the incident claimed by V.Lalfakzuala in his letter.

4) To the astonishment of nurses of Synod Hospital, Durtlang, Aizawl, Mr.V.Lalfakzuala claimed that till today, several nurses of Synod Hospital are having an affairs with him which is a clear indicator of his mental disorder. His family members and community are also aware of his mental problem.

Conclusion : During the period of his hospitalization in Synod Hospital, Durtlang, Mr.V.Lalfakzuala was having great affection/fondness of the nurses of this hospital. It seems that having mental disorder, this fondness and jealousness resulted in him writing his imagination which was sent to the President of India.
