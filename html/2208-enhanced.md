****Subject: Submission of Memorandum for implementation of Khawzawl District.****

Sir,

With profound respect, We, the Khawzawl District Implementation Demand Committee, on behalf of the people of Khawzawl Town and its surrounding areas who have been constantly with us whole heartedly in demanding the implementation of Khawzawl District would like to bring our humble prayer for the implementation of Khawzawl District to your kind notice and for favour of your kind consideration.

That sir, we have been enthusiastically and eagerly awaiting and expecting the full implementation of Khawzawl District with Khawzawl as its Headquarters from the past two decades. But all our expectations and hopes for the full functioning of Khawzawl Town have not yet been accomplished till date. At the same time, this relentless and inevitable hopes and expectations of the people have been still living. That is why; we would therefore bring to your kind notice our willingness and enthusiasm for the implementation of our said District for your kind consideration through this Memorandum.

In this Memorandum, we enclose the information, particulars and our potentials which are purportedly being in consideration for the implementation of Khawzawl District.

In the premises thereof, we, the Khawzawl District Implementation Demand Committee do hereby humbly submit our Memorandum for your kind consideration and necessary action.
