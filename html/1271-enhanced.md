****Brief note on Bru militants and HPC 'D'****

 Mizoram can boast as the most peaceful state in India and often termed as an island of peace mainly due to the absence of militant outfit. In fact the Mizoram Police is giving the price of keeping Mizoram a peaceful state during the last many years and is effectively dealing with militant outfits operating from the neighboring states However, this does not necessarily mean that Mizoram is free of insurgent and militant activities. Following are some of them:-

1. **HPC 'D'** :- The Hmar People Convention (Democratic) was formed in 1996 by a section of the then HPC led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate who were disgruntled with the terms of Peace Accord signed on 27th July, 1994 by Mizoram Govt. and HPC. HPC(D) has its Headquarter at Hmarkhawlian (Lakhipur) in Cachar District of Assam and designated camp at Sibapurikhal (Ankhachhuah) in Churachandpur District of Manipur. The strength of the outfit is estimated to be 250-300 (ie. Civil and Army wing). They claimed themselves as having 200 arms of different types.

 The Suspension of Operation (SoO) was signed between the Govt. of Mizoram and the HPC(D) on 11th November, 2010 and Peace Talk was held on the same day at State Guest House, Aizawl. However, second round of Peace Talk has been suspended due to inclusion of HPC(D) under the United Peoples' Front (UPF),a combined Manipur based insurgent outfits viz.1) Hmar People's Convention (Democratic)(HPC-D) 2)Kuki National Front(Thangboi faction) KNF(T) 3) Zomi Revolutionary Organisation/Army(ZRO/ZRA) 4) United Kuki Liberation Front(UKLKF) 5) Zomi Defence Volunteer(ZDV) 6) Kuki Revolutionary Army(KRA) which is currently having SoO with the Manipur Government.

**2. BRU/BRA** :- The Bru Revolutionary Union or Bru Revolutionary Army was formed by few remnants of the erstwhile Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM) who refused to come overground in 2006. They are more like an armed gang rather than a well organised militant group. Their strength is estimated to be around 35 and are in possession of the following weapons:

 1) AK-47 -3nos. Ammns -250 rds.

 2) M-16 -1 no. Ammns -180 rds.

 3) G-2 -1 no. Ammns -125 rds.

 4) G-4 -1no. Ammns -150 rds.

 7) Lathode -1 no. 7 bombs.

 8) Chinese Grenade -5 nos.

 9) IED  -3 nos.

 10) Communication Set -5 nos.

 Their operational area is the western belt of Mizoram bordering Tripura and Assam states and do not have permanent camp or hideout. The outfit at present called themselves Bru Federal Army (BFA).

**3. UDLA** :- The United Democratic Liberation Army was formed in 2005 by splinter group of United Liberation Front of Barak Valley (ULFBV) led by Doinoram Reang(Bru clan). Like the BRU/BRA, they are merely an armed gang operating in certain areas of Cachar and Hailakandi districts of Assam. Their source of fund is forced collection/extortion either from Bru or non-Bru families or also from company workers in their areas of operation. Their strength is estimated at about 60-70 (Army and Civil) and are in possession of the following weapons:

 1) AK-47 -2 nos.

 2) SLR -2nos.

 3).303 Rifle -10 nos.
