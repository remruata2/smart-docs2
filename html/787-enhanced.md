****PARBATYA CHATTAGRAM JANA SAMHATI SAMITI(PCJSS)****

  **Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS)** which means United People’s Party of the Chittagong Hill Tract is a political party formed to represent the people and indigenous tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. It has an Armed Group called Shanti Bahini(Peace Corps). It is considered as insurgent group in Bangladesh. The Shanti Bahini is made out of mostly members from the Chakma tribe. The Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord was signed between Bangladesh Government and PCJSS on 2nd December 1997. The major objectives of the peace accord were:

a) Protection of land rights of the hill people.

b) Stimulation of their cultural uniqueness.

c) Rehabilitation of internally displaced people and refugees who had left their country.

d) Withdrawal of the military from the CHT(Chittagong Hill Tracts) with exception of permanent military establishments.

e) Self Government through regional and district councils.

  The PCJSS accused Bangladesh Government that the peace accord agreements are yet to be implemented despite more than 20 years had lapsed since the signing of the Peace Accord. Hence, their armed wing is still in operation and some of their armed cadres are in operation from Mizoram (Tlabung Sub-Division).
