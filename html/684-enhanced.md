To

 The Director General of Police

 Mizoram, Aizawl

Sir,

 Reference to your letter No. DGP/PPS-MISC/2009/932 Dt. 25th November, 2009, I beg to submit a detail report about the BRU for kind perusal please.

 The existence or otherwise of a Bru militant organisation by the name of “Bru Revolutionary Union” is not known to this unit until a note written in the letter head bearing Bru Emblem was left on the dead body of Zarzokima on that fateful day of 13th November, 2009. During early 2006 there was difference in ideology within the BLFM leadership as they tried to regroup after the NLFT had driven them out of their Bangladesh base camp. While the other leaders wanted to reestablish base camp inside Bangladesh, the s/s President Vanlalliana was opposed to the idea and was learnt to have suggested seeking help/shelter from the DHD in Assam in the name of Bru Revolutionary Union (BRU) which did not materialize as he alongwith other 3 hardcore BLFM were arrested in a joint ops by CID (SB) and 36 AR on 20.4.2006 and eventually detained in C/J.

 It may be noted, however, that notwithstanding the subsequent surrender of BLFM, one factional group of BLFM led by s/s Lt. Vanlalfela had since been sheltered by the DHD (N) at their camp located near Halflong. This group numbering approx. 20-30 cadres were reportedly regtd. as cadres of DHD (N) and not as a separate entity, as the DHD (N) were under ceasefire (or SoO) agreement with the Govt. It may also be noted that no undesireable activities of this group inside Mizoram has been noticed during the past 2/3 years except their helping of the DHD cadres in smuggling of weapons.

 Apart from the above records, intelligence inputs shared at recent SMAC meeting on 20.10.09 indicated that some 20 Bru Youths had undergone training under ZRA patronage, and movement of an armed ug group suspected to be of this Bru militants from Manipur border towards Tripura was also noticed recently.

 It was also highlighted in our special report No. MSB/CB/SR/09/900 Dt. 30.10.09 Bru militant groups were undergoing training under one Manipur Militant base outfit which could possibly the BRU which manifested recently.

 Another reliable information received indicated that two Bru militants who had undergone training at ZRA camp in Songtal, Churachandpur, Manipur had recently ran away with one SLR and one G-3 rifle with 241 rounds of ammunitions and 5 magazines, and surrendered at 10 AR’s C-Coy out post at Mimbung on the night of 12.11.09.

Yours faithfully,

Superintendent of Police
