**Blockade of illegal goods from Myanmar:** Champhai District Lirthei Inzawmkhawm Pawl (CPDLIP), a conglomerate of vehicular organisation in Champhai District organised an indefinite blockade of all of goods imported from Myanmar without following the legal procedure along with the transportation of goods out of Champhai town.

 Leaders of CPDLIP stared that they considered prohibition of import of only illegal dry areca nuts as an attempt to show partiality towards residents of Champhai District. Their main intention is to be able to conduct trans-border trade freely under proper legal procedure, they added.
