Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, I am to state that discreet enquiry had been conducted to find out the veracity of the Names/Address and Location of insurgent camps, miscreants of Chittagong Hill Tracts as mentioned in the letters. However, so far, neither such miscreants nor any insurgent camps mentioned in the above letters have been found within the state, and efforts are still underway to find such miscreants and insurgent camps and findings, if any will be communicated to you at the earliest.

 This is for your kind information and further necessary action please.
