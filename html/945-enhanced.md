****BRU REPATRIATION PROCESS****

Mizoram and Central Government devised plans to repatriate the Bru refugees to Mizoram several times without much success. Ministry of Home Affairs has set the deadline for Repatriation of Bru refugees latest by 30th September, 2019.There were 1,681 families (8,869 members) repatriated during 1st to 8th Batch (i.e. 2010 to 2018). And, 280 families (1098 members) were repatriated during 9th Batch and Final of repatriation process (ie, 3.10.2019 - 30.11.2019).

****ISSUES AFFECTING THE SUCCESS OF BRU REPATRIATION****

**1.** Different organizations of Mizoram insisted on repatriating Mizoram Brus origin only, which can be traced from the records of **Mizoram Electoral Roll, 1995** and their genuine descendants.

**2.** Educated and enlightened leaders of Brus, insisted at all cost, to prevent the repatriation as they are benefited by their fellow Brus being given a refugee status. Donations/contributions so collected amounted to huge amount which are worth something greatly desirable by those in high position. Hence, demanding various points completely unacceptable by Mizo community and even the Government, most notably having Autonomous District Council of Brus.

****3.** While these are the purviews of both the Brus and the Mizo communities, solving the Bru Crisis is an important agenda for the Central Government as the Brus, who have settled in Mizoram (India) before Independence have to be considered as Indian Citizens with Minority Status in the State of Mizoram.**

**4.** In protest of the ongoing repatriation process and demand for the implementation of their various grievances, Bru people living in Tripura Transit Camps held a Mass Rally on 21.10.2019 between 8:30 a.m and 3:00 p.m which was jointly organized by four (4) Bru NGOs, viz. i) Mizoram Bru Displaced People Forum (MBDPF), ii) Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement (MBIDM), iii) Bru Tribal Development Society (BTDS) and iv) Bru Displaced Women Welfare Committee (BDWWC). The rally was held between Gachiram Para and Kumboltila (near Dasda Market) wherein about 3,000 (three thousand) people participated. The participants displayed their demands in placards and chanted slogans during the rally. Some of the slogans, inter alia, are :-

1. We want to construct our house in Mizoram prior to repatriation
2. Ongoing repatriation is forceful, not peaceful.
3. We want immediate ‘Interlocutor’ for solution of displaced Brus.
4. Repatriation after Solution.

 Representatives of the NGOs submitted their Memorandum addressed to Shri. Amit Shah, Hon’ble Union Home Minister through SDM Office, Kanchanpur after the rally. In the Memorandum, they reiterated their various demands that they had already raised before. They have added 2 (two) new demands which are :-

1. Removal of Dampa Tiger Wildlife Sanctuary for the resettlement of Brus.
2. Formation of ‘Permanent Development Project’ exclusively for the Brus in Mizoram.

 They further demanded the Government of India to immediately address the following demands :-

1. Demanded the Central Government to release free ration and cash dole immediately.
2. Demanded Mizoram Government to stop sending vehicles to the relief Camps until and unless the displaced Brus are able to repatriate after the solution of their demands.

 Information received indicated that NGOs will not accept the ongoing repatriation process unless their demands are implemented by the Government.

**5.** A Joint Press Handout was issued by BDTS, MBIDM and MBDPF on 21.11.2019 in which the following 2 (two) bottom-line demands were scaled down from the previous 8 (eight) demands :-

i) To resettle the displaced Brus in Dampa Sanctuary as it is the place where the  Brus  had been living since time immemorial past before the declaration of  sanctuary in 1986.
ii) Formation of Permanent Development Project exclusively for the Brus in  Mizoram for their socio-economical, educational and political development.
