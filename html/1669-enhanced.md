****BACKGROUND NOTE OF HPC(D)****

Hmar People's Convention-Democratic (HPC-D) is an offshoot of the Hmar People's Convention (HPC), which came into existence in 1986, as a political party spearheading a movement for self-government in the north and northeast of Mizoram.

In 1992, HPC representatives and the Government of Mizoram mutually agreed to hold ministerial level talks. Consequent to 13 (thirteen) rounds of such talks, a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed at the Mizoram capital Aizawl on July 27, 1994, for establishing the 'Sinlung Hills Development Council' and subsequently, 331 HPC militants surrendered along with their arms. However, dissatisfied with the implementation process, a section of the cadres parted ways with the over ground HPC and formed the HPC-D in 1996.

The main aims and objective of the HPC(D) is to create Autonomous District Council in Hmar tribe inhabited areas in north and north-western part of Mizoram bordering Manipur and Assam states.

**Grounds for banning of HPC(D) as Unlawful Association:**

(i) HPC(D)leaders/activists have been indulging in acts of intimidation, extortion and forceful donations from civilian population for raising funds for their organization in different parts of Mizoram.

(ii) Holding secret meetings, making strategies to induct new members, working in tandem with like-minded other insurgent groups of the North Eastern Region for carrying out acts of extortion and intimidation.

(iii)  HPC(D) has taken up arms to achieve their objective.

(iv) HPC(D) has been attacking the Police, Government employees and law-abiding citizens of Mizoram.
