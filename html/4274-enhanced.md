****NOTES ON SECURITY SCENARIO IN MIZORAM****

1. **Introduction:**

Mizoram faces unique security challenges due to its geographical location. It is sandwiched between two foreign countries, Myanmar and Bangladesh, and shares borders with neighbouring states like Manipur, Assam, and Tripura, which have experienced instances of militancy. Consequently, heightened vigilance is necessary in all border areas.

Mizoram has a 496.531 km-long international border with Myanmar and a 319.791 km-long border with Bangladesh. The international border, although somewhat porous, is occasionally exploited by various insurgent groups for arms smuggling and the transit of militants.

**2. Influx of Myanmar Refugees:**

 Mizoram shares 496.53 Kilometres of unfenced international border with Myanmar while the Free Movement Regime (FMR) allows people along the border of the adjoining countries to enter 16 Kilometres into the neighbouring country without a Visa. Hence, smugglers and militant are taking advantage of this FMR to infiltrate into Mizoram.

 The military coup of 1st February 2021in Myanmar and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) resulted in the influxes of considerable number of Myanmar nationals in general and Chin community in particular seeking asylum and taking shelter in Mizoram. The number of Myanmar nationals taking refuge in Mizoram is as follows:

| **Sl.No** | **District** | **Total Numbers** **of Refugees** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Aizawl | 3306 |
| 2 | Champhai | 12209 |
| 3 | Hnahthial | 1097 |
| 4 | Khawzawl | 125 |
| 5 | Kolasib | 138 |
| 6 | Lawngtlai | 5701 |
| 7 | Lunglei | 2034 |
| 8 | Mamit | 356 |
| 9 | Saitual | 125 |
| 10 | Serchhip | 509 |
| 11 | Siaha | 7872 |
| **TOTAL** |  | **33,472** |


As desired by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Government of Mizoram Home Departmentis currently collecting biometric data of these Myanmar Nationals. On June 22, the MHA asked Mizoram and Manipur to complete the biometric exercises of Myanmar nationals by September 15, which however is unlikely to be completed. These refugees presently took shelter in various districts of Mizoram and are accommodated in their relative’s houses and makeshift camps set up by local NGOs. According to the latest information received, there are 166 makeshift camps for Myanmar refugees in 7 Districts of Mizoram with Siaha District having the highest number of relief camps with 50 relief camps in the district.

| **Sl.No** | **District** | **No of Relief Camp** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Aizawl | 5 |
| 2 | Lunglei | 8 |
| 3 | Siaha | 50 |
| 4 | Champhai | 39 |
| 5 | Kolasib | Nil |

| 8 | Mamit | 2 |
| 9 | Saitual | Nil |

| 11 | Hnahthial | 26 |
| **TOTAL** |  | **166** |


**2(a) Repercussion of influx of refugees from Myanmar on MLA Election in Mizoram:**

 Influx of Myanmar refugees in large numbers adversely impacted their relatives who shelter them and the State Government socio-economically. The increase in the number of thefts and robberies could also be attributed to the large number of unemployed refugees. The possibility of Law and Order due to internal feuds between the permanent resident of Mizoram and the refugees could not be ruled out on issues like issuance of birth certificate or other documents to these refugees. Another evident consequence of the escalating situation of Myanmar and the influx of refugees is the increase in the amount of narcotics substances seized by law enforcement agencies. The reasons for these increase may be attributed to the decline in the number of military check gates on the Myanmar side and the refugees themselves acting as a peddlers/dealers of these contrabands to support themselves and their families financially as most of these refugees are unemployed in Mizoram or had quit their job in Myanmar. Few cases had been registered against Myanmar Refugees for obtaining of fake/unauthorised Adhaar card, PAN card, vehicle registration card, voters’ identity card etc. illegally. In most of these cases the culprit(s) have already been sent to Judicial Custody.

**3. Indo-Bangladesh Border and Bangladesh Refugees:**

 The joint military operation against Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) by Bangladesh Army and Arakan Army (AA) which commenced on 15.11.2022 at Chhaihkhiang Village, Bangladesh had resulted in the mass exodus of civilians, mainly the Bawm community within Chhaihkhiang and its adjoining villages into Mizoram. As many as 272 civilians (mostly Bawm tribe) including women and children of Sunsong, Salopui and Chhaihkhiang villages of Bangladesh had fled their villages to take shelter inside Mizoram. On 20.11.2022 at 4:00pm they arrived at Bandukbanga village, Lawngtlai District wherein residents of the village and BSF personnel provided food/relief to them.

 After the clashes intensified, much more civilians had fled their villages and proceeded toward Mizoram. However, the BSF personnel posted in the border areas refused them entry into Mizoram. This had resulted into NGOs’, student bodies and civil society organization condemning the BSF.

 On 09.01.2023 @ 12:00 noon a Sit-in demonstration was organized at Raj Bhavan North Gate in solidarity for the suffering of Mizo brethren in Bangladesh under the aegis of Central Young Mizo Association (CYMA) wherein The sit-in demonstration passed a resolution that the Indian government should take necessary action for the safety of asylum seekers from Bangladesh and to provide their basic needs. Similar Sit-in demonstration was organized by YMA District Headquarters at the same time at Lunglei, Champhai, Kolasib, Mamit, Hnahthial, Serchhip, Saitual.

 Since then many more Zo-ethnic civilians mainly from Bawm community continues to enter Mizoram from several border points despite the BSF determined attempt to push them back and temporarily resides within Lawngtlai District.

 Summary of Bangladesh Nationals residing in relief camp in Lawngtlai District as on 28.08.2023 is as under:

| **Sl. No.** | **Locality** | **Relief Camp** | **No of Person** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Parva-III | Make shift hut | 233 |
|  | Vathuampui | Make shift hut | 296 |
|  | Mautlang | Make shift hut | 66 |
|  | Chamdur P-I | Make shift hut | 120 |
|  | Hmawngbu | Make shift hut | 101 |
|  | Bungtlang South | Make shift hut | 82 |
|  | Hruitezawl | Make shift hut | 75 |
|  | Hmunnuam | Make shift hut | 30 |
|  | Tuithumhnar | Make shift hut | 109 |
|  | **Total** | **9** | **1112** |


**3(a) Possible repercussion of influx of refugees from Bangladesh on MLA Election in Mizoram:**

Influx of refugees from Bangladesh into southern part of Mizoram can occur anytime depending on the incident of clash between KNA and Bangladesh Army backed AA. Though there is no threat perceived from these refugees, but it appears that some active cadres of KNA also used Mizoram to seek refuge. Seizure of arms, ammunitions and explosives substances by Security personnel in southern Mizoram also have connection with KNA. Therefore, security has to be beefed up in southern Mizoram bordering to Bangladesh during the upcoming GAE 2023.

**4. Impact of Manipur violence in Mizoram:**

The recent Manipur violenceis an ongoing ethnic clash between themajority Meiteisandtribals, who are mainlyKuki tribes. The violence erupted on 3rd May 2023 and it began inChurachanpur district during the "Tribal Solidarity March" called by the All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM) to protest against granting of Scheduled Tribe status to the majority Meitei community.

**4(a) Influx of Internally Displaced People:**

 Due to the ethnic violence in Manipur and the resultant burning of houses and churches belonging to Zo ethnic people in Imphal and villages inhabited by Zo ethnic people in the valley, Zo-ethnic people started entering into Mizoram to seek asylum in different parts of Mizoram soon after the violence began.****These Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are accommodated in community halls/town halls arranged by Village Level Refugee Relief Committee according to conveniences while others who are having relatives and families in Mizoram are hosted by their families/relatives. In some places, efforts are being taken to create Village Level Refugee Relief Committee with Village Council President of each village as Chairman and Branch YMA President as its Vice Chairman. The number of IDPS seeking refuge in Mizoram is as below:
****IDPs FROM MANIPUR UPDATED AS ON 23.08.2023 @ 5:00 P.M.****

| **Sl.No.** | **Name of District** | **Nos. of Relief Camp** | **Nos. of IDPs inside Relief Camp** | **Nos. of IDPs outside Relief Camp** | **Total** |

**4(b) Exodus of Meitei from Mizoram:**

 Due to the solidarity rally and procession scheduled to be organise by NGOCC on 25th July, 2023 across Mizoram, Meitei community living in Aizawl who are mainly engaged in tailoring, auto mechanics, Government servants, etc. and Meitei students pursuing their studies in various institutions like Mizoram University; RIPANS; College of Veterinary Science &amp; Animal Husbandry Selesih; Central Horticulture College, Thenzawl; ZMC, etc. had started leaving Mizoram since 22nd July, 2023 in large number, due to fear of violence that might have cause by the procession. The Press Release issued by Peace Accord MNF Returnees' Association (PAMRA), General Headquarters, Aizawl issued on 21.07.2023 had also cause fear among the Meitei living in Mizoram. In the Press Release, PAMRA advises the Meitei living in Mizoram to leave Mizoram for their own safely and stated that the safety of the Meitei will solely depends on themselves. The number of Meitei who had left Mizoram since 22nd July, 2023 as recorded by Police Department is 673 (238 by flight and 435 by road). However, many Meiteis had already returned back to Mizoram after the procession organized by NGOCC was conducted peacefully.

**4(c) Solidarity march/procession organised by NGOCC:**

Consequence upon the Manipur violence and the alleged ethnic cleansing drive conducted against Zo ethnic people by Manipur Government, NGO Coordination Committee (NGOCC) organised a solidarity rally and procession on 25.07.2023 @11:00 a.m. in Aizawl and difference part of the state. As many as 40,000 (forty thousand) people participated in the solidarity march/rally in Aizawl. The solidarity march/rally was also observed in 75 (seventy five) cities, towns and villages across the 11 (eleven) districts of the state. All the solidarity rallies in different parts of the state ended peacefully without any law and order issues.

**4(d) Possible repercussion of Manipur violence on 2023 MLA Election in Mizoram**

It is evident that Manipur violence has caused increasing of drugs smuggling through Mizoram. Since ethnic clashed erupted in Manipur, the volume of Heroin and other contraband seized in Mizoram is rising compared to the previous period. It appears that drugs smugglers are focussing on smuggling of drugs from Myanmar through Mizoram due to ethnic violence in Manipur, which allegedly retards them from using their smuggling route in Manipur. The recent seizures of smuggled arms and ammunitions and explosives by Assam Rifles inside Mizoram which are reportedly bound for Manipur also indicated Mizoram has been used as a route for smuggling of arms and ammunitions by smugglers. Security has also to be strengthened due to the influx of large numbers of internally displace people from Manipur. Even though, there is no direct threat pose against Meitei living in Mizoram, their safety and security will become a major concern depending upon the situation in Manipur. Therefore, Police forces and other enforcement agencies have to be strengthened during election period in view of prevailing situation led by influx of IDPs from Manipur to Mizoram.

**5. Hmar Peoples Convention (Democratic) and its related issue:**

HPC(D), Hmar Peoples Convention (Democratic) was founded in 1996 with its President as Lalhmingthanga Sanate of Khawlian, Mizoram. However, after 15 years the President himself was impeached on September 2011 by HPC(D) council meeting for reportedly making an agreement with Kuki National Organisation (KNO) Manipur. H. Zosangbera was appointed as the Chairman of HPC(D). As a result of this impeachment, HPC(D) became divided into two factions – H. Zosangbera’s faction and Lalhmingthanga Sanate’s faction.

 After dialogue with Government of Mizoram, H. Zosangbera’s faction come overground at the Arms Carrying Ceremony held at CTI, Sesawng on 13.04.2018. However, Lalhmingthanga Sanate’s faction was dormant for a period of time but became active recently.

**5(a) HPC(D) Recent Activities:**

Lalhmingthanga Sanate of HPC(D) had started serving demand letters to most of the Village Councils located inside HPC(D) demand area (Aizawl, Kolasib and Saitual District) since end of 2022. They had also served another demand letter through Whatsapp during May/June 2023 and intimidating Village Council leaders to fulfill their demand or face consequences.

 Lalhmingthanga Sanate (53) s/o V.L.Ramliana, President, HPC (D) was apprehended by personnel of Assam Rifles and Assam police on 24.12.2022 with a .32 pistol and 48 live ammunitions in his possession in Cachar, Assam and was released on bail from judicial custody on 15.05.2023.

 As long as the armed group of Lalhmingthanga Sanate can move freely between the three sides of Mizoram, Manipur and Assam, they are sure to gain strength by absorbing more volunteers, even the possibilities of joining them by some of the surrendered cadres of H. Zosangbera’s faction cannot be ruled out.

**5(b) Possible repercussion of HPC(D) on MLA Election in Mizoram:**

Criminal cases, mainly in connection with extortion case have been registered against the outfits in recent times. 16 (sixteen) case has been registered in Aizawl District while 5 (five) case has been registered in Saitual District in 2023. This faction of HPC (D) usually seeks shelter along the Barak river of Assam-Manipur-Mizoram border and often operated from there by making intimidating phone calls or sending extortion letters. Due to the current communal tension occurring in Manipur, the outfits has now less interest inside Mizoram and shifted its attention towards the violence hit Manipur. The possibility of making intimidating calls or attempt to coerce voters mainly the Hmar community to cast their votes in favour of a particular political party or candidate in the upcoming MLA General Election 2023 could not be ruled out. However, it is unlikely that the outfit will physically surfaced during the electioneering or disturb the security personnel or election booths during the election since the active cadres are reportedly only as many as 05 (five) members with only one functional automatic weapon.

**6. Drugs Smuggling**

 Mizoram being geographically close to the Golden/Death Triangle and due to the porous unfenced international border with Myanmar became a frequented route for drugs smugglers in recent years. Mizoram which also shares inter-state boundary with three other Indian states is also used as a gateway for trafficking of drugs and other contraband items from Myanmar to Mainland India. Also, the recent unrest in Myanmar causing the decline in the number of military check gates on the Myanmar side and the Myanmar Nationals seeking asylum in India acting as a peddlers/dealers to support themselves financially resulted in the increase of drug trafficking in Indo-Myanmar border. As communal violence occurred in Manipur, which was reportedly one of the major smuggling routes, smugglers could no longer used Manipur as their route; the peaceful state of Mizoram become more vulnerable to such smugglers.

****Comparative drugs seizure by Mizoram Police during 2020 – 2023****

| **Name of Drugs** |  | **Seized Quantity** |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | **2020** | **2021** | **2022**  | **2023** **(Upto July)** |
| Heroin | 8.783 kgs |  | 15.792 Kgs | 49.367 kgs | 42.409 kgs |
| Methamphetamine | 548.718 Kgs |  | 153.778 Kgs | 217.295 kgs | 50.021 kgs |
| Pseudoephedrine | - |  | - | 29.80 kgs | 210.72 kgs |
| Opium | - |  | - | - | 4.918 kgs |


 As clearly seen from the above table, seizures of drugs and other controlled substances are increasing rapidly, which clearly indicated that Mizoram became the major route of drugs smuggling between Myanmar and mainland India. Police Department should conduct more random and check-gate checking during the upcoming GAE 2023.
