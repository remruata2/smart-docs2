**No disbursement of funds for 6 days:**  As a result of the worsening condition of the financial situation of Mizoram, the Treasuries of Mizoram Government have not disburse any funds for six consecutive days, excluding Government holidays.

 The latest released of funds from the treasuries was done by Aizawl South Treasury, which is also the largest treasury in the State on 22nd July 2022. As mentioned earlier, the crisis started when, under instructions from Central government, the State treasuries released all the funds for centrally sponsored scheme (CSS) to their respective nodal agencies. The funds of the State account in RBI were insufficient to meet these CSS funds which resulted in the borrowing of funds from Central government.

 Failure of the State government to repay its debt on or before 4th August 2022 may result in closing of all the treasuries in the state.

****No fixed date for recruitment of police:******Pu Lalchamliana, Home Minister, Mizoram said that because of the worsening financial condition of the state, timeline for recruitment of police in Mizoram cannot be fixed yet.**

 Delivering a speech at 'Mizo Hnam Run' yesterday i.e 1.8.22, the Home Minister expressed that, despite receiving multiple request from various MLAs, NGOs and even party workers to conduct recruitment of police, the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic causes shortage of funds in the State which hinders filling up of more than 2,000 vacancies in police department. He further explained that around 300 posts are vacant each year as a result of promotion, deceased and retirement/resignations of police personnel.
