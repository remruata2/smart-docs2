****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/699

Dated: 17th September, 2019.

 As the final repatriation of Brus residing in 6 (six) Relief Camps of Tripura is scheduled to commence during the first week of October, 2019, the employment of delay tactics or other illegal activities by unwanted elements who are against the repatriation process in order to disrupt the repatriation process cannot be ruled out. It may be recalled that the Bru repatriation process of 2009 was disrupted due to the murder of Zarzokima on 13.11.2009. It is, therefore, advised that patrolling and area domination along the Mizoram – Tripura border and other Bru inhabited areas be intensified so as to prevent any untoward incident that could hamper the repatriation process. Intelligence network may also be heightened and beefed up for advanced collection of intelligence.
