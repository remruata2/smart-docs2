**Mamit District :**

 Bru Repatriation Process - Mizoram and Central Government have repatriated the Bru refugees from Tripura to Mizoram several times without much success. Ministry of Home Affairs has set the deadline for Repatriation of Bru refugees latest by 30th November, 2019.There were 1,681 families (8,869 members) repatriated during 1st to 8th Batch (i.e. 2010 to 2018). And, 280 families (1098 members) were repatriated during 9th Batch and Final of repatriation process (i.e, 3.10.2019 - 30.11.2019).

  The main problems which hampered this repatriation process are the Bru refugees themselves. As they are till longing for their free rations and assistance received from the Central Government because of their status as a refugees, they are reluctant to return to Mizoram with a pretext of raising various unacceptable demands.

There has also been an enormous outcry from Students Organisations and NGOs of Mizoram to the State Government to settle this issue once and for all.

**Champhai District :**

 The 8 Assam Rifles were checking illegal trade activities in Zokhawthar (a town within Champhai District which is located in the border with Myanmar) and have stopped the trade of betel-nut and fertilizer across the Mizoram-Myanmar border since 7.9.2019. This heightened tension in the area and further led to discontentment among the people of Zokhawthar since 80% of the total population are engaged as porters.

  Presently, imports of betel nut and export of fertilizers through Zokhawthar area have been stopped to this day as a result of the restriction imposed by the Assam Rifles. The Law and Order situation of the area has also been contained and additional IR police personnel deployed were also withdrawn from the area.
