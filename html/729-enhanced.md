Subject: Requisition for vehicles.

Sir,

 I am to state that the following vehicles would be required for conveyance of HPC(D) cadres numbering a little over 100 (one hundred) including Council Members and Invitees during the Homecoming and Reception at Zilthawchhuah and Arms Laying Ceremony at CTI, Sesawng which will be organised shortly.

| **Sl No.** | **Types of Vehicles** | **Numbers** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Bus | 4 |
| 2 | Truck | 1 |
| 3 | LMV | 2 |


 Since, the road condition from Vaitin to Zilthawchhuah is not ideal for Buses, the HPC (D) cadres will be picked up in a truck from Zilthawchhuah upto Vaitin. The 2 (two) LMVs preferably Bolero/Sumo are meant for CID (SB) officers who are detailed to perform security duties as well as registration and profiling of the cadres at CTI, Sesawng.

 It is suggested that the above vehicles may either be pulled from Police Headquarters/various other units or on hire system as deemed necessary.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
