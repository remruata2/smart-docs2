It may not be out of place to mention here that Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples Forum (MBDPF) leaders are trying their best to stall any repatriation process citing various flimsy grounds and raising endless demands. In addition, the leaders of MBDPF have pocketed huge sum of money from the cash dole meant for the displaced Bru refugees lodged in different relief camps thereby forming a thriving business for the few. As per the latest intelligence input, some of the leaders of MBDPF have maintained close nexus with Bru militants(i.e United Democratic Liberation Army(UDLA)) led by Shri Doinoram Reang operating from Hailakandi District/Cachar District, Assam with an aim to stall any repatriation process, etc should the need arises and for the reasons best known to them.

It is also a fact that the leaders of MBDPF have taken advantage of various Bru NGOs in the Refugee Camps like Young Bru Association (YBA), Bru Displaced Women Welfare Committee (BDWWC), All Dealers Association(ADA), Bru Displaced Welfare Organisation (BDWO), All Chaudary Committee(ACC), Bru Snungnai Mthoh(BSM),Bru Chaudry Council(BCC), Camp Defence Committee(CDC) for realization of their vested interests and to derail any Repatriation process.
