All the families residing in Tripura at the 7 (seven) Bru relief camps including separated families who doesn’t acquire Relief Ration Card must be consider to get the rehabilitation packages whatsoever if they could obtain the identification slip provided on them at the time the authority had been conducted at the Bru relief camps.
2. As a result, the third incident occurred in the year 2009 following the murder of one Mizo Mr. Zarzokima by unknown miscreants. As a result, again several Bru villages were burnt down and looted by majority Mizo people inside Mizoram. Thousands of Bru have been displaced from Mizoram and now staying at relief camps in North Tripura. And these people and their problems have been brushed aside even though the matter has been placed before the concern authority. The people of this second exodus must be treated with the same to the old migrants.
3. The people of Bru are one of the ethnic community living in Mizoram from the time immemorial and at the same time, the Brus are erroneously recognized as Riang but the nomenclature reveals that the origin we called ourselves is Bru. However, the name Riang has been enlisted in the schedule tribes list of the constitution of India and proclaimed it to be part of the Kuki tribe. This notion of the government agencies had contradicted to the origins of the Bru historical fact. To this regard, it is earnestly demanded the authenticity of the name Bru must not be considered as part of Kuki tribe because the Brus are having a distinct culture, custom, language and identity.
4. Extra expenses amounting to @ Rs.15,000/- should be essentially render it to per family envisaged for the vehicle fares during the course of house construction before the commencement of repatriation process.
