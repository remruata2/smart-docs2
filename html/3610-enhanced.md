**Proposal to include VC and LC under RTI Act:******Officials of Mizoram information Commission (MIC) are presently taking steps for the inclusion of Local Councils and Village Councils under the Right to Information Act as they are the bodies dealing with huge amounts of development funds. Regarding this issue, proposal had been submitted to the government wherein Local Administration Department (LAD) will be issuing a notification in the near future about the Village Councils as they are under their jurisdiction while UD&amp;PA who are looking after the Local Councils wanted to revise the proposal before issuing any notifications. According to the proposal, VC Presidents and LC Chairmen will be departmental appellate authorities if VCs and LCs are appointed as public authorities under the RTI Act while the Secretaries of VCs/LCs will act as SPIOs.
