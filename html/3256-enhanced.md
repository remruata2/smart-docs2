Asteria’s CYGNUS A10 is a mini Unmanned Aerial System designed from the ground up for military and civilian surveillance applications. The system consists of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a MissionControl Station (MCS). The UAV flies autonomously from takeoff to landing and carries a high resolution daylight/infraredcamera for aerial observation. The MCS displays real-time video from the UAV and allows the user to command and control the UAV.

The CYGNUS A10 differentiates itself from its competitors by being the first-in-class UAS to deliver real-time HD resolution aerial video. This is 5x more video resolution than standard definition video streamed by existing UAS. This innovation allows operators to spot much greater detail in their aerial images and videos leading to higher effectiveness of the system. The high definition daylight camera can be swapped with an infrared camera for night time operations.

SALIENT FEATURES

- **Mobile**– Small, lightweight and modular for rapid deployment
- **Autonomous**– Automatic takeoff, navigation and landing
- **Effective**– Delivers real-time HD resolution video from the UAV to the ground station.
- **Terrain Independent**– No runway is required and as such operable in any terrain
- **Reliable**– All composites construction for robust all-weather operation
- **Secure**– Encrypted digital data link for secure transmission of data and video
- **Safe**– Failsafe mechanisms to protect the system
- **Stealthy**– Silent electrical propulsion, inaudible at 150 m

CYGNUS A10 UAV is designed to be modular to allow it to carry other payloads besides video cameras including still cameras, atmospheric monitoring sensors, radiation sensors and acoustic sensors. All the major components of the CYGNUS A10 system including the airframe, the autopilot and the GCS interface are designed and developed by Asteria Aerospace.

APPLICATIONS

The CYGNUS A10 Unmanned Aerial System has several military, paramilitary, commercial and industrial applications. Any application that can benefit from low cost, real-time, localized aerial surveillance is a fit for the CYGNUS A10. The applications highlighted below are indicative and not exhaustive – the potential uses of this technology are limited only by imagination.Contact usto explore how the CYGNUS A10 can meet your needs or for custom solutions for your application.

MILITARY AND PARAMILITARY APPLICATIONS

The CYGNUS A10 can be used as a highly effective tool in military and paramilitary operations. Its capability to deliver real-time high resolution day or night video along with its ruggedness, portability and ease of use make it an indispensable platform for such applications. The CYGNUS A10 is ideally suited as an ISR platform to support offensive operations over-the-hill recce missions, low intensity conflicts, battlefield damage assessment, deception operations as well as defensive/peacetime operations such as border security, convoy protection, and planning and monitoring battle positions.

POWERLINE AND PIPELINE MONITORING

An emerging industrial application for the CYGNUS A10 aerial surveillance system is the monitoring of long stretches of electrical powerlines and oil/gas pipelines for damage, leaks, and security, especially over terrain which is hard to reach over ground. The ease of use and low acquisition and operating cost of the CYGNUS A10 system make it an ideal candidate to automate such tasks for the energy industry.

NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

The CYGNUS A10 also finds applications in managing natural resources such as mineral ores, forests, water bodies, wildlife and marine life. It can assist authorities in mapping and enforcing boundaries of coal and ore mining.It can support wildlife preservation efforts as a surveillance tool against poaching and smuggling activities. It can be used to map and monitor boundaries of forests and water bodies, locate areas of fish population and many such applications which can greatly benefit from low cost aerial surveillance.
