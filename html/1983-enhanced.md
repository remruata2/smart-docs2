**BRIEF HISTORY:**

******The above are my particulars. I was born in the year 1993 at Dinthar Bethel, Mamit District. I have 1 (one) brother and 5 (five) sisters. From Dinthar Bethel my whole family moved to Naisingpara Refugee Camp, Tripura but I could not remember the exact year. After we reached Naisingpara, I did whatever work is available. Then in July 2013 BDFM S/S Army chief Lalduhawma and his friend Jasminpa came to Naisingpara refugee camp. During that time I was looking for job, and they promise me a better job and salary and followed them as they have invited me and went to Bangladesh. After we reached Bangladesh, they asked me to call and inform my parents and told them that I have joined Bru gang/underground through mobile phone.**

After we reached Bangladesh, we were stationed at a camp near Thangnang village as we have a farm and all the new recruits are made to work in the farm as we have no training and we did not even carry any arms. We were made to work in a farm between Trungpara and Thangnang village, sometimes we were asked to get ration at Balsuri bazaar, Bangladesh, but most of the time we worked in the farm.

Since we were asked to work very hard all the time, it was not upto my expectation. So, I was looking for a chance to escape from camp and on the last week of june while we were near Thangnang village farm, Endro Msha, Chhandama and myself escape.

After we escape from the camp, me and my friends went back to Naisingpara and stayed with our families. While we were there, Thlamuana came and told us that he will help us clean our cases. We followed Thlamuana to Silchar and unfortunately at Silchar Mizoram Police CID (SB) arrested us.
