****Write up on Border Management Issues-****

****Bangladesh-India & India-Myanmar****

Proper management of borders, which is vital to the national security, presents many challenges and includes coordination and concerted action by the administrative, diplomatic, security, intelligence, legal, regulatory and economic agencies of the country to secure the frontiers and serve its best interests.

 Approach and practices of border management vary from one border to another, based on the security perceptions and relationship with the neighbouring country.

Mizoram has a long international boundary with two countries (512 kms with Myanmar and 318 kms with Bangladesh). There are 3 (three) Battalions of Assam Rifles deployed at the Indo-Myanmar border and 3 (three) Battalions of BSF deployed along Indo-Bangladesh border. In addition, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) along the border supplementing the central armed forces.

_Factors affecting Indo (Mizoram)-Bangladesh and Indo(Mizoram)- Myanmar Border Management_

(i) The porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh served as an important routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs.

(ii) The porous border areas have widely encouraged other criminal activities like abduction/kidnapping of Indian citizens by Bangladesh based insurgent groups.

(iii) The porous border area also open for influx of foreign nationals from Bangladesh i.e Chakmas/Bengali Muslim and Myanmarese from Myanmar into the state of Mizoram. The junction of Mizoram, Bangladesh and Myanmar is also vulnerable for infiltration point of Muslim Rohingyas from Myanmar.

(iv) The recent increase in the smuggling of Gold and contraband drugs like Pseudoephedrine, Methamphetamine across the border has called for immediate and proper attention. In this regard, Mizoram Police has made several recoveries.

(v) Identical tribes live on both sides of the boundary pose difficulty in restricting the movement of the people.

_Major Initiatives for effective Border Management_

_(i) Fencing of Indo-Bangladesh border:_

  The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was 344.41 Km out of which about 70% work have been completed.

 According to Mizoram State Boundary Committee, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram are now within Bangladesh side of the border due to irresponsibility of the construction companies who are fencing the Mizoram- Bangladesh border. The Boundary Committee also found that the fences pass through the middle of 20 other villages.

 Border fencing work could not be undertaken along a 60-km stretch in the Dampa Tiger Reserve owing to pending clearances from the National Board of Wildlife, which has demanded that the State transfer of around 1,520 hectares of non-forestland in compensation.

_(ii) Border Flood Lights:_

 The progress of floodlighting work as on 31.12.2015 along Mizoram-Bangladesh border is as follows:

 Completed : 335.66 kms.

****Out of the total of 91 Border Out-Posts (BOPs) approved , the construction in respect of 18 BOPs has been completed and the work in other 73 BOPs are yet to be established along Mizoram-Bangladesh Borders.
