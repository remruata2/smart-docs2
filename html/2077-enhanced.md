****The recent Al Qaeda video directly threatening India that Al Qaeda is opening a south Asia branch and that Kashmir, Assam and Gujarat will be its target areas within India as also that Bangladesh, Myanmar will be within its range of operations, just cannot be taken lightly. We must improve centre-state coordination on all matters concerning terror as Mizoram shares a long porous border with neighboring countries of****Bangladesh and Myanmar. The state also shares border with Assam, Tripura and Manipur. This makes the state particularly vulnerable as the region could be used by Al Qaeda for expanding its reach with other terrorist groups/non terrorist organizations of Myanmar, Bangladesh and other states of the North East India.****

****We have taken all possible precautionary steps at our end. However, we need to work very closely with the Central Government and its agencies on this, given the nature of challenge and sensitivity involved. It is therefore, suggested that an institutional arrangement may be put in place with representatives from the State of North East India and measure may be worked out to strengthen the internal security apparatus at the State Level. You may accordingly consider constituting a Committee, with representatives from the State Governments of the North Eastern region, which can monitor the developments, recommend appropriate course of action to deal with evolving situations, and supervise the follow up action at various levels.****

**I should be grateful for an early action in the matter.**
