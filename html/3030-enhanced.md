No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/705

Dated: 18th September, 2019.

 In continuation of our Special Report No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/675, Dt. 13.9.2019. Mizoram Police deployed 2 (two) Platoons of Force from 1st IR Bn., Khawzawl today, i.e. 18.9.2019 for Law &amp; Order duty at Zokhawthar, Champhai District. SP, Champhai convened a meeting with Village Council &amp; leaders of NGOs today @ 11:00 a.m at Zokhawthar Police Outpost. Leaders of Zokhawthar NGOs apprised the meeting about their grievances and stated that they have no intention to create Law &amp; Order problems. They further mentioned about their utter amazement and disappointment over the deployment of Police forces.

 Consequently, Zokhawthar VC &amp; All NGOs issued a Press Release today, i.e. 18.9.2019 wherein they highlighted about their surprise over the unexpected deployment of Mizoram Police at Zokhawthar on 18.9.2019 @ 12:00 noon for Law &amp; Order duty and expressed this action as uncalled for. Highlighting about their full obedience of any instruction of the Assam Rifles and stating their non-intention to create Law &amp; Order problems, the PR demanded authority to find out and punish any person who gave wrong information to the authority which resulted in wastage of Government’s money in deployment of Police forces. The PR highlighted about difficulties faced by their village due to the stoppage of trade of some items across Mizoram-Myanmar border since 7.9.2019 by 8th Bn. Assam Rifles and a meeting called by DC, Champhai in this regard inviting all stakeholders which is scheduled to be held on 19.9.2019. They also expressed their optimism of solving the problems. They further demanded the Government to withdraw the Police forces deployed at the earliest.

 It is, therefore, advisable to send reliable officer from concerned Departments, including Central Customs to Zokhawthar and apprise the inhabitants of Zokhawthar about the illegality of trading of the banned items, i.e. betel nut and fertilizers, across Mizoram-Myanmar.
