**Subject: **Action Taken and Suggestions Regarding Illegal Transportation of Arecanuts****

Sir,

 With reference to your letter No.R.CR-55A/2024/1282 dated 11.12.2024 regarding the illegal transportation of Arecanuts from Myanmar vîa Champhai-Zotlang and further movement through various checkpoints, necessary enquiry has been conducted and findings is submitted as follows:-

**1. Confirmation of Information**

 Our preliminary enquiry confirms that Arecanuts are being stealthily transported via secret routes from Champhai-Zotlang up to Tuipui and onward to Aizawl using certain vehicles with a proper escort vehicle by the smugglers.

 However, regarding the alleged bribery at Khawzawl Police Checkgate (Rs. 40,000/-) and Customs Checkgate at Seling (Rs. 130,000/-), we could not establish conclusive evidence due to the lack of clear CCTV footage and specific details such as date and time of movement and vehicle registration number of the vehicle utilised for the transportation.

**2. Current Measures Taken**

 A directive has been issued to all Sectoral Office of CID(SB) personnel in the affected areas, particularly along suspected secret routes. Efforts are underway to trace the registration numbers of vehicles suspected to be involved. Any identified vehicle will be subjected to thorough investigation. Liaison with Customs officials has been initiated to share intelligence and strengthen cooperation in monitoring illegal activities at the check gates.

**3. Suggestions for Enhanced Action**

 Installation of Surveillance Systems: It is strongly recommended that high resolution CCTV cameras with night vision be installed at critical checkpoints, particularly Champhai and Khawzawl, to monitor activities and gather reliable evidence as the present CCTV cameras are not functioning effectively.

1. **Formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT):**Establishing an SIT comprising members from the Police, Customs, and other relevant agencies would facilitate a coordinated approach in investigating and curbing this illegal trade.

1. **Deployment of Undercover Personnel:**Placing undercover officers at checkpoints and along suspected routes could help gather actionable intelligence on smuggling activities and involved personnel.

 Efforts will continue to intercept and disrupt illegal transportation activities, and any developments will be reported promptly.

Yours faithfully
