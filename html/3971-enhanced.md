****NOTES ON AGENDA POINTS FOR LIA MEETING 28.04.2025****

I. **Turmoil in Bangladesh, causes, present situation and way forward**:

Bangladesh is currently experiencing significant political turmoil. The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has banned the Awami League, the party of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, under an anti-terrorism law. This move has been denounced by the Awami League as "fascist" and illegal.

Yunus, who has been facing pressure from various political parties, has threatened to resign if parties don't support him. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has asked Yunus to hold elections by December 2025, while Jamaat-e-Islami has suggested possible poll timeframes.

The country's Election Commission is awaiting a formal notification from the government to decide on scrapping the Awami League's registration. This ban could disqualify the party from contesting the upcoming general election, scheduled to take place between December 2025 and June 2026.

Meanwhile, the Bangladesh army has been involved in talks with President Md Shahabuddin, fueling rumors of a potential constitutional overhaul. The situation remains volatile, with various political parties and student groups demanding elections and protesting against the interim government.

  The Indo-Bangladesh border in Mizoram Lawngtlai and Lunglei District are actively patrolled by the BSF and the activities along the border is closely monitored by the District Police.

**II. **Security scenario in Mizoram with special reference to insurgency and smuggling**:**

**Insurgency :**

  Security scenario in Mizoram is mostly peaceful. However, with the influx of refugees into Mizoram due to the political condition in the neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh, some commercial activities are being exploited/used by these refugees to earn their living which is not welcomed by the local residents of Mizoram. Moreover, the refugees have started involving in criminal cases within Mizoram.

  Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and reorganized themselves during the year 2022. They have been indulging in collection of donation and extortion from the closing months of 2022. In this regard, 27 criminal cases have been registered in Mizoram against the cadres of Lalhmingthanga Sanate (HPCD) faction till date out of which 8 cases have been Charge-sheeted and 7 HPC(D) cadres arrested. However, no new activities of the HPC(D) is reported.

**Smuggling:**

Due to the peaceful nature and the geographical proximity of the state to the Death Triangle, Mizoram has been exploited as a safe route for smuggling of narcotics drugs. After the military coup in Myanmar on February, 2021, there has been an increase in the number of seizures of narcotics drugs in Mizoram possible either due to the funding of some ethnic armed groups by narcotic smugglers or the direct involvement of these armed groups in the smuggling activities to fund their operations. The ethnic conflict in the state of Manipur which started in the month of May, 2023 disallowed movement of goods including smuggled narcotics drugs across the state which further increases smuggling of narcotics through the state of Mizoram.

The modus operandi and ways of concealment of smuggled narcotics used by smugglers is constantly evolving. The past seizures of narcotics in the state revealed that these drugs are often concealed in sealed food packages, vegetables, electrical goods and more commonly inside a car door panel or costumed concealed compartment inside a vehicle.

Smuggling of explosives in the state is witnessed mainly after the military coup in Myanmar which could be attributed to the reported use of such explosives by ethnic armed groups to fight against the military junta. These smuggled explosives mainly consist of gelatin sticks and its detonators are illegally procured locally from some explosive licence holders who often gave out the explosives for mining purposes. The number of arms and ammunition seized in the state even though decreases in the last few months, the possibility of arms and ammunition smuggled across the state by some ethnic armed groups of Myanmar could not be ruled out due to the recent capturing of most of Myanmar Army camps in Chin and Rakhine state.

Further, the emerging trend of using end to end encrypted messaging applications and compartmentalizing activities like logistics, finances or intelligence gathering by different groups or units complicated the interception of modern narcotics syndicates.

  On **18.05.2025**CID (SB) operation party, acting on intelligence collected, conducted operation on the night of 17.05.2025 along the stretch between Serchhip, Tlungvel, Seling and Sesawng and at around 02:00 am of 18.05.2025, successfully intercepted one TATA SK 407 BR/No. MZ-01/M-1935 fully loaded with ginger at the outskirt of Seling, along the Sesawng road.
