**SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF MIZORAM POLICE:**

1. **Independent and External Board/Authority to conduct Recruitment of Constables:**

The efficiency of police force largely depends on conduct of fair and impartial recruitment wherein only the best and qualified candidates gets recruited into police department. This is particularly crucial at the constabulary level as they are the most visible rank of police force. In this regard, it is desirable to have an independent, external and fully autonomous board for conduct of the whole process of recruitment. For instance, if Delhi Police are somehow entrusted to conduct recruitment of Mizoram Police Constables, it would eliminate possible undue outside influence, interference or favouritism and would result in selection of the best and qualified persons.

1. **District-Wise Recruitment of Constables:**

One of the problems affecting efficiency of Mizoram Police is uneven representation of various districts in the Force. Recruitment is by and large Aizawl-centric, in the sense that, wholesome majority of candidates qualified in the examinations are of Aizawl district. This has, more often than not, resulted in problems in transfer and posting as most of them longed to be posted in Aizawl and often seek their own means to get the desired posting. Some districts are comparatively under-staffed as compared to other districts, thereby effecting efficient functioning of the district police.

In view of the above, it is suggested that recruitment of police constables be conducted district-wise in which the requirement of police personnel of a particular district will be met by qualified candidates of the district. Only in case of shortfall of qualified candidates, persons residing in other districts may be recruited. At the same time, due attention should be given to ensure that candidates residing in various parts of the district are selected.

1. **Registration of CID (SB) Vehicles:**

As the very nature of works and method of functioning of CID (SB) is different and unique from other Units of Mizoram Police, it is found desirable that vehicles allotted to SB are registered in such a manner that it cannot be traced to have connection with ‘Police’. During conduct of operations or laying of traps, such as, a drugs, arms, etc, maintenance of full secrecy is of utmost importance and the very fact that the owner or authority on whose name a particular vehicle is registered can easily be known in an instance by ‘VAHAN’ or other means, put at risk the very success of the operation as it could blow the cover of incognito.

1. **Dedicated Staff for SB:**

Experience has time and again shown that efficient SB operatives are the ones who have a correct aptitude and mindset and one who have been posted in the Unit for a fairly long period of time. It is one Unit where even a Constable can prove his mettle and worth and even becomes more valuable for the Unit than a person who is of higher rank. This is more so the case at Subordinate and Constabulary levels where a right person can be a huge asset for the Unit.

In this regard, selection of right person becomes highly important and permanent or semi-permanent tenure in the Unit, particularly of the lower ranks, can prove to be a useful instrument in shaping a right and efficient SB operatives.
