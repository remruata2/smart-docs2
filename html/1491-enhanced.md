Action Taken Report :

Point No. VIII: Peace process for insurgency free North East

 After a Memorandum of Settlement was signed between Government of Mizoram and HPC (D) H.Zosangbera faction on 2nd April 2018 followed by the Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC (D) at CTI, Sesawng on 13th April 2018, there has been no active insurgent groups in the state. At the same time, activities of these former underground members and suspected persons are being constantly monitored. As such, the state of Mizoram, at the moment, may be considered as Insurgent free state of the North East.
