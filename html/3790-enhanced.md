The Indo-Myanmar border posts are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

 Military takeover took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 whendemocratically electedmembers ofMyanmar'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy, were deposed by Myanmar's Military. The Myanmar Military proclaimed a year-longstate of emergencyand declared that power had been vested inCommander-in-Chief of Defence ServicesGeneral Min Aung Hlaing. It declared the results of theNovember 2020 general electionas invalid and stated its intent to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency. In opposition of Military takeover that ousted the country’s democratically elected leaders, thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Myanmar.

 The escalating resistance put up against the military regime by Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) definitely had an impact and permeate the Indo Myanmar boundary, which resulted in influx of a considerable number of refugees arriving and taking shelter in Mizoram and Manipur. Input received stated that CRPH and CDM supporters are adamant and determined to continue their resistance which had shown a new level including armed resistance for their personnel defence. CRPH and CDM had been steadfast in collecting arms and ammunitions as much as possible from the neighboring countries particularly from the state of Mizoram and Manipur. Besides, they are intending to impart wide scale training on handling of arms and weaponry to its youth supporters. However, the training is yet to commenced due to non availability of suitable training ground.
