****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/149

Dated: 4th March, 2019.

Information has been received that 9 (nine) members from Chawngte Group YMA and Mualbu visited Chengkawllui (an alleged illegal Chakma settlement), Lunglei District today, i.e. 4.3.2019 @ 10:00 a.m, to check on the inhabitants of the illegal settlement. However, all the Chakma settlers, comprising of 16 (sixteen) households, had already evacuated the settlement with most of their belongings by the time the YMA members reached Chengkawllui. The YMA members burnt down 15 of the 16 huts, which were found empty, so that there will be no more homestead to return to while 1 (one) hut was left un-burnt as there were household items like clothing, utensils, beddings, etc. inside the hut.

These illegal settlers were earlier notified by Tawipui Group YMA on 26.1.2019 to leave their settlement before the end of February, 2019. Even though the area falls under Lunglei District it was easier to approach from Chawngte (Lawngtlai District) side. Therefore, YMAs of Chawngte-P and Mualbu-L under Chawngte Group YMA had performed the checking even though the area falls under Tawipui Group YMA area.
