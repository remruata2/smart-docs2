****ROADMAP ON SEPARATION OF INVESTIGATION FROM LAW AND ORDER IN MIZORAM****

1. **Introduction:**

 Separation of Investigation from Law and Order is one of the most important subjects in the field of policing in India which has been deliberated upon by the police functionaries, various Police Reform Committees, the Law Commission and even by the Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court of India vide its order dated 22.1.2006 in Writ petition (civil) 310 of 1996 in the matter of Parkas Singh Vs Union of India had issued directives which reads “The investigating police shall be separated from the law and order police to ensure speedier investigation, better expertise and improved rapport with the people. It must, however, be ensured that there is full coordination between the two wings. The separation, to start with, may be effected in towns/ urban areas which have a population of ten lakhs or more, and gradually extended to smaller towns/ urban areas also”. The apex Court on April 11, 2013 had even issued notice to all states and UTs to appraise it of implementation of its 2006 order on police reforms.

 The Rebeiro Committee (1998), the Padmanabhaiah Committee on Police Reforms, the Malimanth Committe on Reforms of Criminal Justice System (2004) the Police Act Drafting Committee (2006), the National Police Commission and the Law Commission had dealt the subject at great length and expressed views and recommendations in favour of separation of investigation from Law and Order.

 There have been discussions even among higher authorities of Mizoram Police to set up a separate investigation and law and order wing but the scheme is yet to be implemented till today. The delay in the implementation of the Apex Court directives in the State could be attributed to few incidents of Law and Order problems and low crime rate in the state. However, with the increase in the number of population especially at the state capital, Aizawl coupled with advancement in science and technology, Mizoram has undergone massive changes in all aspects of life. And today, the State Capital Aizawl is witnessing various forms of agitations; strike etc. from various quarters on a regular basis. Besides, a number of cases registered at various Police Stations of the State are on the rise which demands better policing. Therefore, it is a high time that the state seriously considers creating a separate investigation and law and order wing.

1. **Reasons for separation of Investigation from Law and Order:**

 Separation of Investigation from Law and Order is desirable in Aizawl City due to the following reasons:

1. _To expedite Investigation of Cases_: There is so much delay in investigation of cases and sometimes Charge sheet is not submitted to Court within a mandatory period which results in an accused being untimely enlarged on Bail by the Court. One of the main reasons for a delay is that the Investigating Officers are over burdened with Law and Order duties, VIP duties and various other miscellaneous duties that they cannot concentrate on their cases. If they are relieved from such duties they would be able to devote more time on their cases which will result in speedier investigation.
2. _To conduct flawless investigation of cases_: The Investigating Officers are distracted by Law and Order and other miscellaneous duties which also detract from their efficiency. Investigation of cases especially of heinous crimes requires a high level of concentration on the part of investigating officer to avoid loopholes. Therefore, Investigating Officers should be free from such distractions in order to conduct flawless investigation.
3. _To earn convictions in the Court:_ Due to their engagement in many other law and order and miscellaneous duties, Investigating Officers could not concentrate on their case which leads to haphazard disposal of cases. Such careless investigation does not stand scrutiny of the court and usually result in acquittal. In order to earn more convictions, Investigating Officers should be relieved from law and order duties.
4. _To relieve the burden of Investigating Officer_: The 4 (four) Police Stations in Aizawl City namely Aizawl, Bawngkawn, Kulikawn and Vaivakawn PS investigated approximately 1300 to 1500 cases in a year. The total number of Investigating Officers in the four Police Stations is just 50 (Fifty) approximately. So, in an average, each Investigating Officer of the four Police Stations investigates 30 to 35 numbers of cases in a year with an average of 10 number of under investigation cases at a time. Assigning of law and order duties and other miscellaneous duties overburden the Investigating Officer to such an extent that Investigation suffers a major setback.
5. _To have a strong team of Investigating Officer:_ Investigation is a difficult task which should be handled by a competent officer. As per the current practice, usually the ability, aptitude and conduct of an officer is not considered before he or she is posted in the Police Station which deals with both Investigation and Law and Order duties. As a result, some investigating officer at the Police Stations does not know the head and tail of investigation while some of them even indulge in indiscipline conducts. Separation of Investigation from law and order will help in bringing efficient officer to the Investigtion Wing to handle cases.

1. _Areas where separation of Investigation from Law and Order should be effected:_

In line with the directives of the Supreme Court, separation of Investigaton from Law and Order may be effected in the four police Stations within Aizawl City namely Aizawl, Bawngkawn, Kulikawn and Vaivakawn PS which comes under Aizawl District Executive Force (Aizawl DEF). These four Police Stations handle the highest number of criminal cases as well as Law and Order problems in the state. Due to few incidents of Law and Order problems and other crimes, the scheme may not be feasible in other Police Stations of the State as of now.

It may be pertinent to mention here that Aizawl DEF already has a separate Law and Order and Crime Cell at the office of Superintendent of Police, Aizawl and both the branches are being looked after by Additional Superintendents of Police under the overall control of Superintendent of Police. However, the two branches play only a supervisory role for the whole District Police in the field of Investigation and Law and Order. The Crime Branch manned by a handful of staff, keep a record of all the cases registered within Aizawl District, issue necessary instructions and guidance to Investigating Officers etc. Likewise, the Law and Order Cell has a handful of staffs who plays a coordinators role in the event of Law and Order problems. So, there has been a clearcut lines of demarcation between investigation and Law and Order at the highest office of Aizawl DEF.

1. _Separation of Investigation from Law and Order at Police Station level:_

The four Police Stations within Aizawl City such as Aizawl, Bawngkawn, Kulikawn and Vaivakawn PS will have a separate wings of Investigation and Law and Order with both the wings headed by an officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police. Officer in Charge of the respective Police Station will be the overall in charge of both the wings in his Police Station. Where the SHO or OC of a Police Station is of the rank of Inspector, the I/C Investigation Wing and the Law and Order Wing will either be an Inspector junior to the SHO or a Sub-Inspector. Where the SHO is of the rank of Sub-Inspector, the I/C Investigation Wing and the Law and Order Wing will be a Sub- Inspector junior to the SHO.

1. _Strength and Selection of Staffs for Investigation wing and Law and Order Wing:_

 Initially, manpower for Investigation Wing of a Police Station will be selected by Superintendent of Police of the District from the District Police based on following criteria and general guidance which will be issued by the Director General of Police:

1. Good general reputation
2. General suitability for investigation work based on previous experience
3. Knowledge of Law and Investigation
4. Educational Qualification and additional skills
5. Performance in professional investigation courses.

 The initial selection should be purely temporary and should be subject to a screening process after three months. All future inductions in investigation wing will be made through a screening process to be decided by the Director General of Police. The Screening process would only determine eligibility for induction into investigation wing and not confer any right of induction in investigation wing.

 Selection of staff for Law and Order Wing should also be made by the same authorities as in the case of Investigation wing keeping in view the General suitability for Law and Order duties based on previous experience.

 As far as possible, adequate number of staffs should be posted in both the wings of the four Police Stations. Preferably, the number of staffs of both Investigation and Law and Order Wing of a police station should not be less than 30 (thirty) in Aizawl and Bawngkawn PS and not less than 20 (twenty) in Kulikawn and Vaivakawn PS. The proportion of staffs in the two wings may be changed as per demands of the situation.

1. _Duties of Investigation Wing and Law and Order Wing_:

The staff of Investigation wing of a Police Station shall investigate or enquire all cognizable and non cognizable offences which occur within their respective area of jurisdictions.

Law and Order Wing of a Police Station will perform all duties other than Investigation of cases such as Law and order duty, VIP/VVIP Duty and all other miscellaneous duties within their respective jurisdiction.

However, as per the directives of the Supreme Court it must be ensured that there is full coordination between the two wings.

1. _Tenure and Posting:_

Once selected for staff of investigation wing, a police officer will have tenure of 2 years, renewable by 2 years (multiple times) subject to the condition of satisfactory performance in the last two years to be judged by a committee formed by the Police Headquarters to this effect. As far as possible, an enrolled Police officer of any rank in investigation wing of a police station will not be posted in home police stations.

1. _Training of officers of Investigation and law and order wing:_

 Special training and refresher courses including latest amendments in law, updated scientific aids to investigation, new technology that may help investigation, Court / Legal procedures etc. will be organized by the Training Branch, Mizoram Police for the entire staff selected/ posted in the investigation wing of the Police Stations. It should be made mandaory for each and every officers in the investigation wing to attend one such refresher course every year. Similarly, special training and refresher cources on Confrontation Management, Crowd Control, VIP/VVIP Security etc. including latest technigues in the field of Law and Order duties should be organised for Law and Order staffs on a regular basis.

1. I/C Investigation Wing will closely monitor the performance of all Investigating Officers besides himself being involved in investigation of cases.
2. Officer in Charge of a Police Station should hold weekly meeting with investigating officers of his Police Station. He should even lead or accompany Investigating Officer while visiting a scene of crime in order to instil confidence in the minds of Investigating Officer.

**Conclusion:**

Separation of Investigation from Law and Order will entail efficiency in discharge of assigned duties resulting in police professionalism and complainant satisfaction. Scrutiny and Supervision could be more scientific and more technical in their own aspects. However, there can also be some disadvantages in placing the investigation and law and order in watertight compartments. The National Police Commission in its Seventh Report (1981) had rightly expressed its views that if the lines of command and control for law and order and crime investigation wings are totally separate, the contact between these two wings will tend to be practically eliminated resulting in their isolation from each other. Therefore, the two wings at the Police Station level should work in close coordination under Officer-in-Charge of a Police Station. Nevertheless, separation of Investigation from law and order will results in better investigation of criminal cases as an Investigating Officer would be able to give adequate time and attention to their cases which is often neglected at present.
