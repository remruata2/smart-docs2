Dated: 5th October, 2019.

 Information has been received that HPC party made an appeal to other political parties not to field their party candidates in the upcoming Sinlung Hills Council (SHC) Election scheduled to be held on 5.11.2019 and to reserve for HPC party since it is going to be the first election in the Council. They have already sent an appeal letter to other political parties in this regard.

 Input received indicated that Nomination Committee of HPC party held a meeting yesterday, i.e. 4.10.2019 @ 11:00 a.m. at Sakawrdai under the chairmanship of Pu Thanglianchhunga, President and was attended by other 6 (six) members, viz. Pu Rohringa, Vice President; Pu K. Hrangkunga, Treasurer; Pu Khawlremthanga, CEC Member; Evan Bijoy, Executive Member; Pu Lalthangliana, Executive Member; Pu Lalthlamuana, CEM, SHC and reviewed about the appeal made to other political parties. The meeting once again resolved to continue their appeal to other parties not to contest the upcoming election as the HPC party is the sole party striving for the establishment of SHC. Input received indicated that the meeting could not finalise their candidates since the response of other political parties to their appeal could not be confirmed at this stage. They further resolved to send their party leaders to Aizawl to meet other political party leaders to follow up their appeal.
 PRISM party already accepted and decided not to field candidates and a Press Release to this effect was issued by PRISM as reflected in our DSI dated 3.10.2019.

 Further information received indicated that MNF party is intending to field candidates in the election despite the appeal made by HPC party.

 Information received indicated that the Committee highlighted about their opposition of any interference from any unwanted elements in the upcoming election. They expressed their desire of conducting the election in free and fair manner and will strongly object any kind of unfair practise by any organisation.
