****BRIEF NOTE ON HPCD/MBDA****

** Hmar People Convention (HPC) was formed on Dt.3.7.1986 at Sakawrdai, Aizawl District with the aim of creating Autonomous District Council in Hmar tribes inhabited areas of north eastern and western part of Mizoram, bordering Assam and Manipur which comprise 26 (twenty six) villages within Mizoram state. After struggling to achieve their objective by resorting to arms/ violence for 5 (five) consecutive years w.e.f. 1989 with 13 (thirteen) rounds of peace talks between the HPC and the Government of Mizoram, Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed between the two parties on 27.7.1994 which resulted into the setting up of Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) in 1997. However, certain members of HPC, led by Pu Lalhmingthanga Sanate of Khawlian village, who were disgruntled with the MoS, signed in 1994, had formed **HPC (Democratic) in 1996**.**

 The HPC (D) had split into two factions on 29.9.2011 following the impeachment of its president, Lalhmingthanga Sanate for signing a Deed of Agreement to join the Kuki National Organization (KNO). One faction is led by H.Zosangbera, Gen. Secretary and the other by the deposed President, Lalhmingthanga Sanate.

 Memorandum of Settlement between the Government of Mizoram and Hmar People's Convention (D), H .Zosangbera's group was signed on 2.04.2018.

 When a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) way back in 2018, Lalhmingthanga Sanate designated his HPC(D) splinter faction as 'HPC(D) (President's Group)' and did not participated in the said MoS. During that time, his group consisted of around 13 cadres with an estimated 4/5 weapons holding. However, by February 2020, 11(eleven) of his cadres deserted him and joined HPC(D)- General Headquarters Sinlung Group, who are under the leadership of Lalkhama @ LK Hmar.

Lalhmingthanga Sanate, Founder President of Hmar People Convention (Democratic), presently residing with his family members at Hmarkhawlian, Cachar District, Assam (who refused to over ground during the Peace Accord signed by HPC(D) and government of Mizoram in the year 2018) held a meeting with RC Singson @ Ramchanlova (former Army Chief of HPC(D)) of Thenzawl, Mizoram on 15.12.2021 at Hmarkhawlian, Assam in connection with the tense Mizoram-Assam inter-state border situation. After discussing the matter at length, the duo decided to raise new outfit in the name of “Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA)” with the following plan of actions:

1. To launch attack against Assam Police deployed along Assam-Mizoram border with Arms.
2. To threaten/intimidate Non-mizos residing along the Assam-Mizoram border.
3. To procure arms and ammunitions from National Socialist Council of Nagaland –NSCN (IM).
4. To collect donation from residents of Saiphai, Mizoram and its surrounding areas for procurement of arms and ammunitions.
