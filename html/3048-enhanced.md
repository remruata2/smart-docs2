No.MSB/CB/SR/2020/031

Dated: 13th January, 2020.

 Information has been received that the NGOs of Bungtlang South and Nghalimlui are intending to organize procession on 14.1.2020 @ 9:00 a.m at Vaseikai, Lawngtlai District in protest of the alleged murder of Lalrawnliana (32) S/o A. Lalhmuaka of Bungtlang South, whose dead body was found on 11.1.2020 (Saturday) near Nghalimlui village.

 Information received indicated that the deceased, Lalrawnliana arrived Nghalimlui on 3.1.2020 on family programme. He went missing from the village since 4.1.2020 and search was conducted by the villagers of Bungtlang South, Nghalimlui and Vaseikai. His dead body was found on 11.1.2020 near Nghalimlui and necessary investigation is being taken up by Vasei PS. He was buried on 12.1.2019 at Bungtlang South after PME was conducted.

 In this connection, one Bru, i.e, Chondro Bahadur (34) s/o Joino Ham of Tuisentlang, Lawngtlai District was apprehended and he subsequently made confession before Police and admitted his guilt. The other 2 (two) alleged accused persons from Tuichawngtlang absconded to avoid police arrest.

 Consequently in protest of the incident, NGOs of Bungtlang South and Nghalimlui villages intended to organize procession on 14.1.2020 @ 9:00 a.m at Vaseikai. It is learnt that the villagers of Bungtlang South intended to go to Vaseikai tonight itself.

 Necessary security arrangement is done by concern District police and reinforcement is also made by deploying personnel from 2nd Battalion MAP, Lunglei.

 It may be mentioned that the probability of the communal tension arising between Lai and Chakma/Bru cannot be ruled out as the murder of a Mizo by a non-Mizo (Bru) can easily assume communal colour. Bungtlang South is dominated by Lai people whereas Brus and Chakmas are majority in Nghalimlui and Vaseikai.

Situation is under close watch.
