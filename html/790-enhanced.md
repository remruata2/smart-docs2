****WRITE UP ON CITIZENSHIP (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2016****

**CITIZENSHIP (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2016**

 The main points of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 may be highlighted as follows:

The Bill is intended to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, eligible for citizenship.

Under the Act, one of the requirements for citizenship by naturalisation is that the applicant must have resided in India during the last 12 months, and for 11 of the previous 14 years. The Bill aims to relax this 11 year requirement to six years for persons belonging to the above mentioned six religions and three countries.

The Bill provides that the registration of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders may be cancelled if they violate any law.

**ARTICLE 371G IN THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, 1949:**

371G. Special provision with respect to the State of Mizoram Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution,

(a) no Act of President in respect of

(i) religious or social practices of the Mizos,

(ii) Mizo customary law and procedure,

(iii) administration of civil and criminal justice involving decisions according to Mizo customary law,

(iv) ownership and transfer of land, shall apply to the State of Mizoram unless the Legislative Assembly of the State of Mizoram by a resolution so decides: Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply to any Central Act in force in the union territory of Mizoram immediately before the commencement of the Constitution (Fifty third Amendment) Act, 1986 ;

(b) the Legislative Assembly of the State of Mizoram shall consist of not less than forty members.

 Referring to the above Article 371G of the Indian Constitution, it most likely appears that the article still prevents any individual from enjoying the above provisions under the Article though it may not prevent them from acquiring citizenship under the provisions of the Bill if it becomes an Act.

 The programme was over @ 2:50 p.m and the participants dispersed peacefully without any untoward incident.

**All Political parties have expressed their opposition to the Bill;**

Pu Zoramthanga, Hon’ble Chief Minister met Pu Narendra Modi, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India yesterday, i.e. 14.01.2019 @5:00 p.m. at Delhi in which he conveyed opposition of the Bill. He is expected to meet the Hon’ble Union Home Minister today, i.e. 15.01.2018 in which he is expected to deliver the same opinion. Party leaders also confirmed MNF opposition to the Bill. The accusation made by Pu Lalduhoma, leader of ZPM, that MNF had made a statement in social media that there is nothing to fear from the Bill may have stemmed from the fact that one Lallenmawia Jongte, Joint Secretary, Media Department, MNF, made a post on Facebook claiming that there is nothing to fear from the Bill as the state is protected by the Peace Accord, 1986 signed between the Govt. of India and MNF (whichcan be related to provisions under Article 371G of the Constitution of India by other Pol. Parties). However, the party leaders have stated their opposition of the Bill.

All other political parties have expressed their opposition of the Bill and the need to form a united front.

Protests against CAB spearheaded by NGOCC had subsided only temporarily and the situation still vulnerable if new Government to be formed after GPE makes fresh move to pass the CAB.
