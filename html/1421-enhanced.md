The Assam Forest officials have dismantled all the 5 (five) huts which have been illegally constructed by some people of Assam and also uprooted saplings of betel nut planted on the disputed area. |


****** Briefly, the background of all the above incident lies in the fact that the people of Mizoram/ Government of Mizoram do not accept the boundary demarcation as pronounced in the Inner Line Notification of 1930 and 1933, a boundary which was imposed on the people of Mizoram, when the erstwhile Lushai Hills District was administered by the Government of Assam with scant regards for historical truths and sentiment of the people. This boundary was neither accepted by the then Lushai Hills Autonomous District Council nor any subsequent administrative entities. The State Government affirms territorial integrity of Mizoram within its historically recognized border and underscored that that the demarcations as indicated in Inner Line Notification of 1875 is the rightful claims of Mizoram and an inalienable part of the State.**

**Note : As for the sizes of area encroached, Revenue Department and Forest Department may kindly be approached by appropriate Authority please.**
