****Subject: Recent Developments in Thaidawr Tlang Dispute and Security Concerns.****

**Introduction:**

The Thaidawr Tlang area, a disputed territory between Mizoram and Tripura, has been a focal point of tension due to overlapping territorial claims and recent incidents involving infrastructure development and security measures.

This report provides a detailed analysis of two recent developments: a meeting held by the Tripura Tourism Minister at Eden Tourist Lodge on May 30, 2025, and the establishment of a new Tripura Police checkpoint on June 2, 2025, near Phuldungsei village. These events follow the recent bombing of a Tripura Tourism Department building, raising concerns about security, inter-state coordination, and the potential for escalating tensions.

_1. Meeting at Eden Tourist Lodge, Vanghmun, Tripura (May 30, 2025)_

On May 30, 2025, a high-level meeting was convened at Eden Tourist Lodge, Vanghmun, Tripura, chaired by Shri Sushanta Chowdhury. Hon'ble Minister, Tourism, Govt. of Tripura. Attendees included the MLA of Kanchanpur, the Executive Member of the MDC, Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council, the Secretary and Director of the Tripura Tourism Department, the District Magistrate (DM) and Superintendent of Police (SP) of North Tripura, and representatives from the Mizo Convention and Phuldungsei Village Council.

_Key Points from the Meeting:_

• Tourism Project Timeline and Security: The Minister emphasized the completion of ongoing tourism projects at Thaidawr Tlang by September 2025, with a budget allocation of â‚¹70 crores for tourism development in Jampui Hill, starting with Thaidawr Tlang. He underscored the need for robust security measures to protect these projects, particularly in light of the recent bombing of a tourism building.

• Border Dispute Acknowledgment: The Minister acknowledged the ongoing boundary dispute, noting that the final resolution rests with the Union Home Ministry and the Boundary Commission. He stated that project activities would continue pending the Commission's decision, which could impact the project's outcome.

• Community Engagement: The Minister urged local communities to support the tourism initiatives but controversially criticized residents for reporting incidents to Mizoram authorities instead of Tripura Police. The North Tripura DM clarified that such actions were not inappropriate, as both states' police forces are conducting joint investigations.

• Mizo Convention's Position: Representatives from the Mizo Convention advocated for a diplomatic resolution of the border dispute between Mizoram and Tripura to ensure smooth project implementation and prevent further incidents.

_Analysis:_ The meeting highlights Tripura's determination to advance its tourism agenda in the disputed area despite unresolved territorial claims. The Minister's remarks about local reporting practices risk straining inter-state relations, particularly as Mizoram maintains that Thaidawr Tlang falls within its jurisdiction. The Mizo Convention's call for dialogue aligns with Mizoram's stance that infrastructure development in disputed areas should be paused until the boundary issue is resolved.

_2. Establishment of Tripura Police Checkpoint (June 2, 2025)_

On June 2, 2025, local residents reported the establishment of a new Tripura Police checkpoint along the approach road to Phuldungsei, near the recently bombed Tripura Tourism building. The construction, obscured by heavy rainfall, went unnoticed until the afternoon of June 2. Key observations include :-

• Location and Personnel: The checkpoint is situated close to the damaged tourism facility. Four Tripura State Rifles (TSR) personnel are stationed near the site, with approximately 20 additional TSR personnel deployed at an abandoned BSNL facility on the southern outskirts of Phuldungsei.

• Purpose and Authority: The operational directives and authority for the checkpoint's construction are under investigation. The timing, following the May 27, 2025, bombing, suggests a security response, but the lack of prior communication with Mizoram authorities raises concerns about unilateral actions in a disputed area.

• Security Implications: The deployment of TSR personnel and the checkpoint's establishment could be perceived as an assertion of Tripura's administrative control over Thaidawr Tlang, potentially escalating tensions with Mizoram.

**Conclusion:**

The developments at Thaidawr Tlang, including the Eden Tourist Lodge meeting and the new Tripura Police checkpoint, underscore the complexities of the Mizoram-Tripura border dispute. While Tripura's tourism initiatives aim to capitalize on the region's potential, unilateral actions in a disputed area risk undermining inter-state harmony. The CID (Special Branch), will continue to monitor the situation, and provide updates to ensure peace and stability in the region.
