****State Level Standing Committee (Indo-Bangladesh Border) on 17.01.2025 (Friday) at 11:00 AM at Chief Secretary’s Conference Room, 2nd Floor, MINECO****

Mizoram shares 318 Km long international boundary with Bangladesh, These porous international borders with Bangladesh served as important routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs. The porous border areas have also widely encouraged other criminal activities like abduction/ kidnapping of Indian citizens by Bangladesh based insurgent groups.

In order to curb the infiltration, smuggling and other anti-national activities from across the Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government has undertaken the construction of fencing along this border.

The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was 344.41 Km out of which about 70% work have been completed.

According to Mizoram State Boundary Committee, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram are now within Bangladesh side of the border due to irresponsibility of the construction companies who are fencing the Mizoram- Bangladesh border. The Boundary Committee also found that the fences pass through the middle of 20 other villages.

Proper management of borders, which is vital to the national security, presents many challenges and includes coordination and concerted action by the administrative, diplomatic, security, intelligence, legal, regulatory and economic agencies of the country to secure the frontiers and serve its best interests.

Approach and practices of border management vary from one border to another, based on the security perceptions and relationship with the neighbouring country.

Mizoram has a long international boundary with two countries (512 kms with Myanmar and 318 kms with Bangladesh). There are 3 (three) Battalions of BSF deployed at Indo-Bangladesh border. In addition, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) along the border supplementing the central armed forces.

****Indo-Bangladesh Border-Issues relating to Mizoram****

**1). Bawm/Bangladesh Refugee:-**

**Brief history :-**

  A military operation against Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) by Bangladesh Army on 15.11.2022 at Chhaihkhiang Village, Bangladesh resulted in the mass exodus of civilians, mainly the Bawm community during which 272 civilians including women and children fled their villages to take shelter inside Mizoram.

Subsequent military operations led to 3 major influxes of Bawm civilians into Lawngtlai District of Mizoram which briefly halted during the Election process of Bangladesh in January 2024 and the peace talk between the KNA and Bangladesh Government. However, the looting of Banks and arms by KNA on 2nd and 3rd April 2024 resulted in an intensified operation against the KNA leading to more influxes of Bawm community into Mizoram.

The latest Bawm refugees numbering 93 persons who entered Damdep-II Village, Lawngtlai District, Mizoram on the night of 04.07.2024 were evacuated by BSF personnel to Crocodile Camp, Kamtuli in an attempt to deport the refugees. However, with the intervention of the State Government, the 93 Bawm refugees who were joined by another 33 Bawm refugees at Chhippui BSF BOP were safely transported to Chamdur Village on the morning of 08.07.2024.

**2). Bangladesh Internal Conflict and recent clashes in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) area:-**

******The reservation of 30% of Government Job for descendants of freedom fighters in Bangladesh sparks a students’ protest across universities in Bangladesh. As the protest intensified, thousands of protesters stormed and ransacked the official residence of the then Bangladesh Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina demanding the resignation of Seikh Hasina who subsequently fled the country on 5th, August. Three days later, an interim government under Nobel**

Prize winner Mohammad Yunus was formed in the violence torn Bangladesh to bring back normalcy.

The situation escalated leading to violent clashes between the Bengali settlers and the minority community in the CHT which reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least three people and destruction of numerous homes of the Chakma community. Acknowledging the reported atrocities of the indigenous Chakmas in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the Chakma community of Mizoram under the aegis of Central Young Chakma Association along with all the civil society organizations of the Chakma community organized a protest rally at Kamalanagar, Mizoram on 22.09.2024 followed by a candle lighting rally on the same night. The protest rally was participated by almost 2500 protesters who demanded the intervention of the Indian Government in the reported atrocities against the indigenous Chakma community of Bangladesh.

**5). Indo-Bangladesh border fencing:-**

Mizoram shares 318 Km long international boundary with Bangladesh. These porous international borders with Bangladesh served as important routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs.
