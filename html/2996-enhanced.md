No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/298

Dated: 6th May, 2019.

1. MZP President L. Ramdinliana Renthlei accompanied by B. Vanlaltana, Vice President and two Secretaries went to Bairabi (Zophai) today, i.e. 6.5.2019, and visited the disputed site. They were joined by Zosangliana Rokhum, President, MZP Hqrs., Kolasib and leaders of Bairabi MZP Sub-Hqrs. A banner claiming construction site for ‘Zofate Chawlhbuk’ was displayed on a tree branch today, a move opposed by the Joint V/C and NGOs of Bairabi, who on 4.5.2019 served a notice to the MZP Sub-Hqrs., Bairabi, urging the MZP General Hqrs. to exercise restraint in the area so as not to violate MHA’s direction to maintain a ‘status quo’ while efforts are on to find a solution to this contentious issue.

 A joint meeting of Joint V/C and NGOs was convened later in the afternoon at 1:30 p.m. at the office of Sub-Deputy Commissioner, Bairabi which was chaired by Pu Samuel Zodinsanga, SDC and attended by 17 (seventeen) persons. Leaders of MZP General Hqrs. however did not attend the meeting. The meeting was learnt to have observed the MZP’s display of banner at Zophai uncalled for. The NGO leaders are intending to remove the banner without informing the MZP leaders of their intention, it is learnt.

 The MZP General Hqrs., consequent to their display of banner earlier today has issued a Press Release staking a claim that their intended construction site at Zophai is located inside a land belonging to the first Chief Minister of Mizoram, Pu Ch. Chhunga (L) and the site had been given to the MZP by his widow, Pi Lalrothangi, urging the Government of Mizoram to protect the “Site Banner”. MZP also asserted their commitment to construct ‘Zofate Chawlhbuk’, regretting the V/C’s appeal, and asked them to render support instead. MZP in its Press Release also urges the Government to enable Core Committee to expedite action to solve Mizoram-Assam boundary issue.

2. There has been report of hassles as NGOs of Garmura, opposite Bairabi on Assam side stopped and stranded some commercial vehicles plying between Assam-Mizoram highway which appeared to be reciprocal of checking of transport vehicles carried out by YMA and MZP on Bairabi side following an alert issued by NGOs on human trafficking. The stranded vehicles however had been released as a result of intervention by Bairabi and Ramnathpur Police, and normalcy restored. 

 Situation under close watch.
