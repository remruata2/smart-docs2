****High demand for Baktawng town utensils products**: Chhuanthar, which is a sub village within Baktawng town area has been producing aluminium utensils for a considerable period of time. Previously, there were dozens of families in Chhuanthar who were engaged in the manufacturing of these products, however, presently, there are only five families who still retained the trade. One of their products in particular, "Baktawng Cooker" is being demanded in great numbers especially from the neighbouring states of Nagaland and Meghalaya. However, the output of these cooker cannot meet the require demands as some of the craftsmen who were occupied in the moulding of these cookers shifted to furniture works after the Covid-19 pandemic hampered their business connection with other states for two consecutive years.**
