**Land dispute between LRS and EFCC:** For the proposed widening project of National Highway NH-06 and NH-306, which is in between Vairengte and Sairang town, works cannot be started yet due to the land dispute between Land Revenue &amp; Settlement(LRS) Department and Environment, Forest &amp; Climate Change (EFCC)Department.

 This project which is under Ministry of Road Transports &amp; Highways (MoRTH) will be undertaken by National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL). According to officials of NHIDCL, acquisition of land cannot be done for the proposed four-lane widening works of these National Highway as both LRS and EFCC departments each claims the affected lands to be under the jurisdiction of their department. However, they expected the matter to be resolved soon as negotiations were already done with the consent of the Chief Minister, they added.
