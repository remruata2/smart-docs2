Subj.: Requirement of Fund for Peace Dialogue between Govt. of Mizoram and HPC(D).

Sir,

 I beg to state that 5 (five) rounds of Peace Dialogue between Govt. of Mizoram and HPC(D) had already been conducted since 10.8.2016 and the Peace Dialogue has shown positive direction. As per the schedule, the next round of Peace Dialogue would be held at Political Level tentatively before Christmas i.e., 25th December, 2017. The proposed Political Level Peace Dialogue is expected to last another 2 (two) rounds of talk which will be followed by signing of Memorandum of Settlement in a Grand Ceremony scheduled to be held at Sakawrdai, the exact date for holding Grand Reception function at Sakawrdai is yet to be finalized.

 In this connection, I would like to mention that the allocated fund amounting to Rs. 11.5 lakhs for meeting the expenses of Peace Dialogues has been more or less exhausted towards payment of Delegates’ Air fare, accommodation, fooding, conveyance, etc etc. Keeping in mind the proposed 2 (two) rounds of Peace Dialogue at Political level, Grand reception of HPC(D) cadres, laying down of Arms, Signing of Memorandum of Settlement, organizing Public feast, etc etc, it is anticipated that at least Rs. 10 (ten) lakhs would be required to meet the impending expenses so as to conduct the remaining Peace Dialogue smoothly.

 It is, therefore, requested that additional fund amounting to Rs. 10 (ten) lakhs may kindly be allocated from concerned Authority for the reason as stated above.

 Submitted for favour of kind information and further necessary action please.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
