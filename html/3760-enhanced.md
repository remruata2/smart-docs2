****BRIEF NOTES ON HMAR PEOPLES CONVENTION (DEMOCRATIC) [HPC(D)]****

**1. Background :**

 The Hmars, an ethnic group of Mizoram mostly settled in the North Eastern part of the State have been aspiring for a separate administrative set up mainly due to the instigation of the elite and educated members of the community who propounded that the Hmars are a separate ethnic community with distinct culture as compared to the Mizo speaking populace of Mizoram. However, it may be mentioned here that the Hmars were never regarded as a distinct ethnic community, historically and culturally. Their only distinctiveness is that they spoke the Hmar dialect which is however having very close affinity to Mizo - a dialect of the Lushei - which is now accepted as the official language of Mizoram. The Hmars also spread-out as far as Haflong in North Cachar Hills District of Assam and the Churachandpur District of Manipur. It may be mentioned here that the settlement of the Hmars in the adjoining areas of Manipur and Assam among other ethnic groups with distinct cultures and customs gradually made them ethnically self-conscious and vulnerable. This sentiment of alienation gave birth to political aspirations among the elite section of the community culminating in the formation of political platform such as the Hmar National Union (HNU) etc. in 1957 with the proclaimed objective of preserving the democratic rights, culture and ethnic identity of the Hmars within their dominated areas of Manipur and Assam.

**2. Demand for Autonomous District Council by HPC :**

 The Hmars being a dominant ethnic group of Mizoram have never felt the need nor aspired for any special political status for their community in Mizoram. They were a secured and contented community. However, mainly due to the influence of the Hmars living outside the State, politically ambitious section of the community started propounding the need for preserving their democratic rights, culture and ethnic identity. In 1986, the Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) was formed with the sole objective of the creation of an Autonomous District Council (ADC) for the Hmars within Mizoram. Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent and unlawful activities like abduction, extortion of money, attack on Mizoram Police personnel etc. and thus jeopardizing the law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area.

**3. Signing of Peace Accord :**

 The Government of Mizoram eventually managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants through the courageous and dedicated efforts of Mizoram Police which resulted into the signing of a Peace Accord between the Government of Mizoram and HPC on 27th July 1994. The HPC militants surrendered formally to the Govt. of Mizoram as per the provision of this Accord and these persons were given financial grants for their rehabilitation etc. The Govt. of Mizoram also agreed to set up the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) for the socio-economic upliftment of the people living in the Hmar dominated areas. Accordingly, Adhoc Chairman and members constituting the council were even appointed by the Govt. of Mizoram from among the leaders of the erstwhile HPC set up. Peace was thus restored in Mizoram after the signing of the Accord.

**4. Formation of HPC (D) :**

 However, in spite of signing of the Peace Accord, there were still a disgruntled section of the HPC set up, led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate, the then General Secretary of the HPC who did not accept the Peace Accord. Lalhmingthanga Sanate formed a militant outfit called the Hmar Peoples Convention -Democratic (HPC(D)) in 1995 with its nerve centre at Hmarkhawlian (Lakhipur) in Cachar District of Assam. The HPC(D) was formed with the political objective of renewing demand for ADC under the active patronage of NSCN(I-M). In 1997, about 15-20 cadres under the command of S/S Commander-in-Chief Ropuia were sent to NSCN(IM) base camp in Bangladesh for training. They also received arms assistance from them.

 In the meantime, a new underground outfit called the Hmar Revolutionary Force (HRF) was formed in 1996 with LZ Hrangchal, former S/S Chief Marshal of HPC as its leader. It may be noted that the HPC did not surrender all their arms to the Government of Mizoram in 1994. They have secretly kept about 14 (fourteen) numbers of sophisticated weapons un-surrendered which they claimed were borrowed from the NSCN(I/M), and that the weapons were already returned to the NSCN(IM). The facts remained, however, that these weapons were meant for future use in the pretext of safeguarding the Hmar tribes. They were also in friendly terms with the PREPAK and UNLF. The group however, surrendered before Govt. of Mizoram in 1999 after experiencing armed conflict with rival HPC (D).

**5. Objective :**

 The purported objective of the HPC (D) over the years has changed from an autonomous district council covering the north and north eastern Mizoram to an independent Hmar State consisting of the Hmar inhabited areas of Mizoram, Manipur and Assam.

**6.** **Areas of Operation:**

 The HPC (D) are active primarily in the north eastern areas of (i.e. some portions of Kolasib District and Aizawl District which are dominated by the Hmars) Mizoram, the Hmar dominated areas of Churachandpur District in Manipur and the Cachar and North Cachar Hill Districts of Assam.

**STRENGTH AND STATUS OF RIVAL GROUPS OF HPC(D) OUTFITS**

**1. Lalhmingthanga Sanate :**

 He is the founding President of HPC(D) which was formed in 1996. Till today, he has not surrendered to the Government and is presently residing in Hmarkhawlian village, Assam with his family and a handful of his followers.

 When a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) way back in 2018, Lalhmingthanga Sanate designated his HPC(D) splinter faction as 'HPC(D) (President's Group)' and did not participated in the said MoS. During that time, his group consisted of around 13 cadres with an estimated 4/5 weapons holding. However, by February 2020, 11(eleven) of his cadres deserted him and joined HPC(D)- General Headquarters Sinlung Group, who are under the leadership of Lalkhama @ LK Hmar.

 At the moment, it is believed that there are only a cadre or two under the command of Lalhmingthanga Sanate, who himself has a great inclination towards surrendering himself to Government of Mizoram. At the same time, he is expected to have a couple of demands before finally surrendering.

**2. Lalthansanga @ LT Sanga @ Sang Samsei-a :**

 'HPC(D), Manipur Region' is a group led by Lalthansanga, whose area of operation is around Churachandpur town, Manipur. This group is affiliated to United People Front (UPF), a collaboration of various insurgent groups of Manipur and their leader, Lalthansanga is one of the members of Joint Monitors Group of UPF.

 Even after the signing of accord between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) in 2018, this group still retained some arms and continued collection of 'Donations' inside Manipur. It may also be mentioned that several of the HPC(D) cadres, who received rehabilitation package as a result of the 2018 Accord joined this outfit again.

 Recently, due to their demands of money and provision from Mr.Vungzagin, MLA, 56th ST, Thanlawm Constituency, Manipur, 15 of its cadres were arrested by the police. However, they were later released on bail, with Lalchuailova @ LC Hmar, Council Member and two others still in Police Custody, though. Presently, this group consisted of around 30-40 cadres.

**3. Lalkhama @ LK Hmar :**

 The Group under Lalkhama designated themselves as 'HPC(D) General Headquarters Sinlung'

 Established in April 2019, this group was formed by former HPC(D) cadres who came over ground after the Peace Accord of 2018. These members/cadres blamed their leaders of misappropriating Rs.50,40,000/- which were deducted from Rehabilitation Packages of 63 cadres @ Rs.80,000/- each meant for distribution to the bereaved families of cadres who had died earlier as a result of their cause.

 There are an estimated 20-30 cadres in this group under the command of their self-style Commander-in-chief, Lalkhama @ LK Hmar, whose family are presently residing in Saikot, Churachandpur, Manipur. Their area of operation is in and around Churachanpur town of Manipur.

 It may be estimated that there will be around 4/5 SBBL or AK 47 rifles in their arsenal.

 The members of this group are mainly from former HPC(D) cadres who had surrender to Government of Mizoram in 2018. Apart from them, except for one or two new recruits from Manipur, not many have newly joined this HPC(D) faction.

**Conclusion :**

 

 So far, from the information received till date, there has been neither threat nor intimidation from these three groups against Government of Mizoram, its officials or any individuals inside Mizoram.
