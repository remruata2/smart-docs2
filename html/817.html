<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">When Myanmarese Nationals are apprehended for commission of criminal activities, including trans-border trafficking of contraband items and war like stores, registration of cases and action thereon comes within the purview of concerned police stations and state government administration. Law enforcing agencies maintain strict vigil to intercept the foreigners overstaying in India. Central government is vested with powers to deport foreign nationals under sec 3(2)(c) of Foreigners Act, 1946. The powers to identify and deport foreign nationals illegally staying have also been delegated to the state government. Detection and deportation of such illegal immigrants is a continuous process. The procedure includes sending back then and there, the illegal immigrants who are intercepted at the borders while entering India illegally.</span></span></span></span></p>

In case the Magistrate directed the concerned Officer In-Charge of a Police Station for their deportation, the Officer In-Charge upon consultation with his superior officers made arrangement, wherein the foreigners to be deported are escorted by police personnel upto Zokhawthar village of the Indo-Myanmar border. The foreigners are then let loose, pushed back and ensured that they have crossed over the border. Generally, this has been done without the knowledge and intervention of the Myanmarese Government.</span></span></span></span></p>
