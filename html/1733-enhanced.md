**Reports regarding movements/activities of Arakan Army(AA) within Mizoram :**

 Prior to the year 2018/2019, Arakan Army had established their camp inside Mizoram along the Indo(Mizoram)-Myanmar border areas. As such, they often, discreetly, ventured inside the bordering town and villages inside southern parts of Mizoram state for provisions and medical supplies.

 However, when in 2019,Myanmar Army launched an intensive operation against these Arakan Army cadres, it was not possible for the Arakan Army cadres to enter Indian territory as the Indian Army and Assam Rifles, anticipating this crack down, deployed huge numbers of their troops along the Mizoram-Myanmar borders. Nevertheless, a couple of injured/wounded Arakan Army cadres were smuggled inside Mizoram for medical treatment.

 By the end of 2019, as a result of these operations conducted by Myanmar Army with the concentration of large numbers of Indian Army and Assam Rifles personnel along the border, the situation became desperate for many of the Arakan Army cadres who have no choice but to move towards Bangladesh while a considerable amount of them moved deeper inside Myanmar territory. It is believed that , with a certain amount of understanding with Bangladesh Army, Arakan Army set up their camp in Bandarban district, inside Bangladesh.

 From the beginning of 2020, there has been no reports of activities of Arakan Army cadres inside Mizoram territory. Not only this, Arakan Army had completely ceased using Mizoram as a transit route as their nearest camp from the border is located at Moilewah village ,under the command of self-style Colonel Moy Tum Kyaw, which is around 25 kilometers from the border.

**Arakanese in Mizoram:**

****Along the Mizoram-Myanmar border areas, the following villages are predominantly inhabited by Arakanese/Arakanese Rakhine tribe - (i) Hmawngbuchhuah village (ii) Model village (iii) Zochachhuah village (iv) Kakichhuah village (v) Banduk Banga village. As more than half of the population of these villages are considered to be sympathizers of Arakan Army and their cause, it is evident that AA cadres can procure their requirements through or using these villagers without having to enter Mizoram themselves.

**Conclusion:**

 It may be worth mentioning that, to enter Bangladesh, Arakan Army cadres need not entered Mizoram as direct access to Bangladesh from their camp at Moilewah village is much more easier and safer.

 As for the prevention of movement of such international rebel within Mizoram, monitoring of the above mentioned Rakhine dominated villages by Mizoram police in close coordination with the Assam Rifles is essential so as to deprived Arakan Army cadres from utilizing the village and villagers themselves.

 As far as the Arakan Army is concerned, one other point that may be put into consideration is the Kaladan Multi Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP). As this route is scheduled to pass through the operational areas of Arakan Army, demands have been, previously, made to the construction company by Arakan Army which have not been complied to till today. Obstruction and even hampering of the progress of this KMMTTP due to the non compliances to the demands of Arakan Army by the concern construction company cannot be ruled out at the moment.
