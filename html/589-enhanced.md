  The above 53 BLFM cadres who surrendered between March- August, 2006 were resettled at Pangbalkawn but most of them except 6 cadres left the place for Bru refugee camp, Tripura complaining lack of free land for Jhum cultivations.

  On 26.10.2006, the Arms Laying / Oath Taking Ceremony of 804 BLFM surrenderees was held at Sidon Transit Camp (Tuipuibari) at 11:00AM and at Zodin Transit Camp (Damparengpui) at 1:30 PM.

  They were given Rs. 30,000/- each as Housing Assistance, Rs. 20,000/- as Cash Assistance and Rs. 3000/- for construction of jungle hut and Rs. 2000/- each for transportation which is less than what the BNLF cadres were paid. During the meeting on 28.4.2009 at CS Conference Room, Aizawl, Jt. Secretary Home Pu Naveen Verma said that the BLFM cadres will be given the same treatment as the Ex-BNLF cadres which could be presumed that additional sanction of Rs. 30,000/- each of the Ex-BLFM cadres is likely to be sanction by the Central Govt.

During last part of May to the middle part of June, 2009 a strong 64 cadres of SPLA had surrendered to the 3rd Assam Rifle at Churrachandpur, Manipur with weapons. They were brought to Mizoram by the AR authority and arrived at the State capital on 16.7.2009. Though mentioned them as **Surrender**, the Mizoram Govt. however, did not accept them as such their return to the mainstream was rather termed as ‘**Home Coming’.**Since the Mizoram Govt. did not consider them as surrenderees, they were not given any sort of rehabilitation and allowed them to proceed to their respective home.**
