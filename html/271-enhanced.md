| **SI No.** | **Name & Designation** | **Assessment of Threat Perception.** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Pu Hiphei Hon’ble Speaker | No immediate threat has been perceived till date. Pu Hiphei is satisfied with the present level of security provided to him. However, the security of Hon’ble Speaker needs to be strengthen during his visit to his constituency as certain outfits of Myanmar origin occasionally enter some part of his constituency. |
|  | Pu R.Lalzirliana Hon’ble Home Minister | The Hon’ble Home Minister who is presently residing at Armed Veng locality did not have any known coercion or imminent threat from any person. Duty performance of each House guards and PSOs are also found satisfactory.  |
|  | Pu R. Romawia, Hon’ble Minister | With three (3) Personal Security Officers (PSOs) and proper House guards, security arrangement for the moment is found satisfactory in respect to Pu R. Romawia. Nevertheless, it is opinioned that improvements in a way of smartness, general conduct and efficiency of PSOs are still required.  |
|  | Pu Lalsawta, Hon’ble Minister | No immediate threat has been perceived till date against Pu Lalsawta, Hon’ble Minister who is presently residing at Mission Vengthlang, Aizawl. His personal guards and House guards are found to be efficient in performance of their duties. Security arrangement has been observed to be sufficient for the time being.  |
|  | Pu H. Rohluna, Hon’ble Minister | Presently, three (3) Personal Security Officers are allotted to guard Pu H. Rohluna, Hon’ble Minister.Although his security arrangement has been found sufficiant for his movement inside the city area, it was suggested that his security cover may be strengthen/ enhanced during his visit/tour to his constituency as some part of the east side of the constituency which is bordering Myanmar falls within the operated area of Zo- Revolutionary Army(ZRA), an underground militant group of Myanmar origin.  |
|  | Pu Zodintluanga, Hon’ble Minister | No imminent threat has been perceived against Pu Zodintluanga. However, it is suggested that the general conduct and efficiency of PSOs need to be improved. Moreover, small arms i.e. Pistols/Revolvers alloted to PSO were reportedly old and unreliable. It is therefore suggested that immediate inspection be conducted to check the reliability of the weapons i.e. Pistols/Revolvers allotted to the PSOs. |
|  | Pu John Rotluangliana, Hon’ble Minister | No imminent threat has been perceived against Pu John Rotluangliana, Hon’ble Minister . He is presently having three (3) PSOs. In his case, it is recommended that the PSOs be instructed to perform their duty even at night and be available for the Minister. It is also highly recommended to strengthen the security of the Minister whenever he is visiting his constituency as some part of his constituency remained under sensitive areas.  |
|  | Pu PC Lalthanliana, Hon’ble Minister | No imminent threat has been perceived against Pu PC Lalthanliana. However, it is suggested that strict access control measure may be taken against any visitors at his office and residence.  |
|  | Pu Lal Thanzara, Hon’ble Minister | No imminent threat has been perceived against is provided Pu Lal Thanzara, Hon’ble Minister. Three (3) PSOs are staying with him during office hour i.e. 9:00 Am – 5:00 Pm including holiday. Armed house guards are on duty around the clock while PSOs performed their duty only during office hour which is due to lack of accommodation/quarters for them. Armed house guard as well as PSOs would be more efficient if quarters or accommodation could be provided to them.  |
|  | Pu Lalrinmawia Ralte, Hon’ble Minister | No imminent threat has been perceived against Pu. Lalrinmawia Ralte, Hon’ble Minister. It is learnt that the PSOs normally do not turn up at the Minister’s resident while he is on tour. It is further suggested that continuous protection towards the Minister must be given by the PSOs even on Sunday morning .  |
|  | Pu C. Ngunlianchunga, Hon’ble Minister | Pu C. Ngunlianchunga is currently provided with three (3) PSOs and static House Guard. The threat level perceived with regard to the Minister is minimal. The PSOs are constantly guarding the Minister i.e. through night and day, atleast one PSO always stays at his resident even when he is on tour. At present, his security arrangement has been found satisfactory.  |
|  | DR. B.D. Chakma, Hon’ble Minister | Dr.BD Chakma has never encountered with threat intimation. His security arrangement which comprises of armed house guards and three (3) PSOs is found sufficient for the time being. It is recommended that the Minister be strengthened when he is in and around Chawngte due to the recent outbreak of violence in Chawngte.  |


In general, the security conditions and arrangement towards the above mentioned Hon’ble Speakers, Hon’ble Home Minister and other Council of Ministers are found to be satisfactory. Since direct/indirect threat and intimidation had never been heard or received by anyone of them, it is felt unnecessary to bring up new level of security arrangement in terms of armed house guard and PSOs. But as indicated above, some PSOs guarded the officials around the clock while some PSOs guarded them only during office hours. In some cases, PSOs left the officials every Sunday morning leaving them unprotected and some PSOs never show up at the official’s resident while the official is on tour. It is therefore recommended that a clear-cut Duty guidelines/protocols for the PSOs be made/provided, which may as well contain general rules of conducts (i.e. Dos and Don’ts for PSOs) so as to maintain similar pattern of duty for every PSOs who are gurding Protected Persons/ officials.

In regard to the VIPs’ General Security in and around their office i.e. Govt. Secretariat Complex, Aizawl, it is felt that the armed guard sentry post should be strengthen by erecting at least three more sentry posts at suitable corners outside the office which now have only one sentry gate at the main-gate. If possible, allotment of one platoon of armed police for this purpose is suggested. It was also learnt that there are four (4) exit points at the secretariat building’s ground floor each of which are equipped with DFMD, but as a matter of fact, only the main entrance i.e. the main door is guarded with police personnel, the other three minor exits are not specifically guarded. It is strongly suggested that static armed guard as well as security police personnel be posted at each of three unguarded exit.

The vehicles parking arrangement at the New Secretariat Complex is also found highly unsystematic. It is suggested that more systematic arrangement of vehicles parking and entry at the main entrance be arranged at the earliest. Smooth flow of traffic should also be kept which is necessary for swift and speedy evacuation of the building’s premises in an emergency situation.
