Dated: 20th November, 2019.

  Leaders of Bru NGOs, viz., A. Sawibunga, President, MBDPF; Phillip Apeto, General Secretary, MBIDM; Chohsarai, Spokeperson, MBIDM and Vipin Kumar, President, BTDS, who have gone to New Delhi on 7.11.2019 to meet Shri. Amit Shah, Hon’ble Union Home Minister, returned to Bru Relief Camps on 16.11.2019.

 It is learnt that the above Bru NGO leaders failed to meet the Union Home Minister or other central officials due to failure to have appointments on time. However, they have submitted their Memorandum addressed to the union Home Minister at Central Secretariat.

 The memorandum listed out the below 4 (four) demands of the Brus residing in Relief Camps and seek immediate interventions of the Government of India :-

1. Each Bru family is being offered only total of 30x40 sq feet land to build house, kitchen, toilet, bathroom and cultivation area in Mizoram after repatriation. This is inhuman, inadequate and not possible to live in a rural area.
2. Over 30,000 displaced Brus will be resettled in 77 villages in Mizoram which is not suitable for survival and development with distinct identity. They should be settled in a compact area.
3. In view of communal attacks on Brus and other minorities in Mizoram, the Brus should be provided security by the Central security forces in their villages.
4. The proposal for a Permanent Development Project as submitted by them on 21st October 2019 to Shri. AP Maheswari, Special Secretary (IS), MHA, should be initiated.

 In the meantime, 8 (eight) leaders of Bru NGOs, comprising of MBDPCC, BDWO, MBIDM &amp; Bru Upa Pawl (Bru Senior Citizen), met Shri. Jishnu Dev Varma, Dy.CM and Shri. Narendra Chandra Debbarma, Revenue Minister, Government of Tripura, at Agartala, Tripura on 14.11.2019. The Bru leaders were learnt to have informed the two dignitaries that Brus are unwilling to return to Mizoram unless their demands are met and they have rather chosen to settle permanently in Tripura and urged them to provide suitable areas for their settlement. They were told that necessary discussions will be held with Bru NGO leaders after the end of scheduled repatriation process, i.e. 30.11.2019.

 As per information received, leaders of MBDPCC intend to convene a Press Conference after the completion of Repatriation Roadmap to highlight the various reasons in support of their decision to settle permanently in Tripura.

 Situation is under close watch.
