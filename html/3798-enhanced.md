****REGIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIES CONFERENCE - 2021****

****FOR NORTH EAST****

**I. CHINESE ACTIVITIES IN THE NORTH EAST**

 Apart from the State of Arunachal Pradesh, no other States of the North East shares International border with China. However, due to the recent Military Coup in Myanmar and the subsequent Civil Disobedience Movement organised in protest against it, the following points may be considered :

**(1)** As China could not yet condemn or criticized the Military takeover of Myanmar, the activities of Chinese agents inside Myanmar, right up to the bordering States of North East India should be monitored.

**(2)** Presently, Myanmar is on the brink of Civil War as neither the military nor the protestors are trying to back down. As such, if the situation in Myanmar escalate like Syria as a result of ethnic Burmese civilian taking arms against the military, the possibilities of the intervention of China militarily in Myanmar in support of military cannot be ruled out, which, undoubtedly, would increase the influx of refugees to the bordering North East Indian States.

****(3)** If there is a direct Chinese military involvement in Myanmar as a result of the prevailing situation, State governments of the bordering North East States along with the border guarding forces have to be beefed up along the porous Indo-Myanmar borders.**

**II. EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF INDO-MYANMAR BORDER**

****(1)**According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of International border with Myanmar along which are scattered around 30 - 40 small villages in Mizoram side. These International border posts with Myanmar are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.**

**(2)** Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be a great assets for the government and the border guard alike.

**(3)** Having a low profile close ties with ethnic leaders of Chin Hills and Arakan-Rakhine States may also be invaluable for sharing cross-border information.

**(4)** The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime(FMR) between India and Myanmar allows Myanmarese nationals to enter up to 16 kms. into Mizoram Territory without any Visa restrictions and this may facilitate unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the border of Mizoram and Myanmar.

According to Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram is having 496.531 kms. porous international borders with Myanmar which are vulnerable to use by Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs and infiltration. Besides, the Look East Policy actively pursued by Central and State Government is bound to bring our neighbours, i.e. Myanmar and other Asian Countries closer to our country in general and Mizoram in particular in all kinds of economic activity.

If fencing is to be erected from 150 - 500 yards from the ‘Zero Line’, a large number of villages located close to the border and all fertile plains will be fenced out.

1. _Beefing up of Border Security_ :

The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime(FMR) between India and Myanmar allows Myanmarese nationals to enter up to 16 kms. into Mizoram Territory without any Visa restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border and BSF guard Indo-Bangladesh border. Mizoram shared 496.531 Kms. with Myanmar and 319.791 Kms. with Bangladesh. In order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the border of Mizoram and Myanmar.

1. _Setting up Battalion Headquarters_ :

The 3rd Indian Reserve Battalion currently deployed at Assam is planning to set up its Headquarters at Thingkah, Lawngtlai District. Construction work of infrastructural need is going on, and it is expected to be completed soon. Once they are stationed at the new headquarters, they will be an important asset to maintain peace and security in the southern part of Mizoram. They would be very useful in Maintenance of Law &amp; Order and guarding of international boundary and cross border crime.

****Write up on Border Management Issues-****

****Bangladesh-India & India-Myanmar****

Proper management of borders, which is vital to the national security, presents many challenges and includes coordination and concerted action by the administrative, diplomatic, security, intelligence, legal, regulatory and economic agencies of the country to secure the frontiers and serve its best interests.

 Approach and practices of border management vary from one border to another, based on the security perceptions and relationship with the neighbouring country.

Mizoram has a long international boundary with two countries (512 kms with Myanmar and 318 kms with Bangladesh). There are 3 (three) Battalions of Assam Rifles deployed at the Indo-Myanmar border and 3 (three) Battalions of BSF deployed along Indo-Bangladesh border. In addition, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) along the border supplementing the central armed forces.

_Factors affecting Indo (Mizoram)-Bangladesh and Indo(Mizoram)- Myanmar Border Management_

(i) The porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh served as an important routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs.

(ii) The porous border areas have widely encouraged other criminal activities like abduction/kidnapping of Indian citizens by Bangladesh based insurgent groups.

(iii) The porous border area also open for influx of foreign nationals from Bangladesh i.e Chakmas/Bengali Muslim and Myanmarese from Myanmar into the state of Mizoram. The junction of Mizoram, Bangladesh and Myanmar is also vulnerable for infiltration point of Muslim Rohingyas from Myanmar.

(iv) The recent increase in the smuggling of Gold and contraband drugs like Pseudoephedrine, Methamphetamine across the border has called for immediate and proper attention. In this regard, Mizoram Police has made several recoveries.

(v) Identical tribes live on both sides of the boundary pose difficulty in restricting the movement of the people.

_Major Initiatives for effective Border Management_

_(i) Fencing of Indo-Bangladesh border:_

  The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was 344.41 Km out of which about 70% work have been completed.

 According to Mizoram State Boundary Committee, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram are now within Bangladesh side of the border due to irresponsibility of the construction companies who are fencing the Mizoram- Bangladesh border. The Boundary Committee also found that the fences pass through the middle of 20 other villages.

 Border fencing work could not be undertaken along a 60-km stretch in the Dampa Tiger Reserve owing to pending clearances from the National Board of Wildlife, which has demanded that the State transfer of around 1,520 hectares of non-forestland in compensation.

_(ii) Border Flood Lights:_

 The progress of floodlighting work as on 31.12.2015 along Mizoram-Bangladesh border is as follows:

 Completed : 335.66 kms.

 Sanctioned : 51.11kms.

_(iii) Border Roads:_

****Along Mizoram-Bangladesh Border, a stretch of 303.97 km. length of border patrol-roads has also been constructed out of the sanctioned length of about 602. 28 km.

****Out of the total of 91 Border Out-Posts (BOPs) approved , the construction in respect of 18 BOPs has been completed and the work in other 73 BOPs are yet to be established along Mizoram-Bangladesh Borders.

 Mizoram Police had separately deployed security personnel (IR Bn) along Indo-Bangladesh border particularly on the western side of Mamit District, Mizoram.

_(v) Special Task Force(STF) :_

In order to detect and deport settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram , 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.
