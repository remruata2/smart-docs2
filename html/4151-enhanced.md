****Subject: Threat Assessment Report for Shri Biswajit Deb, Advocate General of Mizoram****

**Sir,**

****I am writing to inform you that a comprehensive threat perception and assessment have been conducted for Shri Biswajit Deb, the Advocate General of Mizoram. This detailed report is based on information gathered through field inquiries, personal interactions, and observations at key locations, including his office chamber at MINECO.****

****The report outlines the threats he faces, the financial implications of his ongoing legal cases, and his crucial role in safeguarding the interests of the Government of Mizoram. The findings and analysis are detailed below:****

**A. ROLE AND SENSITIVE CASES**

**Shri Biswajit Deb, as the Advocate General, is handling several highly sensitive legal cases that have significant financial implications for the Government of Mizoram:**

**1. Ballygunge Mizoram House Land Appeal**

**This ongoing case in the Kolkata High Court involves substantial financial stakes, estimated at â‚¹150-200 crores. A stay order by the Division Bench has halted potential land transactions, causing financial setbacks for various stakeholders. The opposing parties include influential figures, with some allegedly connected to criminal networks, adding complexity to the case.**

**2. Tuirial Hydel Project Land Compensation**

****This case involves claims by 700 individuals for forest land compensation totaling â‚¹100 crores. It is being argued before a Division Bench in Aizawl, as directed by the Supreme Court, and requires intensive scrutiny to safeguard state interests.****

****Mr. Deb has adopted a firm stance against these claims, stressing the importance of protecting state resources from exaggerated or unsubstantiated compensation demands.****

**3. Challenge to the 2016 Land Acquisition Act**

****This case centers on disputes over the implementation of the 2016 Land Acquisition Act, which the Single Bench of the Gauhati High Court invalidated, impacting land compensation processes. An appeal filed in the Supreme Court by the Advocate General’s office carries significant financial ramifications, necessitating Mr. Deb's expertise and steadfast dedication to the state's legal defense.****

**The Advocate General’s contribution to these cases is both critical and essential, as he defends the Government of Mizoram against potentially severe financial losses.**

**B. THREAT PERCEPTION AND INCIDENTS**

**1. Threats in Kolkata and Other States**

**i) Nature of Threats: Mr. Deb has reported facing several direct and indirect threats, particularly in relation to the Ballygunge Mizoram House Land Appeal.**

**ii) High-Profile Threat Sources:**

**Influential figures, including notable real estate investors and individuals with political connections, have put pressure on him to withdraw or lessen his stance in court.**

**Some prominent individuals, such as retired bureaucrats and politicians with vested interests, have allegedly cautioned him against pursuing these cases aggressively.**

**iii) Links to Organized Crime:**

**Numerous stakeholders are reportedly connected to criminal syndicates, underground organizations, organized groups, and mafia networks, significantly increasing the risk to Mr. Deb’s safety.**

**Financial Stakes**

**The financial stakes involved in these cases are significant, with â‚¹150-200 crores tied up in the Ballygunge case and â‚¹100 crores in the Tuirial Hydel Project. Such large amounts create an unstable environment where adverse outcomes for the involved parties could lead to serious repercussions.**

**Incidents in Kolkata**

**Shri Deb reported receiving phone calls and messages warning him to cease representing the Government of Mizoram in these high-stakes cases. On one occasion, anonymous callers threatened severe consequences if he continued to argue the Ballygunge Mizoram House case.**

**Incidents in Aizawl**

**On November 11, 2024, while staying at the Royale Lalawi Hotel, Shri Deb received two suspicious calls on the hotel's landline. Investigations later revealed these calls were intercom-based and internal, questioning their legitimacy as external threats and reducing the credibility of the threat.**

**Mr. Deb expressed confidence in the existing Personal Security Officer (PSO) arrangement within Mizoram and formally requested the withdrawal of residential guards in Aizawl.**

**Threats in Kolkata and Other States**

**The financial stakes in the Ballygunge case make Shri Deb a target for those with vested interests. The interconnectedness of influential individuals and organized crime heightens the risk.**

**The ongoing legal proceedings in other significant cases, such as the Tuirial Hydel Project, intensify these threats. Adverse judgments could have severe financial implications for claimants. The persistent threats from high-profile individuals leveraging political and criminal networks necessitate strong protective measures.**

**Threats in Mizoram**

**The threat level within Mizoram is minimal, as indicated by Mr. Deb’s contentment with the current security arrangement, which includes only one Personal Security Officer (PSO).**

**Recommendations**

**1. Security in Mizoram: As per Govt. of Mizoram, Home Department Notification No.D.32019/15/2018-HMS dt.08.01.2024, Advocate General, Mizoram was given “X” category of Protected Person. In the meantime, according to the Mizoram Notification No.A.45012/3/2021-LJE dated 01.02.2024 from the Law and Judicial Department, Mr. Deb enjoys the rank of a Cabinet Minister under the Government of Mizoram. Therefore, his current X-category security setup may be upgraded to Y- category which is also given to Cabinet Minister in Mizoram.**

****2. Inter-State Coordination: Collaborate with the governments of West Bengal, Assam, and other relevant states to synchronize security measures and ensure uninterrupted protection during Mr. Deb’s interstate travels.****

**3. Incident Reporting: The Government of Mizoram should maintain vigilance in monitoring the financial interests in these cases to prevent undue pressure or manipulation from vested interests.**

**Conclusion:**

****Advocate General Shri Biswajit Deb plays a crucial role in defending the Government of Mizoram's interests in cases with significant financial stakes. The ongoing threats he faces in Kolkata and other states require enhanced security measures to ensure his safety and operational efficiency. So, it is recommended that Govt. of West Bengal may be approached to review his categorization based on this threat assessment report for his assignments within West Bengal.****

**Within Mizoram, one (01) house guard was already given to Shri Biswajit Deb, Advocate General, Mizoram in line with his security category of “Y” in West Bengal on 09.12.2024 at Royale Lalawi Hotel, Khatla. In view of the aforesaid threats and the status of Shri Biswajit Deb, Advocate General, Mizoram granted by Govt. of Mizoram, it is suggested to upgrade his Security categorization from “X” category to “Y” category.**
