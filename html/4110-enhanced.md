**2 (b). Transportation/smuggling of cattle from Barak valley to further smuggling to Bangladesh :**

 The habitants of Mizoram are predominantly Christians and as such, the major populations are not subjected to much restrictions from social and religious grounds as far as consumption of any kind of meat products. However, most of the slaughter houses are fed by cattles domesticated locally or from the eastern side of the state. Cattles from Barak Valley are hardly transported into the state for their meat let alone transported or smuggled through the state into Bangladesh.

**2(d). Conflict between Myanmar Army and PDF (People's Defence Forces);its impact in Mizoram :**

1) Issue of refugees:

 The military coup of 1st February 2021 in Myanmar and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) resulted in the influxes of considerable number of Myanmar nationals in general and Chin community in particular seeking asylum and taking shelter in Mizoram. However, not all these refugees continued staying in Mizoram as some of them had returned to their home country, Myanmar. In one incident which occurred on 12.11.2023, the forces of Chin National Army (CNA) and their allies launched an attack on military camps located at Rihkhawdar village and Khawmawi village,Myanmar on the Indo (Mizoram) Myanmar border. As a result of the gun battle, a stray bullet killed one Chawngthianmawia (35) of Myanmar, who had seek refuge at Zokhawthar (Mizoram).

The number of Myanmarese nationals taking refuge in Mizoram are as follows : (as on 22.01.2024)

 As a result of the escalating resistance put up against the military regime of Myanmar by Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) from 2021, the number of injured/wounded People's Defence Force (PDF)/ Chinland Defence Force (CDF) personnel seeking medical treatment in Mizoram state have crossed more than 100 persons. The some serious injured volunteers even approached better medical treatment in elsewhere cities such as Guwahati and Delhi.

 Recently, one of the main base camp of Myanmar Army located at Taingan was overrun by People's Defence Force (PDF) wherein they reportedly killed 20 Myanmar Army personnel. Seven (7) volunteers of PDF, who were wounded as a result of this encounter are intended to be brought to Aizawl, Mizoram for medical treatment on 23rd January 2024.

 Information received further indicated that the PDF is planning to attack the military camp located at Tidim, Myanmar, after they had overrun the military camp of Taingan. In this connection, they had also informed civilians living around the Tidim military camp to evacuate to other places for their safety.

2) Issue of Uniform Personnel of Myanmar surrendering to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles:

 Due to the recent intense military operations conducted by the combined resistance forces of Myanmar against Myanmar Army in several places of Chin State, Myanmar, many Myanmar Army and Police personnel posted and camped near the IMB surrendered themselves to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles at different places. These personnel of Myanmar were evacuated to safety for their return into Myanmar. The lack of proper Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on the issue of surrendering of Myanmar Army personnel or government servant needed a review to devise a strategy on the matter.

 The issue of foreign National Army entering our state/country with arms and ammunitions in large numbers is a threat to the internal security of the state as well as the country. The entry of such unauthorised entry of armed foreign Army personnel post a high risk to the population especially the residents along the indo (Mizoram) Myanmar border areas.

Uniform personnel of Myanmar who surrendered to Mizoram Police/Assam Rifles are as under :
