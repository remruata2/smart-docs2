 Information has been received that today, i.e. 4.7.2019, Forest Department officials of Assam (around 10 in number) headed by a Forest Range Officer has started renovation work of one building located at the disputed Mizoram-Assam Forest Reserve area along the Aizawl-Silchar National Highway. It was reported that the building used to be utilized as Cinema Hall/Movie Theatre some 20 years back and has been lying unoccupied since then. It is learnt that the building is being renovated for housing of Assam Forest Border Post.

 On having learnt the news, around 20 (twenty) Mizos and 80 (eighty) residents of Lailapur, Assam gathered at the spot. However, no untoward incident occurred. Mizoram Police under the command of Addl. SP, Kolasib and SDO(C), Vairengte also immediately rushed to the spot. They informed the Assam Forest staff engaging in the work to cease their activity as the area falls under disputed Forest Reserve area. However, the workers refused to comply stating that they are acting according to the instruction of Divisional Forest Officer, Cachar.

 Both the DC and the SP, Kolasib have also proceeded to Vairengte. A meeting was held at SDO(C) Office, Vairengte in which District authorities and NGOs of Vairengte held a discussion on possible Law &amp; Order situation and its prevention. Thereafter, SP, Kolasib held a meeting with DFO, Cachar at Lailapur today @ 6:30 p.m. After thorough discussion, the meeting resolved to stop the ongoing renovation work for the time being.

 Unconfirmed report has indicated that radical and disgruntled elements of Vairengte may resort to some kind of criminal activities to sabotage the stated renovation work.

 In this regard, it is suggested that DC, Kolasib may immediately liaise with his counterpart to work out lasting solution.

 It may be recalled that a meeting between District Administration of Kolasib, Mizoram and Cachar, Assam held on 3.9.2015 @ 11:00 a.m at CIJWS Conference Hall, Vairengte resolved issue regarding Forest Reserve area, quoted:
