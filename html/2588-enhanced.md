Subj:  WP(C) No. 924/2017 (Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay-vrs-Union  of India &amp; Ors) - reg.

Ref : No. LB/PHQ/959/2021 Dated 01.11.2021.

Sir,

 With reference to the subject and letter No. cited above, I am to state that Writ Petition (Civil) no.924/2017 submitted by Aswhini Kumar Upadhyay was carefully perused point by point. The petitioner in his 56 (fifty six) points stressed the adverse impact of large scale illegal immigrants particularly from Myanmar and Bangladesh to the demographic structure of bordering states and impairing the security and national integration. It also mentioned the Law Commission 175th Report (21.09.2000) on the Foreigners (Amendment) Bill and the Report of the Governor of Assam Dated 08.11.1998. The petitioner also stated that huge numbers of illegal immigrants have occupied vast tracts of land particularly at sensitive international border and believed that this is due to ethnic proximity and kinship enabling easy shelter to the immigrants, porous and easily negotiable border, better economic opportunities and interested religious and political elements. The petitioner further stated that if present Union Government is not determined enough to end the menace of such illegal immigrants or infiltrators immediately, it will shape a major social - economic crisis in the near future. Therefore, not only 40,000 illegal Rohingyas infiltrators, the Union and State Governments must detain and deport all the infiltrators from India without further delay. It may be noteworthy to mention here that since the petitioner merely stated the history and problems of illegal immigrants particularly from Myanmar and Bangladesh, it is felt that there is nothing to comment from the purview of this unit.

 It may be added here that the petitioner prayed to the Hon’ble Supreme Court to issue a Writ Order or direction to direct the Central and State Governments to identify, detain and deport all the illegal immigrants and infiltrators, to amend the respective laws to make illegal migration and infiltration as a cognizable, non-bailable and non-compoundable offence, and to declare making of forged/ fabricated PAN Cards, Aadhar Cards etc. and such other documents as a non-bailable, non-compoundable and cognizable offence and to amend the respective laws accordingly etc. Hence, Supreme Court issue a notice to the Union of India and to all the State Governments in India as to why _rule nisi_in terms of the prayer as contained in the Writ Petition should not be issued.

 It is therefore, felt that the above mentioned petition submitted by Aswhini Kumar Upadhyay is purely legal matters and giving legal opinion/comment is not the purview of this unit. However, it may be noted that the state law enforcement agency and border guarding forces (i.e., Assam Rifles and Border Security Force) faced various challenges in dealing with illegal immigrants and cross border crimes, and the above mentioned offences in the petition such as making of forged/ fabricated PAN Cards, Aadhar Cards etc. and illegal migration and infiltration are already non-bailable, non-compoundable and cognizable offence under the relevant sections of IPC, The Foreigner Act, 1946 and The Passport (Entry Into India) Act, 1920.

Yours faithfully,
