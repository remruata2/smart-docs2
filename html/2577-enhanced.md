 _SECURITY THREAT PERCEPTION ASSESSMENT REPORT_

 During his term as Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lunglei from 2006 to 2011,Pu F.Rohlupuia, MJS and the present Addl. District &amp; Session Judge, Lunglei had presided over various sensitive Court cases such as case of eviction by members of YMA, dismantling of house etc. In one particular case where a house was dismantled under his Court Order, the owner of the said house even threatened him with dire consequences which had compelled him ( Pu F.Rohlupuia) to apply for an arm license.

 Further, due to his present position as a Judge, Special Court under ND&amp;PS Act,1985, he handles cases involving hardened criminals having wide network with money where the penalties are often hard and severe if convicted.

 Considering the nature of his job and to enable him to discharge his responsibilities free and fairly with confidence, it may be suggested to provide him with a suitable PSO.
