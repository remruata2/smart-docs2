****BRU REFUGEES****

**I.**  **GENESIS**

****The BNU conference held in September, 1997 at Saipuilui village in Mamit District adopted a resolution for creation of Autonomous District Council for Brus in the western part of Mizoram which was strongly objected by the Mizo community in the concerned area. At the same time a militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) which was formed in 1996 under the leadership of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became more and more active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news about the killing had spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by BNU. Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram at the instance of the BNLF for their operational convenience.

 The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government.

  The Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF) who took arms against the state of Mizoram since 1996 laid down their arms to the Govt. of Mizoram on 25th July, 2005 after 13(thirteen) rounds of Peace Talks between Govt. of Mizoram and BNLF. As many as 195 BNLF surrendered. The other Bru militant outfit called Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram(BLFM) formed in the year 2000 after they break away from parent outfit BNLF, took arms against Mizoram till they surrendered to the Govt. of Mizoram on 26th October, 2006. As many as 804 BLFM cadres surrendered and were given same package as a rehabilitation plan with their parent body BNLF.
