**Ransom decreases to 50 lakhs****:**Kidnappers of 5 workers of Dampa Tiger Reserve of Forest Dept. decreases the ransom money that they demanded from 1 crore to 50 lakhs.

 On Thursday, kidnappers informed Forest Dept. that they demand 1 crore for ransom but one who called himself as commander made a call to the family one of the hostages yesterday at around 10:00AM saying that they demand 50 lakhs for ransom. They also informed them that 3 days are left to fulfill their demand and that they do not want army/police involvement in the issue and they want a Pastor to hand down the ransom.

 The police keep on tracking for the kidnappers who are believed to be NLFT-an insurgent group of Tripura. It is also believed that some Brus helped them. Many people strongly believed Dobe Reang (who was involved in the burglary of Zawlnuam BDO office last year) is also involved in this kidnap case.

 As the ransom decreases to half of their previous demand, many people believed that Bru are involved.
