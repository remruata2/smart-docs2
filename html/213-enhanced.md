****THREAT PERCEPTION IN RESPECT OF ACCOUNTANT GENERAL (AG), MIZORAM AND DIRECTOR, NIT MIZORAM****

 _ACCOUNTANT GENERAL (AG) :_ With regard to the impasse between the Accountant General (AG), Mizoram and the Graduate Trainees (Contractual employees) whose tenure had ended in August 2018, discreet enquiry was conducted to ascertain whether the stalemate could invite any law &amp; order situation in the near future.

 It is learnt that the layoff Graduate Trainees (30 members) have decided to resort to their cause through legal means/their counsel. Besides, the erstwhile Accountant General (AG) Mr. Pravendra Yadav, IA&amp;AS had been transferred to Tripura in the aftermath of the situation.

 Taking in to account the views and sentiments of the General Trainees (GA) and their proposed course of action, it is unlikely that the stalemate would invite any law &amp; order situation in the near future.

_DIRECTOR, NIT MIZORAM_: With regard to the impending issues between Mizo Students Union (MSU) and Director, NIT Mizoram, enquiry was conducted to ascertain the course of action of MSU as well as the threat perception thereon.

The election for the Office Bearers of the MSU General Headquarters was recently conducted on 31.10.2018. The newly elected leaders hardly had sit more than once for a meeting since then. The Executive committee recently constituted had not convened any meeting. The Secretaries are yet to be appointed too.

Further, leaders of the MSU are approached so as to ascertain their schedule and issues to be pursued in the near future. It is learnt that MSU General Headquarters had no intention to raise any issue against Director, NIT Mizoram ahead of the Mizoram General Election 2018.

Hence, it is concluded that the threat perception in respect of Accountant General (AG), Mizoram and Director, NIT Mizoram is minimal at the moment.
