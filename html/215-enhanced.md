****VERIFICATION REPORT OF STP IN THE RESIDENCE OF PU PC LALTHANLIANA, CABINET MINISTER & PU C.NGUNLIANCHUNGA, MINISTER OF STATE****

  At present, one Asst. Sub-Inspector, one Havilder and 3+3 Constables are deployed for each of the said official for their House Guard duty. Even if the Commandant of 225 Bn. CRPF reason is true, it is not convenient to release the house guards unless Mizoram Police Department can provide replacement from its own department.

**Direct threat or intimidation may not exist for the said officials for the time being but since Election had already been announced by the ECI for Mizoram state, provision of better security for the said officials or strengthening their security is obligatory for the state government. And also that if the house guards of Pu****PC Lalthanliana, Cabinet Minister &amp; Pu C.Ngunlianchunga, Minister of State are released from their duty while no other house guards of other VIPs/Officials are released/withdrawn, the officials may not be pleased with the decision and might feel neglected.**

 

** Considering the above mentioned points, it is concluded that CRPF house guards may not be released from the residence of Pu****PC Lalthanliana, Cabinet Minister &amp; Pu C.Ngunlianchunga, Minister of State. **
