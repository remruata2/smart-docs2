Subject: Assessment of threat perception.

Ref: NO. SEC/R-40/2016/61 dt.26.11.2018.

Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject mentioned above, discreet assessment of threat perception in respect of Shri Mohan Chakma, Executive Member, Chakma Autonomous District Council was conducted.

 During the course of enquiry, it was ascertained that Shri Mohan Chakma had indeed received threatening call through mobile phone on the night of 9.11.2018. Moreover, on 24.11.2018, the back glass of his motor vehicle, while he was on election campaign, was shot using a gun suspected to be a .22 calibre pistol by an unknown person. Accordingly, a criminal case vide Vasei PS C/No. 10/18 dt.18.11.2018 u/s 307/506 IPC r/w 27 Arms Act has been registered and duly investigated to.

 However, as of now, no imminent threat is perceived against the said Executive Member. Furthermore, as the Assembly Election process had already been concluded, provision of PSO may not be necessary at the moment.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
