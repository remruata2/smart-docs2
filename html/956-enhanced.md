****Point No. 3 Smuggling of Narcotics Detail****

 Mizoram has a long international boundary of 404 kms with Myanmar and Mizoram lies at the periphery of the Golden Triangle, historically known for drug manufacturing and trade. India and Myanmar has a bilateral agreement known as Free Movement Regime (FMR) which allows free movement of Indian and Myanmarese nationals within 16 kms of the border without visa restrictions. This creates favourable conditions for economic and financial interaction making Mizoram a destination for both legal and illegal goods. A dangerous dimension is also noticed in the symbiotic relationship existing between insurgency and narcotic trade which proliferates the existence of drug trafficking.

 The narcotic drug such as Heroin, Opium, Ganja, etc, known/seized in Mizoram are mostly transported from Myanmar and the main route for transportation of narcotic drug by the smugglers are from the different crossing points of the Tiau River separating Mizoram and Myanmar mainly from Khawmawi in Myanmar and Zokhawthar on the Mizoram side.

In recent years there has been an alarming trend of smuggling of Pseudoephedrine from mainland India through Mizoram into Myanmar. The smuggled Pseudoephedrine is used for preparation of Methamphetamine in jungle labs in Myanmar. The finished products i.e. Methamphetamine tablets are then smuggled back into Mizoram from Myanmar for local consumption or further distribution in other places.

Meanwhile, almost all Cannabis (Marijuana) seized by Drug Law Enforcement Agencies in Mizoram have entered via Manipur and Myanmar. Heroin is packed using transparent polythene and further kept in Plastic soap cases of identical make of various colours. Whereas original packets originated from the Golden Triangle are known to be of larger quantity usually of 1 kg or half kg bearing certain trademarks or brand names such as Double Globe, Double Lion etc. Based on interrogation of accused persons, it is strongly suspected that such original (larger packets) are re-packaged into smaller packets weighing approximately 14-15 grams and kept in plastic soap cases by some organized gangs either in Tahan/Kaletwa or Mandalay and are then trafficked into Mizoram.

**Strategies for combating Trafficking of Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances in Mizoram:**

1. **Setting up of Special Narcotic Cell at Champhai:**

On 30.8.1995, the Home Department, Government of Mizoram declared the erstwhile Special Narcotic Cell under SP CID(Crime) as Special Narcotic Police Station and it has a vast territorial jurisdiction. Special Narcotic Police Station is the only empowered Police Station which deals exclusively with Narcotic related cases for 5(five) districts of Mizoram viz. Aizawl, Kolasib, Champhai, Mamit and Serchhip. The total strength of Special Narcotics PS as on 29.8.2019 is Inspr. 1 no., SI 2 nos., ASI 3 nos., Head Constable 2 nos., Constable 8 nos., Driver 1 no., IV Grade 1 no., (Total 19) which is highly insufficient to deal with Narcotic related cases of Aizawl city alone, not to speak of the above noted districts.

Champhai is very well connected to cities in Myanmar that include Tiddim and Mandalay and is just 28 kms from Indo-Myanmar border. It is the main business corridor for India and Myanmar since decades for legal and illegal transaction. The opening of a Special Narcotic Cell at Champhai is highly recommended for early intervention and checking of illegal entry of drugs into Mizoram. With Special Narcotic Cell at Champhai, it is expected to act as a hindrance and deter the drug smugglers. It would confront the smugglers at their main entry route which is expected to mitigate the menace of drug trafficking into Mizoram which subsequently will also become a barrier for distribution to other destinations.

In view of the above, Special Narcotic Cell was established at Champhai vide No.CB/PHQ/B/9/2019 dated 1.10.2019. It is to be manned from the existing strength of Champhai DEF under the overall supervision of SDPO, Champhai.

1. **To establish new Narcotic cell at Serchhip and Khawzawl:**

It is also proposed to establish Narcotic cell at Serchhip and Khawzawl from their own existing strength headed by their respective SDPOs as both the districts are located on the two main routes of drugs.

1. **Engagement of Special Police Officer:**

Special Police Officers (SPO) may be engaged at three or four selected villages located at Indo-Myanmar border within Champhai District. Such SPOs will be selected from the local villagers who will assist police in gathering intelligence so as to enhance seizure of drugs. Approval of the Govt. is to be sought for funding.

1. **Formation of ND&PS Act Acquittal Committee:**

A Committee comprising of Police Officials and Public Prosecutors under the Chairmanship of DIG CID be formed to discuss acquittal cases relating to ND&amp;PS Act. The Committee will discuss the reason of acquittal, to identify lapses in the investigation of ND&amp;PS cases, conduct training on investigation on ND&amp;PS Act cases in liaise with DIG Training, Excise and Narcotics Department and Public Prosecutors. The target for such trainings may include Police Officials of Special Narcotic Police Station, Police Stations and Out Posts dealing with ND&amp;PS cases. The Committee will have a quarterly meeting and SP, CID (Crime) will review and monitor bail applications by the accused persons/ suspects, progress of trials and ensure effective prosecution including the appointment of Special Public Prosecutors of suitable standing.

1. **Awareness campaign:**

Demand reduction and awareness campaigns have to be conducted vigorously at Unit level, Police station level as well as in Schools and other educational institutions. Funds for conducting public awareness including preparation of documentary film/clip are essential and it may be prepared in collaboration with Social Welfare Department and Excise and Narcotics Department.

**Better co-ordination with stakeholders:**

Maintaining mutual co-ordination among stakeholders and sister agencies viz. Assam Rifles, BSF, CRPF, SIB may result in curbing this menace. Conducting joint operation and sharing of credible and timely information will act as deterrence to drug smugglers.

1. **Maintaining of accurate and reliable data bank:**

Data of seizure of drug for the last 15 years, consisting of particulars of the arrested persons,modus operandi, year wise conviction/acquittal percentage and reason of acquittal has been sent to all SP within Mizoram,their compliance report is being awaited. The data is expected to be helpful for early detection of criminals, to understand the methods and technique of traffickers and for giving enhanced punishment of the accused persons and for keeping them under surveillance.

1. **Monetary assistance from NCB:**

**Considerable expenditures are required to embark upon sustained operations against drug traffickers which are often beyond the budgetary means of the State Police. Proposal be made for re-imbursement of these expenditures by NCB in the line of SRE to be made available to the frontline state like Mizoram. At present, this is beyond the existing “**Guidelines to States for Availing Assistance**”, but is howeveressential to sustain the war against narcotics which is vital for the interests of not only Mizoram but the country at large.**
