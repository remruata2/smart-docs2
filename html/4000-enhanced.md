**FMR New Guidelines (Free Movement Limit On Indo-Myanmar Border Tightened To 10 Km, With Border Pass)**_:_

The Indian government has implemented new measures to regulate movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following a directive from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). On 24thDecember 2024, the MHA announced a new protocol that reduced the free movement regime (FMR) range from 16 km to 10 km. Although Union Home Minister Amit Shah had previously announced in February last year that the FMR would be scrapped, an official notification has yet to be issued.

Security along the 510-km border has been strengthened, and residents living within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border are now required to obtain a Border Pass for travel. The border pass, which allows a stay of up to seven days, is being issued to both Indian and Myanmar citizens who can provide documentation verifying their residence within the 10-km zone. This new rule, effective from December 31, is being enforced by State Police, Assam Rifles, and Health Officials at key entry and exit points. The crossing points is operational from Monday to Saturday, between 6:00 am to 3:30 pm.

  This new guidelines came into practical w.e.f. 1st Jan. 2025 at Zokhawthar and Hnahlan, Champhai District, Mizoram-Myanmar border and till 29.01.2025, the number of person entered from Myanmar to India is 1745 and India to Myanmar is 34 at Zokhawthar, person entered from Myanmar to India is 22 and India to Myanmar is 16 at Hnahlan. The Zokhawthar and Hnahlan is pilot site for new entry and Exit point.

**Drugs seizures****:**

The modus operandi and ways of concealment of smuggled narcotics used by smugglers is constantly evolving. The past seizures of narcotics in the state revealed that these drugs are often concealed in sealed food packages, vegetables, electrical goods and more commonly inside a car door panel or costumed concealed compartment inside a vehicle.

Further, the emerging trend of using end to end encrypted messaging applications and compartmentalizing activities like logistics, finances or intelligence gathering by different groups or units complicated the interception of modern narcotics syndicates.

During this month till 29.01.2025, most of the drugs seized i.e. 80 % (approx.) are destined to Assam and other outerstate whereas 20 % (approx.) are destined for local consumption which are mostly transported from Myanmar.
