 Govt. of Mizoram

Ref: Home Deptt. letter No. J.15011/10/2010-HM.

Subject: Newspaper Clipping in connection with Press Release issued by Bru   Displaced Welfare Organisation(BDWO).

Sir,

 With reference to the above cited subject and letter no. referred, I am to state that the recently formed Bru Displaced Welfare Organisation(BDWO) issued a Press Release on 13.10.2010, a gist of which was reflected in our special report on 13.10.2010 in which they indicated their strong objection to the Bru Refugee Repatriation Process being undertaken by Govt. of Mizoram and strongly attacking the initiative taken by MBDPF President Elvis Chorkhy in this regard. The Press Release mainly demanded the repatriation process should not be allowed to go ahead unless memorandum of understanding is signed between Govt. of Mizoram and leaders of BDWO and various points raised by them included four corner talk, one year free ration, ` 1 lakh as compensation for each family, restoration of their respective plot of land and resettling the Bru refugees inside Mamit District only.

 The BDWO Press Release also warned that unless their demand is considered by the Government, they could not rule out organising agitational programme including road blockade and demonstration at Aizawl and New Delhi etc. The newspaper clipping in question as seen in the Aizawl Post Daily issued on 14.10.2010 was a reflection of this Press Release.

 It may be mentioned here that the Press Release issued by the so-called BDWO originated from some section of MBDPF leaders who are continually opposing the repatriation of Bru refugees from Tripura to Mizoram and it is to be kept in mind that whenever Government takes some action for Bru repatriation they are in the habit of raising their voices to the press by issuing Press Release or submitting memorandum to the concerned authorities.

 A fax copy of the said Press Release is enclosed herewith for ready reference please.

Yours faithfully,

**(C. LALDINA)**
