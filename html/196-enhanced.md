To,

 The Deputy Inspector General of Police (Hqrs)

  Mizoram, Aizawl

Subject: Assessment of threat perception.

Ref:  No.PHQ/AB/9/DEPLOYMENT/281 Dt. 1.4.2016.

Sir,

 Apropos the above, I am sending herewith the assessment and situation report regarding ISPW Station, Aizawl for your kind information and necessary action.

1. ISPW Aizawl Station is one of the 32 ISPW Stations spread across the country under the Directorate of co-ordination(Police Wireless), Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India. All Inter-State Police communications besides the Directorate of the co-ordination(Police Wireless) are made through ISPW.

2. Construction of ISPW Aizawl Station building at New Secretariat Complex was completed by the year 2014. The site was somehow secluded and the Station Superintendent had insisted round the clock security personnel assistance to enable him to occupy the new office building as is the case in all the other ISPW Stations across the country.

3. The PHQ Aizawl had also earlier asked Directorate of Co-ordination Police Wireless, MHA for provision of basic amenities like accommodation, guard room, duty post, kitchen, water connection, electricity etc. The Station Superintendent had intimated that all these requirement have been in readiness.

 Despite its role as the sole Inter-State Police communication agency including sensitive informations, the threat perceived by the station as well as its staffs is minimal be it from insurgent groups, NGOs', criminals, anti-social elements etc.

 This is for your information and necessary action please.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
