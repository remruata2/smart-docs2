Mr. V Malsawmdawngliana is a reputed businessman who runs the Modicare Service centre, located at Zarkawt near KFC, as well as being Dalmia Cement Dealer and distributor of Nokia phones. The Modicare service centre is the main office of Modicare in Aizawl where new products are introduced and conference are held for the various consultants of Modicare. He being an experience businessman was introduced to Modicare by his friend from Nagaland who is also a Nokia distributor there in 2012. Since then he has been running the Modicare service centre as well as the warehouse for stocking all the products of Modicare at their office at Zarkawt. But from 2018 the volume of Modicare products expanded rapidly due to the massive increase in demand for the company's product in Mizoram and it became difficult to adequate both the service centre and the warehouse in one location, so the company decided it was necessary to find another partner to be in charge of stocking product and running a warehouse in Aizawl.

Therefore, in 2018, the company made an agreement with TVS Logistics, which is a third party logistics company to locate a suitable warehouse and to hire a necessary manpower and take up stocking of products and from June 2019, Mr. V Malsawmdawngliana was relieved of the responsibility of stocking the product. He now runs the Modicare service centre alone at his store at Zarkawt.
