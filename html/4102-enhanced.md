****NOTES ON LIA MEETING FOR 30.09.2024****

**I**. **Security scenario in Mizoram**:

  Security scenario in Mizoram is mostly peaceful. However, with the increase of influx of refugees into Mizoram due to the political condition in the neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh, some commercial activities are being exploited/used by these refugees to earn their living which is not welcome by the local residents of Mizoram. Morever, the refugees have started involving in criminal cases within Mizoram. Recently, on Dt.23.09.2024, one Arakan Myanmar refugee who was employed in a shop had stolen a huge amount of cash amounting to Rs.10 lakhs with one scooty from his employer at Lawngtlai Chanmari Veng and he was later arrested and a criminal case had been registered against him.

  Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and reorganise themselves. They have been indulging in collection of donation and extortion from the closing months of 2022. In this regard, 27 criminal cases have been registered in Mizoram against the cadres of Lalhmingthanga Sanate (HPCD) faction till date out of which 8 cases have been Chargesheeted and 7 HPC(D) cadres arrested.

**II.****Trans-border activities and movement (BD side):** 

  Recently, on 19.09.2024, a violent clash erupted between the Bengalis and the ethnic communities of Chakma and Marma in the sensitive Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) resulting in the loss of lives of the Chakma communities. As violence unfolded, many indigenous residents of Chakma and Marma communities sought refuge in the forests as their houses and shops were burnt to ashes by the illegal plain settlers. Due to this incident, there is a high possibility that the minority community may seek refuge inside the Indian Territory in the near future.
