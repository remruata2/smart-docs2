**FOREIGNERS IDENTIFICATION PORTAL (FIP):**

The Foreigners Identification Portal (FIP) is designed for recording the personal and biometric information of foreign nationals residing illegally. Currently, access to FIP is limited to the District Deputy Commissioner in Mizoram, as the Police Department does not yet have access.

In a Council of Ministers meeting held on September 27, 2023, at 10:30 AM in the Chief Minister's Office Cabinet Room, the issue of documenting the biographic and biometric data of illegal migrants in Mizoram was addressed. It was concluded that, given the impending General Elections to the Mizoram State Assembly, the Government of Mizoram should not undertake the collection of such data. Therefore, the identification of foreigners residing illegally is not feasible at that time.

Consequently, the Commissioner &amp; Secretary to the Mizoram Government's Home Department was asked to guide the Police Department on using the Foreigners Identification Portal through letter No. MSB/VB-56/2024/4 dated March 18, 2024. A reply from the relevant authority is still awaited.

The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Foreigners Identification Portal, under the Foreigners Division, MHA, currently utilized by the Government of Mizoram, was created by NIC, MHA on February 2, 2024.

1. The FIP comprises six fields: Application Details (Mandatory) Address Details in Origin Country (Mandatory) Address Details in India (Mandatory) Identity Details (Mandatory) Occupation in Origin Country Occupation in India
2. Application Details (Mandatory)
3. Address Details in Origin Country (Mandatory)
4. Address Details in India (Mandatory)
5. Identity Details (Mandatory)
6. Occupation in Origin Country

1. Application Details (Mandatory)
2. Address Details in Origin Country (Mandatory)
3. Address Details in India (Mandatory)
4. Identity Details (Mandatory)
5. Occupation in Origin Country
6. Occupation in India

1. The State Government has no objections and the foreigners have no issues regarding the application details.

1. Foreigners, particularly displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh, do not possess e-mail IDs, which are mandatory for the Address Detail field.

1. In the mandatory Address Details in India section, State Government officials and displaced individuals from Myanmar and Bangladesh are unable to specify their Entry Dates into India accurately. These individuals often enter through multiple points and frequently travel back and forth due to circumstances in their home countries. Additionally, they cannot determine the required Area Code, which is also mandatory.

1. The section on the Agency or Individual responsible for sending individuals to India is irrelevant for displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh.

1. Regarding the mandatory Identity Details, displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh lack the necessary documents for uploading to the Portal. Additionally, there is difficulty in uploading the Myanmar embassy form, as the State Government does not have access to it.

1. There are no issues with the Occupation in Origin Country and Occupation in India fields, as these are not mandatory.

1. Due to strong ancestral ties with displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh, and considering the unstable political situations in Myanmar and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the State Government believes that deporting or pushing back these refugees should not be pursued until their safety and security can be assured. Consequently, the State Government suggests that the relevance of the Embassy Form be reconsidered by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

**Notes:**

1. The Embassy Form is to be reviewed by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). It will be communicated with the embassies of the concerned countries in India to confirm the nationality of the illegal migrants/displaced persons, facilitating the issuance of necessary travel documents for their immediate deportation.

2. Regarding the capture of biometric details of displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh under the NAFIS Portal, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) finalized necessary revisions to the portal to accommodate the specific needs of these displaced individuals on May 3, 2024.
