<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Without proper investigation and justification of the incident while referring to the security forces, police and administration, it was one-sidedly said in the news that 3 PCJSS armed workers, in words of some media, &lsquo;terrorists&rsquo; were killed in a gun fight between the two armed groups of PCJSS in Balumura Marma Para of Gaindya Union under Rajasthali Upazila of Rangamati Hill District. In fact and in reality, the rendered news is a flatly false, concocted, twisted and of politically motivated.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">It has been learnt that on 18 November 2019, an armed group, an offshoot of Arakan Liberation Party (ALP) backed by the local Awami League leadership and the army, entered the No. 8 Noapara village of Ward No. 5 of Rajvilla Union under Bandarban Sadar Upazila of Bandarban Hill district in a heavy state of drunkenness. On entering the village, they begun to catch the youths and males and beat them. At last, they forcibly took 4 persons including Monaram Tanchangya (55), Karbari (village head) of Noapara village, and his son Sukhamoni Tanchangya (Shukramoni) (32) away at the gun point at 4:00 pm. Though they released one of them, in the evening time, they brutally killed in firing all the other 3 persons including Monaram Tanchangya and Sukhamoni Tanchangya at Balumura area, a border spot of Gaindya Union and Rajvila Union. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">It is worthy to be mentioned that with a mean intention to give a legal shape of their ill-efforts of allegation against the PCJSS workers of extortion, killing and arms-activities having been brought out by the army, intelligence forces, law &amp; order forces, BGB and administration in association with the local Awami League leadership and communal forces, the killing news of innocent three Tanchangya villagers by the ALP offshoot, a foreign armed group, was twisted and sent to the mass-media coloring it as to have been an inner-party armed conflict of PCJSS, the news of which, without having properly verified, was published in the widely-circulated media like BBC and the daily Prathom Alo, specifically, in the army-blessed news portals and online media based in CHT.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Even on occurrence of the incident, without rushing to the spot of incident and rescuing the dead bodies for autopsy, the police and administration including the Superintendent of Police of Rangamati district and Officer-in-Charge of Rajasthali police station gave a press statement towards the evening on 18 November 2019, ascertaining the incident to have been an armed conflict between the two factions of PCJSS; and it is the news media, considering the news to be genuine, began to articulate publish and telecast right from that evening within hardly 2/1 hours of the incident.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Stepping one pace ahead, the parbattanews.com well in advance rendered the news stating: &ldquo;The killed terrorists might have involved in killing of the election-duty-returnee officials in Baghaichari on 18 March 2019.&rdquo; Studying over orchestration of the channelized news on the incident, it easily gives out a conjecture that this killing incident of the innocent Tanchangya villagers was caused to happen through the ALP offshoot sponsored by the army, police and administration in association with the ruling party local leadership that chalked out the deep-political conspiracy. In fact, the innocent victims of killing were not PCJSS members and also by no way were involved in armed activities. Further to be mentioned that the local sources say that these quarters of vested interest have been trying hard by using this foreign armed group ALP to evict the Tanchangya villagers. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">It is needless to say that the reign of killing, conflict, terror, extortion and kidnapping has been installed by using the ALP sometimes introduced themselves as &lsquo;Mog Liberation Party&rsquo; &ndash; a foreign armed element and the local armed terrorists widely known as &lsquo;Reformists&rsquo;, under direct sponsorship of the state machineries and the local Awami League leadership aiming at directing the CHT crisis towards different course. And on pleas of the incidents being perpetrated by these army-backed terrorist groups, fascist-style suppression and oppression including irrespective searching of houses, filing false cases, meting out inhuman physical torture, arrest and killing have been being carried out unabatedly. </span></span></span></span></p>

At the same time, PCJSS urges an earnest call to all those news media to withdraw the baseless news rendered and republish the proper news with the factual information of the incident.</span></span></span></span></p>
