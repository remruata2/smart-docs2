Ref  :  No.PHQ/OPS-88/2021/318 dated 20th July,2022

Sir,

 With reference to the subject and letter No. cited above, details of places which are considered as communally sensitive area(s) within the state of Mizoram, highlighting the past incident(s), present situations etc. is hereby furnished below.

**1. Marpara South, Lunglei District and Marpara Mamit District**

1. An incident took place on dt. 23.12.2021 out of altercation between 5 (five) Mizo youths from Laisawral village (Lunglei District) who went to Marpara (Mamit District) for shopping. The mizo youths were disturbed by some local Chakma youth wherein they had squabbled against each other. To avoid further escalation the mizo youth then escaped to the nearby Marpara South village. However, they were pursued by the Chakma youths and being out numbered, confrontation ensued leading to simmering tension between mizo community of Laisawral and the Chakmas of Marpara. However, as a result of the prompt intervention of OC Marpara PS as well as local NGO bodies the situation was controlled without any further escalation.

 During the year 2015-2016, two mizo youths of Laisawral village who went to Marpara South were assaulted for courting Chakma girl and sustained certain minor injuries. This prompted the residents of Laisawral proceeded to Marpara South heightening tensions between the two communities. However, with the intervention of SDPO (Mamit), SDPO (Tlabung), VCs and local NGOs’, the tension was defused.

1. The said communal issues have subsided. However, due to the ethnic composition of the area, it can be considered as communally sensitive area.

**2. Saizawh West and Chawngte, Lawngtlai District**

1. On dt.04.09.2022, altercation and dispute between chakma and mizo youths of Saizawh West took place wherein chakma youths were assaulted. Having learnt about the incident, more chakma youths from Chawngte gathered and proceeded to Saizawh West village and pursued against the mizo youths creating ruckus across the whole village and the adjoining Chawngte village. MZP General Headquarters and Chakma NGOs got involved and a tense meeting was held which further resulted into de-escalation of the trouble situation between the two communities.

1. The said communal issue had subsided.

**3. Tlabung, Lunglei District**

1. In the year 1998, Pu J. Sanghleitirha, a Middle School teacher of Chawilung South was shot dead by some Chakma miscreant near Khojoisury village which is adjacent to Tlabung village. Hundreds of mizo youths from Tlabung proceeded to Khojoisury and vent out their anger by ransacking properties that belonged to the chakma villagers. In all 8 (eight) chakma houses were burnt down and several cattles were killed compelling the chakmas to run for their lives. The simmering tension lasted for the next 3-4 days.

1. The occurrence of any other such incident is not known.

1. The said communal issue had subsided.

 The town of Tlabung and Chawngte had a sizable mixed population of mizo and chakmas in terms of demography where minor issues and isolated incidents often resulted into communal issue if not promptly dealt with in the right time. In the year 1998, during the mass exodus of Brus to Tripura following the abduction and killing of Dampa Sanctuary Forest Guard Lalzawmliana, Bru community of Dinthar Tlabung fled to Tripura for fear of the wrath of the Mizos.

  The alienated attitude of the mizos towards the chakmas spearheaded by the MZP with the popular notion that chakmas of Mizoram are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh often easily ignites communal sentiments which could flare up easily.

  This is for your kind information and necessary action.

Yours faithfully,

** (K.LALREMSANGA)**
