<p style="margin-left:-41px; margin-right:-33px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Three (3) Forest Department MR workers and JCB operator and handyman were abducted on dt.18.02.13 at about 8:00 pm from Chikha anti poaching camp within Dampa Tiger Reserve. However the enduring and untiring efforts rendered by the CID (SB) Operation Team to secure the release of the hostage bear result on dt.29.03.13 (Good Friday) leading to the rescue of the five (5) hostage. In this connection, <strong>West Phaileng</strong><strong> PS C/No. 04/13 dt.20.2.2013 u/s 364(A)/ 34 IPC r/w 25(1A) Arms Act had been registered.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:-41px; margin-right:-33px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">CID (SB) Operation Team was deployed immediately by SP CID (SB) to coordinate District Police and armed Battalion in Mamit District. The Operation Team proceeded to the PO and collected various intelligence inputs. The collation of collected intelligent input suggested that the abduction was an act of several NLFT cadres and few BRU miscreants. The appearance of NLFT on the scene in connection with the case further required veracity and authenticity as never before the NLFT had created troubles for the Mizos. Within a week a breakthrough regarding the abductors was made which clearly indicated that they comprised of BRU miscreants involved in the infamous August, 2012 Zawlnuam BDO Office burglary case and NLFT cadres under the Bangladesh Sazek Area Commander. It was further realised that NLFT Bangladesh Sazek Area Commander had embraced these BRU miscreants without the consent of NLFT Headquarters and had committed such abduction act for mere want of ransom money.</span></span></span></span></p>

These dedicated associates who had unflinching allegiance to the Mizo instantly communicated with the NLFT authority, explaining the abduction of Mizos by NLFT had severely hurt the sentiments of the Mizo people as Mizoram lies not within their demand area beside coercing that such act could be detrimental for NLFT itself in the future and could have bad precedence. It is learnt from the CID (SB) Operation Team emissary that the said abduction was committed without the knowledge and consent of the NLFT Headquarters. The NLFT authority was continuously pressurised and coerced through the emissary for the immediate release of the hostage. However, internal political disturbance within Bangladesh which witnessed frequent total band beside lack of road transport and poor mobile communication within the area hindered the pace of the progress for the rescue mission. Convincing the armed cadres within the said Command Area to comply by the NLFT Headquarters decision too took time. </span></span></span></span></p>

Propagating the message that paying ransom to any insurgent group is never an option for Mizoram Government while mentioning that if things could not be settled through kind words, use of military force could be rather an option. The Team entrusted for the rescue mission had given their best simply by not confining within a particular political boundary but also within the interior of neighbouring State, including Agartala City, Dharmanagar and Jampui Hills of Tripura. </span></span></span></span></p>
