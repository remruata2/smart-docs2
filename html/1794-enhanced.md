****NEW SYSTEM OF PASSPORT VERIFICATION****

 As per advice given by Pu S.B.K Singh, IPS, DGP Mizoram on his visit to CID Special Branch on 24.09.2019, initiative has been taken to reduce the time taken for Passport verification. In this new system, all verification process was done by staff of CID (SB), who are verifying officers posted at every District in Mizoram while verification done by District executive staff was discontinued.

 With the implementation of this new system, time taken for verification of passport applicants has been reduced to a great extent. The below comparative table clearly show the impact it has on verification of passport application process.

****Comparative Table of Passport Verification Process:****

| **Old (Manual) System of Passport Verification** | **Online system of Passport Verification** **(w.e.f 01.03.2015-31.10.2019)** | **New system of Passport Verification** **(w.e.f 01.11.2019 - till date)** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Requisition for Police Passport Verification was received from Regional Passport Officer (RPO), Guwa-hati and Dy. Passport Officer (DPO) Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) Aizawl, in hard copy. In this system, there is no need for printing Personal Particulars Form (PPF), Police Verification Report (PVR) forms and other supporting documents as it is received in hard copy. | 1. Requisition for Police Passport Veri-fication was received/ downloaded through online from Passport Seva project System in soft copy. In this new system, all the PPF, PVR forms and other supporting documents need to be printed out and all the cost is borne by this Unit. | 1. Requisition for Police Passport Veri-fication was still received/downloaded through online from Passport Seva project System in soft copy. In this new system, all the PPF, PVR forms and other supporting docu-ments need to be printed out and all the cost is borne by this Unit. | In the previous systems of Pass-port verification, time taken for the completion of Passport veri-fication normally took **30 - 45 days** in remote places while in Aizawl District, it took around **15 - 20 days**to complete verification. In the **new system**, Passport verifica-tion can be completed in **3 days** within Ai-zawl District and at outside Aizawl District, it nor-mally took **5 - 7 days** to complete verification. |
| 2. RPO, Guwahati and DPO, PSK, Aizawl sent out PVR forms and PPF to both Sr.SP CID(SB) and concerned District SsP for necessary Police verification and there is no extra cost for this unit as it is received in hard coy. | 2. Due to the imple- mentation of Super-intendent of Police, Headquar-ter (SPHQ) module of Passport Seva Project, office of the Sr.SP CID(SB) downloaded and print out 2(two) sets of PPF, PVR forms and other supporting documents in respect of Passport Applicants from the PSP system and 1(one) set was further sent to concerned District SP office for necessary Police Verification and the other set (PVRs, PPF) is for CID(SB) | 2. With a view to reduce the time taken for Passport applicant verification, office of the Sr.SP CID(SB) downloaded and print out 1 (one) set of PPF, PVR form and other supporting do-cuments in respect of Passport Applicants from the PSP system. This form was sent out to concerned dis-trict Sector Officer of CID(SB). Dual verifi-cation by CID(SB) and DEF has been stop-ped and District SsP no longer receive re-quisition for Passport verification. |  In the old (ma-nual) and online system, all the PPF, PVR forms and other sup-porting documents need to be printed out in two sets and all the cost is borne by this Unit while in the **newest system**, only one set of the above noted form is needed to be printed out which resulted in cost reduction  |
| 3. On completion of necessary Police very-fication, office of the FRO &amp; Sr,SP CID(SB) submitted PVR to RPO/DPO and con-cerned district SsP submitted PVR to RPO/ DPO directly. | 3. On completion of necessary Police ve-rification, concerned district SsP submit- ted their verification report to the office of FRO&amp;SP CID (SB) and both district Police and CID(SB) very-fication reports are then compiled together and are **entered**and**approved**with ‘Digital Signa-ture Certificate’ (DSC) into the PSP system at the office of the under-signed, af-ter which Passport automatically go for **‘printing’**. | 3. On completion of necessary Police veri-fication, concerned district Sector Officer sub-mitted their veri-fication report to the office of FRO &amp; Sr. SP CID(SB) and staff of Verifica- tion Branch CID(SB) **scanned,entered**and**approved** PVR forms with ‘Digital Signa-ture Certificate’ (DSC) dongles into the PSP system at the office of the under-signed, after which Passport automatically go for **‘printing’**. |  |


 As shown in the Comparative Table, there is a huge difference in the time taken for completion of Passport verification with the implementation of new System of Passport Verification System. Stoppage of the practices of dual verification i.e. CID (SB) and District Executive Forces played a huge role in cutting down the time frame for verification. Now, only CID (SB) Headquarters and its Sector Offices located in every Districts of Mizoram conducted passport verification and relieved District Executive Forces from their heavy workload.
