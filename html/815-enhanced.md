On 6.2.2018 @ 1:00pm, around seventy (70) residence of Melbuk Village, Mizoram forcefully retrieved around twenty one (21) vehicles belonging to them which were detained by Myanmar Police from the bank of Uilui, near the Indo-Myanmar border. These vehicles were detained by the Myanmar Army with their fertilizer cargoes from 28 November, 2017.

 According to information received, these villagers, armed with guns and sharp weapons surprised the Myanmar Police personnel posted at this place during their lunch break and tied them up before taking away these vehicles.

 In the wake of this incident, Myanmar authorities lodged a complaint to the Officer-In-charge of Zokhawthar Police Out post with information given to the Indian Army officials of this area as well.

 Residence of Melbuk village claimed that they have been taking enormous efforts to reclaim these vehicles seized by Myanmar Police. They had requested the Deputy Commissioner of Teddim and Falam, Myanmar about this issue but to no avail. The owners of these vehicles have not received any seizure memo from Myanmar authorities; in fact, all they had received was that their vehicle was not confiscated. These vehicles were the main source of income for their owners and since they were not confiscated as claimed by Myanmar Police they decided to take matters in their own ways by retrieving their vehicles themselves which were detained by Myanmar Police.

 Unless proper negotiation from both sides is conducted, the consequences of this incident can not be predicted at the moment.
