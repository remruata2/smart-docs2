(i) Indo-Myanmar border Security in relation with current development in  Myanmar and impact/ Status of influx of Myanmar Nationals :

According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of unfenced International border with Myanmar, which are scattered around 30 - 40 small villages in Mizoram side. These International border posts with Myanmar are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Due to its long porous international border with Myanmar, influx of foreigners and large scale smuggling of drugs and various contrabands into the state through the porous borders has remained a serious concern for several decades.

 The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar allow Myanmar’s national to enter up to 16 kms into Mizoram Territory without any VISA restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the Indo-Myanmar.

 Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be of great assets for the government and the border guard alike.

 Having a low profile close ties with ethnic leaders of Chin Hills and Arakan-Rakhine States may also be invaluable for sharing cross-border information.

(ii) Foreigner' Movement :

Military takeover took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 whendemocratically electedmembers of Myanmar'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy, were deposed by Myanmar's Military. The Myanmar Military proclaimed a year-longstate of emergencyand declared that power had been vested inCommander-in-Chief of Defence ServicesGeneral Min Aung Hlaing.

In protest against the Military takeover that ousted the country’s democratically elected leaders, thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Myanmar. It is reported that following the Coup thousands of Myanmar nationals have taken shelter to neighboring countries viz. India, Bangladesh and Thailand. Due to close ethnic ties thousands of Myanmar Refugees mostly from Chin state fled to Mizoram and Manipur.

The Chin state of Myanmarsharesa border with six districts of Mizoram viz. Champhai, Lawngtlai, Siaha, Saitual, Hnahthial and Serchhip . Most refugees coming in from Chin are from Lai, Tedim-Zomi, Luse, Hualngo and Natu tribes, which share close links with the Mizos of Mizoram, as well as the Kuki-Zomis of Manipur.

****Information received stated that following the Coup more than 5,000 Myanmar refugees have taken shelter within Mizoram upto the month of April, 2021.
