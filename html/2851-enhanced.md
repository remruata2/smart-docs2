Dated: 5th December, 2019.

  In continuation of our SR No. 879 dated 4th December, 2019, Lai Students Association (LSA) and Students’ Union of Govt. Lawngtlai College continue their agitation today, i.e. 5.12.2019 for the third consecutive day in protest of recent transfer of 3 (three) Assistant Professors from Govt. Lawngtlai College without making replacements. About 400 students from Govt. Lawngtlai College and Govt. Regional Higher secondary School had participated in the picketing which started from 8:30 a.m. All Govt. Offices remained closed due to picketing. Student picketers dispersed at 12:45 p.m while leaders of LSA, Students Union and Class Representatives of Higher Secondary School had a consultation meeting @ 1:00 p.m on their future course of action, and decided to continue picketing tomorrow as they have not received any positive response from the Government.

 However, updated information received indicated that the agitating students upon hearing the news of Government's cancellation of previous transfer order of the 2 (two) Assistant Professors late this afternoon, had called off their agitation instantaneously.
