****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/45

Dated: 22nd January, 2019.

Information received indicated that NGO Coordination Committee (NGOCC), comprising of Central YMA (CYMA), Mizoram Upa Pawl (MUP), Mizo Hmeichhe Insuihkhawm Pawl (MHIP), Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) and Mizo Students’ Union (MSU) held a meeting yesterday, i.e. 21.01.2019 @ 3:00 p.m at CYMA Office in which they decided to boycott the celebration of Republic Day, i.e. 26.01.2019 (Saturday) throughout the State in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 which was recently passed in the Lok Sabha. Information further indicated that the NGOCC had the intention of picketing all invitees, participants, etc. from entering the venue, i.e. A.R. Lammual, for the State celebratory function which is to be held @ 8:00 a.m on the day. Requests had been made today to CYMA and MZP to refrain from physical picketing of those who have come to attend the celebratory function but to no avail. In this connection, DC, Aizawl also sent invitation to NGOCC today for a meeting tomorrow, i.e. 23.01.2019 @ 2:30 a.m at DC Conference Hall, Aizawl.

In pursuance of the decision of NGOCC, CYMA issued a notification today to all YMA Branches for the boycott of the celebratory function with an instruction to Aizawl City YMA Branches to turn up for picketing duty at A.R. Lammual entry gates on 26.01.2019 from 6:00 a.m onwards to prevent anyone from entering the venue.

Further information received indicated that NGOCCs in other districts except Lawngtlai are likely to join the boycott but detail courses of action are yet to be chalked out for their respective districts.

Immediate attention to resolve the issue is deemed absolutely necessary as there is an unlikely chance of holding a peaceful celebratory function if the NGOCC goes through with their present intention.
