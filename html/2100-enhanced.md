**POINT NO. (vii)****: DETAILS OF INSURGENCY/HISTORY AND CURRENT INSURGENT GROUPS**

**1. BRU INSURGENCY**

**HISTORY**

The Brus also called Reangs are the Nomadic Tribe living in the western belt of Mizoram, bordering Bangladesh and Tripura State. The Brus started entering into Mizoram around 1940's and engaged themselves in jhum cultivation. The Brus were living in 14 villages in Kolasib District, 11 villages in Lunglei District and 46 villages in Mamit District and spread over 9 Assembly Constituencies (i.e. Hachhek, Dampa, Mamit, Tuirial, Kolasib, Serlui, Lunglei South, Thorang and West Tuipui)

 A militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) formed in 1996 under the leadership of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news of the killing spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by Bru National Union (BNU). Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram towards Tripura.

The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps (Kaiskau, Khakchangpara, Hamsapara, Naisingpara, Asapara, Hazacherra) and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government. The Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum (MBDPF), headquartered at the Naisingpara camp on the eastern side of the Jampui Hills is an apex body for Brus living in 6 (six) refugees camps in Tripura. The Forum was created in 2002.

After holding many rounds of meetings between the Centre and the State authorities, date for repatriation of the Bru refugees was fixed i.e. 16th November, 2009. While all preparations for repatriation process are going on smoothly a Bru militant group who called themselves the Bru Revolutionary Union (BRU) killed a Mizo youth Zarzokima (17), on 13th November, 2009. It was later confirmed that killing was done deliberately by the BRU in order to deter the repatriation process.

Different armed groups which were formed by the Brus - BNA/BRA, BNLF or BLFM and BNCT are not active anymore. However, one group, Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM) was again formed under the patronage of NLFT. These BDFM cadres are the remnants of the then BLFM who refused to surrender at the time of the latter's mass surrender on 26.10.2006.

**BRU MILITANCY**

**I. BRU NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (BNLF)**

 The BNLF was formed on 9.11.1996 at Tuirum to strengthen the repeated demands of Autonomous District Council for Bru people living in western belt of Mizoram by Bru National Union.

 The founder President of BNLF Vanlalliana went to Bangladesh in the month of November 1996 and sought the advice of NLFT leader Donu Kolai (the then Dy. Chief of Army of NLFT) and with his advice and guidance, BNLF was set up, arms training and procurement of weapons have been arranged by the NLFT.

**Peace Talk with BNLF :**

 To end mistrust amongst different communities and militant activities of BNLF, Govt. of Mizoram initiated Peace Talk with leaders of BNLF w.e.f. 7.9.2001 and after 12 rounds of peace talks between Govt. of Mizoram and BNLF, an MoU was signed between BNLF and Govt. of Mizoram on 26.4.2005.

**Arms laying and temporary shelter for BNLF and family members :**

 In pursuance of MoU signed on 26.4.2005, the 195 strong BNLF cadres and their family members have been temporarily sheltered at Sidon Transit Camp, Tuipuibari. Altogether a total members of 950 including all BNLF cadres and families have been provided free ration at the rate of Rs. 10/- per adult and Rs. 5/- per minor per day.

**Resettlement :**

****Various problems created by the BLFM outfit came in the way of resettlement of BNLF as a result of which the BNLF and their family members had to stay in the Camp beyond the stipulated time.

 Finally the Govt. of Mizoram had resettled BNLF and their family members in the villages in Mizoram.

**II. BRU LIBERATION FRONT OF MIZORAM (BLFM)**

**The Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM) was formed in December, 2001 at Naisingpara refugee camp reportedly at the instance of NLFT (BM) under the leadership of Vanlalliana founder president of BNLF who was overthrown by his own men.**

 At the initial stage of forming the BLFM, the first ever major activities launched by BLFM was kidnapping of one Maxi Cab driver Lalfamkima on 1.4.2003 demanding huge amount of ransom money. This was followed by a series of activities like serving of demand letters to Mizoram villages bordering to Tripura.

With the signing of Memorandum of Understanding between BNLF (a premier Bru Insurgent Outfit) and GOM, the BLFM cadres were also expected to come over ground and join the mainstream to enjoy rehabilitation and other facilities at par with BNLF. However, this hope was shattered by the BLFM themselves by committing kidnapping of two employees of Teirei Mini Hydel Project from the dam site on 8.8.2005.

**Surrendering of BLFM Splinter Group :**

 The BLFM is a very ill-organised militant group from the very outset. A splinter group of BLFM headed by A. Zoramthanga, former Vice President and Lalrinkima, Gen. Secretary numbering 38 surrendered to the Govt. with weapons on 16.3.2006 followed by 4 cadres on 6.7.2006 and 11 cadres on 17.8.2006. Altogether 53 cadres of A. Zoramthanga faction of BLFM surrendered before Govt. of Mizoram by the turn of September, 2006.

**Rehabilitation and resettlement :**

 Govt. of Mizoram rehabilitated this group with Cash Assistance and Housing Assistance at par with the BNLF surrenderees. They were resettled at Pangbalkawn village by purchasing a plot of land for them. However, most of them have returned to refugee camps in Tripura except 6 of them who resettled at Chhimluang, Saihapui and Pangbalkawn itself.

**Surrender of 804 strong cadres of BLFM :**

Out of frustration due to arrest of their top leaders and surrender of 53 cadres of BLFM, the remaining 804 strong members of BLFM decided to lay down their arms and surrender to the Govt. unconditionally. As such, the remaining BLFM cadres, with the active participation of Assam Rifles laid down their arms on 26.10.2006 and were temporarily sheltered in two Transit Camps viz. Damparengpui and Tuipuibari. Free ration have been provided as per scale which was sanctioned by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India. However, the state Govt. has also supplement the sanction as the surrenderees have to stay in the transit camp over and above the anticipated period.

**Resettlement****:**

**** The Govt. of Mizoram took all possible steps to resettle the surrendered BLFM identified as a bonafide resident of Mizoram with their family members at the places selected by concerned District Authorities. Housing Assistance to the tune Rs. 30,000/- each was disbursed to them in two installments.

**IV. BRU REVOLUTIONARY UNION/BRU REVOLUTIONARY ARMY (BRU/BRA)**

 The Bru Revolutionary Army (BRA) was formed on early 2009, they were an armed gang operating in certain areas of Cachar and Hailakandi districts of Assam. Their source of fund is forced collection/extortion both from Bru or non-Bru families and also from company workers in their areas of operation.

**IV. UNITED DEMOCRATIC LIBERATION ARMY(UDLA)**

****The United Democratic Liberation Army was formed in 2005 by splinter group of United Democratic Liberation Front of Barak Valley (UDLFBV) led by Doinoram Reang (Bru clan). Like the BRU/BRA, they were merely an armed gang operating in certain areas of Cachar and Hailakandi districts of Assam. Their source of fund is forced collection/extortion both from Bru or non-Bru families and also from company workers in their areas of operation.

**V. BOROK NATIONAL COUNCIL OF MIZORAM (BNCT)**

 Borok National Council of Mizoram (BNCT) was formed in late 2012 under the patronage of NLFT (National Liberation Front of Tripura). They were involved in some subversive activities and 1 case of kidnapping during 2012.

**VI. BRU NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT LIBERATION FRONT OF MIZORAM (BNDLFM)/BRU DEMOCRATIC FRONT OF MIZORAM (BDFM)**

 BNDLFM are the remnants of the erstwhile BLFM who refused to surrender at the time of the later’s mass surrender on 20.10.2006. They formerly call themselves as Bru Revolutionary Army (BRA), Bru Liberation Army (BLA), Borok National Council of Mizoram (BNCT), etc. They seem to have no concrete aims and objectives and are more likely to be an armed gang rather than a well organized militant group.

 Bru militants had changed the name of BNDLFM (Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram) as BDFM (Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram) on December 2013.

 These BNDLFM/BDFM cadres are mainly responsible for the heinous crimes which occurred in the western border areas of Mizoram during the year 2013 - 2017 which included kidnapping for ransom, burglary of Government offices, etc. They were involved in 5 kidnapping cases and abducted 17 persons during the aforementioned 5 years.

**Due to the proactive steps taken by the Mizoram Police, various Bru militants as mentioned above are no longer active in Mizoram and they are now considered defunct organisations.**

**2. HMAR PEOPLES CONVENTION [HPC] AND**

**HMAR PEOPLES CONVENTION (DEMOCRATIC) [HPC(D)]**

**I. Background :**

 The Hmars, an ethnic group of Mizoram mostly settled in the North Eastern part of the State have been aspiring for a separate administrative set up mainly due to the instigation of the elite and educated members of the community who propounded that the Hmars are a separate ethnic community with distinct culture as compared to the Mizo speaking populace of Mizoram. However, it may be mentioned here that the Hmars were never regarded as a distinct ethnic community, historically and culturally. Their only distinctiveness is that they spoke the Hmar dialect which is however having very close affinity to Mizo - a dialect of the Lushei - which is now accepted as the official language of Mizoram. The Hmars also spread-out as far as Haflong in North Cachar Hills District of Assam and the Churachandpur District of Manipur. It may be mentioned here that the settlement of the Hmars in the adjoining areas of Manipur and Assam among other ethnic groups with distinct cultures and customs gradually made them ethnically self-conscious and vulnerable. This sentiment of alienation gave birth to political aspirations among the elite section of the community culminating in the formation of political platform such as the Hmar National Union (HNU) etc. in 1957 with the proclaimed objective of preserving the democratic rights, culture and ethnic identity of the Hmars within their dominated areas of Manipur and Assam.

**II. Demand for Autonomous District Council by HPC :**

 The Hmars being a dominant ethnic group of Mizoram have never felt the need nor aspired for any special political status for their community in Mizoram. They were a secured and contented community. However, mainly due to the influence of the Hmars living outside the State, politically ambitious section of the community started propounding the need for preserving their democratic rights, culture and ethnic identity. In 1986, the Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) was formed with the sole objective of the creation of an Autonomous District Council (ADC) for the Hmars within Mizoram. Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent and unlawful activities like abduction, extortion of money, attack on Mizoram Police personnel etc. and thus jeopardizing the law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area.

**III. Signing of Peace Accord :**

 The Government of Mizoram eventually managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants through the courageous and dedicated efforts of Mizoram Police which resulted into the signing of a Peace Accord between the Government of Mizoram and HPC on 27th July 1994. The HPC militants surrendered formally to the Govt. of Mizoram as per the provision of this Accord and these persons were given financial grants for their rehabilitation etc. The Govt. of Mizoram also agreed to set up the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) for the socio-economic upliftment of the people living in the Hmar dominated areas. Accordingly, Adhoc Chairman and members constituting the council were even appointed by the Govt. of Mizoram from among the leaders of the erstwhile HPC set up. Peace was thus restored in Mizoram after the signing of the Accord.

**IV. Formation of HPC (D) :**

 However, in spite of signing of the Peace Accord, there were still a disgruntled section of the HPC set up, led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate, the then General Secretary of the HPC who did not accept the Peace Accord. Lalhmingthanga Sanate formed a militant outfit called the Hmar Peoples Convention -Democratic (HPC(D)) in 1995 with its nerve centre at Hmarkhawlian (Lakhipur) in Cachar District of Assam. The HPC(D) was formed with the political objective of renewing demand for ADC under the active patronage of NSCN(I-M). In 1997, about 15-20 cadres under the command of S/S Commander-in-Chief Ropuia were sent to NSCN(IM) base camp in Bangladesh for training. They also received arms assistance from them.

 In the meantime, a new underground outfit called the Hmar Revolutionary Force (HRF) was formed in 1996 with LZ Hrangchal, former S/S Chief Marshal of HPC as its leader. It may be noted that the HPC did not surrender all their arms to the Government of Mizoram in 1994. They have secretly kept about 14 (fourteen) numbers of sophisticated weapons un-surrendered which they claimed were borrowed from the NSCN(I/M), and that the weapons were already returned to the NSCN(IM). The facts remained, however, that these weapons were meant for future use in the pretext of safeguarding the Hmar tribes. They were also in friendly terms with the PREPAK and UNLF. The group however, surrendered before Govt. of Mizoram in 1999 after experiencing armed conflict with rival HPC (D).

**V. Objective :**

 The purported objective of the HPC (D) over the years has changed from an autonomous district council covering the north and north eastern Mizoram to an independent Hmar State consisting of the Hmar inhabited areas of Mizoram, Manipur and Assam.

**VI.** **Areas of Operation:**

 The HPC (D) are active primarily in the north eastern areas of (i.e. some portions of Kolasib District and Aizawl District which are dominated by the Hmars) Mizoram, the Hmar dominated areas of Churachandpur District in Manipur and the Cachar and North Cachar Hill Districts of Assam.

**VII.** **Split****in Hmar Peoples Convention (D):**

 HPC(D) split into two factions on 29.9.2011. One faction is led by H.Zosangbera, Gen. Secretary and another faction by the deposed President Lalhmingthanga Sanate. Restructuring of leaders of the two factions.****

**GROUNDS FOR BANNING OF HPC(D) AS UNLAWFUL ASSOCIATION**

**(1)** HPC(D)leaders/activists have been indulging in acts of intimidation, extortion and  forceful donations from civilian population for raising funds for their organization in  different parts of Mizoram.

****(2)**Holding secret meetings, making strategies to induct new members, working in  tandem with like-minded other insurgent groups of the North Eastern Region for  carrying out acts of extortion and intimidation.**

**(3)** HPC(D) has taken up arms to achieve their objective.
