1. At Present there is no record of the presence of IIG's camp inside Myanmar adjacent to Mizoram. However, if there is any information regarding the existence/establishment of such camps, let there be joint operation to flush out such camps.

2. Let it be reiterated that better sharing of intelligence inputs between Government of India and Government of Myanmar be emphasized especially around the Indo - Myanmar Border. As such, the establishment of Hotline to SP Saiha District and SP Champhai District with the Myanmar Government in the bordering post be given priority to combat the movement of Insurgents, Arms smugglers and Drug traffickers etc.

3. The recent seizures of Arms cache, Narcotic drugs and Hides / skin of protected and endangered animals reportedly indicates that Mizoram and Manipur has been used as a route to smuggle arms, Narcotics etc, to India, this unwanted infiltrations could only be eliminated by the efforts of both Government. Therefore Borders post in both sides should be more alert and stingent actions be taken against such infilltators.

4. Let the interrrogations result of captured Insurgents groups, Arms Smugglers, Drug trffickers be Shared uniformly to have better control of unwanted movement in the border.

****Drugs trafficking****

 Inspite of massive efforts made by both Government to put on end to the infiltration of Narcotic Drugs. The numbers of Narcotic Drugs related case in Mizoram alone involving Myanmar nationals during the last five years (2005 - 2009) is 217 Nos. and 2010 April - 2011 March is 61 Nos. Moreover it has been found out from interrogation that this Drugs had been pushed inside India from Myanmar by Myanmarese. Therefore more efforts should be given by both the Government to stop this influx to Narcotics. This can be achieve by better co-operation, sharing of information and systematic co-ordination between both the Government.
