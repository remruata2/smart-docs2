**Ethnic conflict in Mizoram:**

Mizoram is inhabited by several ethnic people who speak various kuki-chin languages and the term ‘Mizo’ is rather an umbrella name for all the different tribes residing in the State. The multi-ethnic and pluralistic state of Mizoram has numerous communities, such as, Lusei, Pawi, Lakher (Mara), Chakma, Hmar, etc.

Although Mizoram in considered to be one of the most peaceful State in the country, it has its own share of problems in the past, such as, armed insurgency, ethnic tensions, etc. Successive Governments over the years has done commendable job in transforming Mizoram to be ‘an island of peace’ in a troubled North-eastern region.

Conflicts in Mizoram are mostly in the form of demand for autonomous district council or certain autonomy and it assumes struggle against the Government and not between a particular ethnic communities per se.

There are at present 3 (three) autonomous district council in Mizoram, viz., Lai Autonomous District Council (LADC), Mara Autonomous District Council (MADC) &amp;Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC). The Hmar Community residing in north-eastern part of the State are under Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC).

**A. PEOPLES CONVENTION [HPC] AND HMAR PEOPLES CONVENTION (DEMOCRATIC) [HPC(D)]**

**1. Background :**

 The Hmars, an ethnic group of Mizoram mostly settled in the North Eastern part of the State have been aspiring for a separate administrative set up mainly due to the instigation of the elite and educated members of the community who propounded that the Hmars are a separate ethnic community with distinct culture as compared to the Mizo speaking populace of Mizoram. However, it may be mentioned here that the Hmars were never regarded as a distinct ethnic community, historically and culturally. Their only distinctiveness is that they spoke the Hmar dialect which is however having very close affinity to Mizo - a dialect of the Lushei - which is now accepted as the official language of Mizoram. The Hmarsalso spread-out as far as Haflong in North Cachar Hills District of Assam and the Churachandpur District of Manipur. It may be mentioned here that the settlement of the Hmars in the adjoining areas of Manipur and Assam among other ethnic groups with distinct cultures and customs gradually made them ethnically self-conscious and vulnerable. This sentiment of alienation gave birth to political aspirations among the elite section of the community culminating in the formation of political platform such as the Hmar National Union (HNU) etc. in 1957 with the proclaimed objective of preserving the democratic rights, culture and ethnic identity of the Hmars within their dominated areas of Manipur and Assam.

**2. Demand for Autonomous District Council by HPC :**

 In 1986, the Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) was formed with the sole objective of the creation of an Autonomous District Council (ADC) for the Hmars within Mizoram. Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent and unlawful activities like abduction, extortion of money, attack on Mizoram Police personnel etc. and thus jeopardizing the law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area.

**3. Signing of Peace Accord :**

 The Government of Mizoram eventually managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants through the courageous and dedicated efforts of Mizoram Police which resulted into the signing of a Peace Accord between the Government of Mizoram and HPC on 27th July 1994. The HPC militants surrendered formally to the Govt. of Mizoram as per the provision of this Accord and these persons were given financial grants for their rehabilitation etc. The Govt. of Mizoram also agreed to set up the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) for the socio-economic upliftment of the people living in the Hmar dominated areas. Accordingly, Adhoc Chairman and members constituting the council were even appointed by the Govt. of Mizoram from among the leaders of the erstwhile HPC set up. Peace was thus restored in Mizoram after the signing of the Accord.

**4. Formation of HPC (D) :**

 However, in spite of signing of the Peace Accord, there were still a disgruntled section of the HPC set up, led by LalhmingthangaSanate, the then General Secretary of the HPC who did not accept the Peace Accord. LalhmingthangaSanate formed a militant outfit called the Hmar Peoples Convention -Democratic (HPC(D)) in 1995 with its nerve centre at Hmarkhawlian (Lakhipur) in Cachar District of Assam. The HPC(D) was formed with the political objective of renewing demand for ADC under the active patronage of NSCN(I-M).

 In the meantime, a new underground outfit called the Hmar Revolutionary Force (HRF) was formed in 1996 with LZ Hrangchal, former S/S Chief Marshal of HPC as its leader. It may be noted that the HPC did not surrender all their arms to the Government of Mizoram in 1994. They have secretly kept about 14 (fourteen) numbers of sophisticated weapons un-surrendered which they claimed were borrowed from the NSCN(I/M), and that the weapons were already returned to the NSCN(IM). The facts remained, however, that these weapons were meant for future use in the pretext of safeguarding the Hmar tribes. They were also in friendly terms with the PREPAK and UNLF. The group however, surrendered before Govt. of Mizoram in 1999 after experiencing armed conflict with rival HPC (D).

**5. Objective :**

 The purported objective of the HPC (D) over the years has changed from an autonomous district council covering the north and north eastern Mizoram to an independent Hmar State consisting of the Hmar inhabited areas of Mizoram, Manipur and Assam.

**6. Split in Hmar Peoples Convention (D):**

 HPC(D) split into two factions on 29.9.2011. One faction is led by H.Zosangbera, Gen. Secretary and another faction by the deposed President LalhmingthangaSanate.

**B. NOTES ON THE ISSUES OF BRU MILITANCY & BRU REFUGEES HISTORY**

The Brus also called Reangs are the Nomadic Tribe living in the western belt of Mizoram, bordering Bangladesh and Tripura State. The Brus started entering into Mizoram around 1940's and engaged themselves in jhum cultivation. The Brus were living in 14 villages in Kolasib District, 11 villages in Lunglei District and 46 villages in Mamit District and spread over 9 Assembly Constituencies (i.e. Hachhek, Dampa, Mamit, Tuirial, Kolasib, Serlui, Lunglei South, Thorang and West Tuipui)

A militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) formed in 1996 under the leadership of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news of the killing spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by Bru National Union(BNU). Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram towards Tripura.

The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps (Kaiskau, Khakchangpara, Hamsapara, Naisingpara, Asapara, Hazacherra) and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government. The Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum (MBDPF), headquartered at the Naisingpara camp on the eastern side of the Jampui Hills is an apex body for Brus living in 6 (six) refugees camps in Tripura. The Forum was created in 2002.

After holding many rounds of meetings between the Centre and the State authorities, date for repatriation of the Bru refugees was fixed i.e. 16th November, 2009. While all preparations for repatriation process are going on smoothly a Bru militant group who called themselves the Bru Revolutionary Union (BRU) killed a Mizo youth Zarzokima (17), on 13th November, 2009. It was later confirmed that killing was done deliberately by the BRU in order to deter the repatriation process.

Different armed groups which were formed by the Brus - BNA/BRA, BNLF or BLFM and BNCT are not active anymore. However, one group, Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM) was again formed under the patronage of NLFT. These BDFM cadres are the remnants of the then BLFM who refused to surrender at the time of the latter's mass surrender on 26.10.2006.

**BRU MILITANCY**

1. **BRU NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (BNLF)**

The BNLF was formed on 9.11.1996 at Tuirum to strengthen the repeated demands of Autonomous District Council for Bru people living in western belt of Mizoram by Bru National Union.

 The founder President of BNLF Vanlalliana went to Bangladesh in the month of November 1996 and sought the advice of NLFT leader DonuKolai (the then Dy. Chief of Army of NLFT) and with his advice and guidance, BNLF was set up, arms training and procurement of weapons have been arranged by the NLFT.

**Activities :**

 A Conference convened by BNU which was held at Saipuilui Village of Mamit District on 23-24 Sept 1997 passed a resolution demanding separate Autonomous District Council for Brus in Western Belt of Mizoram. Mizos living in this belt reacted immediately against the said resolution as a result of which the situation in this area had become tense between the two communities.

 To make matter worst, PuLalzawmliana, Wild Life Game Watcher of Forest Department was killed by some unknown miscreants and his two companion viz. Jutendro and (2) Ngaihdama had also been abducted on 21.10.1997. The two abducted persons resurfaced at Dampa Sanctuary on 24.10.1997 and revealed that the deceased was murdered by 10 armed Bru militant group.

 The general public of Bru Community were also threatened by Bru militants to leave Mizoram and to escape the wrath of Police and Mizos due to the murder of the Forest Game Watcher. As a result, a large number of Bru people fled Mizoram in the last part of 1997 and they settled at Tripura North District as refugees.

Numerous activities like robbing, assault of innocent civilians and endless demand letter of money have been served to the people of Mizos living in the western belt of Mizoram by the BNLF.

**Peace Talk with BNLF :**

 To end mistrust amongst different communities and militant activities of BNLF, Govt. of Mizoram initiated Peace Talk with leaders of BNLF w.e.f. 7.9.2001 and after 12 rounds of peace talks between Govt. of Mizoram and BNLF, anMoU was signed between BNLF and Govt. of Mizoram on 26.4.2005.

**Arms laying and temporary shelter for BNLF and family members :**

 In pursuance of MoU signed on 26.4.2005, the 195 strong BNLF cadres and their family members have been temporarily sheltered at Sidon Transit Camp, Tuipuibari. Altogether a total members of 950 including all BNLF cadres and families have been provided free ration.

**Resettlement :**

****Various problems created by the BLFM outfit came in the way of resettlement of BNLF as a result of which the BNLF and their family members had to stay in the Camp beyond the stipulated time.

Finally the Govt. of Mizoram had resettled BNLF and their family members in the following villages as under:-

| **Sl.** **No** | Village | **Cadre** | **Adult** | **Minor** | **Total** | **Date of leaving Transit Camp** |

**Rehabilitation package and Housing Assistance :**

 The Govt. of Mizoram had sanctioned Rs. 50,000/- and Rs. 30,000/- as rehabilitation package and Housing Assistance respectively for each BNLF cadre from the fund received from Central Govt.

****Ration Card etc:****

These Ex-BNLF cadres were issued ration card in their respective villages and also enrolled in the electoral roll and also issued Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) except those resettled in Tumpanglui. A school under SSA Scheme was also opened particularly in PathianTlang and Tumpanglui.

**II. BRU LIBERATION FRONT OF MIZORAM (BLFM)**

**The Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM) was formed in December, 2001 at Naisingpara refugee camp reportedly at the instance of NLFT (BM) under the leadership of Vanlalliana founder president of BNLF who was overthrown by his own men.**

 At the initial stage of forming the BLFM, the first ever major activities launched by BLFM was kidnapping of one Maxi Cab driver Lalfamkima on 1.4.2003 demanding huge amount of ransom money. This was followed by a series of activities like serving of demand letters to Mizoram villages bordering to Tripura.

With the signing of Memorandum of Understanding between BNLF (a premier Bru Insurgent Outfit) and GOM, the BLFM cadres were also expected to come over ground and join the mainstream to enjoy rehabilitation and other facilities at par with BNLF. However, this hope was shattered by the BLFM themselves by committing kidnapping of two employees of Teirei Mini Hydel Project from the dam site on 8.8.2005.

The BLFM further intensified their activities inside Mizoram villages by forcible collection of donations from innocent civilians of Mizoram resulting into Counter Operation by Mizoram Police. There have been four armed encounter since then wherein three BLFM cadres sustained bullet injuries. On 11.1.2006, the BLFM on their way back to their camp open deliberate firing towards the MAP post of New Kawnpui located at Tripura - Mizoram border.

 With the initiative of 36 AR, Kanchanpur, 38 Nos. of BLFM cadres including Vice President, General Secretary and other senior officers with 14 nos. of different types of arms surrendered to Govt. of Mizoram.

**Surrendering of BLFM Splinter Group :**

 The BLFM is a very ill-organised militant group from the very outset. A splinter group of BLFM headed by A. Zoramthanga, former Vice President and Lalrinkima, Gen. Secretary numbering 38 surrendered to the Govt. with weapons on 16.3.2006 followed by 4 cadres on 6.7.2006 and 11 cadres on 17.8.2006. Altogether 53 cadres of A. Zoramthanga faction of BLFM surrendered before Govt. of Mizoram by the turn of September, 2006.

**Rehabilitation and resettlement :**

 Govt. of Mizoram rehabilitated this group with Cash Assistance and Housing Assistance at par with the BNLF surrenderees. They were resettled at Pangbalkawn village by purchasing a plot of land for them. However, most of them have returned to refugee camps in Tripura except 6 of them who resettled at Chhimluang, Saihapui and Pangbalkawn itself.

**Arrest of President, etc.**

In the aftermath of the surrender of 38 BLFM cadres, four BLFM top brass leaders viz. (1) Vanlalliana, President, (2) Vanrama, Vice President (3) RomawiaMeska, COAS and (4) Lallawma, SS Capt. were arrested on 20.4.2006 in a joint operation of Mizoram Police SB and Assam Rifles of Kanchanpur code name Operation Black Hound which was another major blow to the BLFM.

**Surrender of 804 strong cadres of BLFM :**

Out of frustration due to arrest of their top leaders and surrender of 53 cadres of BLFM, the remaining 804 strong members of BLFM decided to lay down their arms and surrender to the Govt. unconditionally. As such, the remaining BLFM cadres, with the active participation of Assam Rifles laid down their arms on 26.10.2006 and were temporarily sheltered in two Transit Camps viz. Damparengpui and Tuipuibari. Free ration have been provided as per scale which was sanctioned by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India. However, the state Govt. has also supplement the sanction as the surrenderees have to stay in the transit camp over and above the anticipated period.

**Identification of surrendered BLFM****:**

****Although the Govt. accepted the BLFM cadres as surrendered militant, identification of bonafide Mizoram Bru was felt necessary for their further resettlement in Mizoram. In this regard, Govt. officials and NGOs were sent to their respective Transit Camp and out of 804 BLFM cadres, 731 were identified as genuine Mizoram Brus.

**Resettlement****:**

 The Govt. of Mizoram took all possible steps to resettle the surrendered BLFM identified as a bonafide resident of Mizoram with their family members at the places selected by concerned District Authorities. Housing Assistance to the tune Rs. 30,000/- each was disbursed to them in two installments.

The Govt. of Mizoram has taken various steps for the permanent settlement of the surrendered BLFM which could not be materialized due to the absence of active co-operation of the leader of BLFM in respect of proposals for their resettlement.

The meeting held in the office chamber of Chief Secretary of Mizoram on 29.8.08 reiterated the need for actionable plan for settlement of surrendered BLFM and District concerned administration are instructed to go ahead with the allocation of house site at the places earmarked for their resettlement.

The surrendered BLFM in the transit camp were issued Job card under NREGS Scheme as far as practicable.

**Due to the proactive steps taken by the Mizoram Police, various Bru militants as mentioned above are no longer active in Mizoram and they are now considered defunct organisations.**

**BRU REFUGEES & BRU REPATRIATION**

**I. GENESIS**

 The BNU conference held in September, 1997 at Saipuilui village in Mamit District adopted a resolution for creation of Autonomous District Council for Brus in the western part of Mizoram which was strongly objected by the Mizo community in the concerned area. At the same time a militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) which was formed in 1996 under the leadership of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became more and more active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news about the killing had spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by BNU. Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram at the instance of the BNLF for their operational convenience.

 The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government.

 The Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF) who took arms against the state of Mizoram since 1996 laid down their arms to the Govt. of Mizoram on 25th July, 2005 after 13(thirteen) rounds of Peace Talks between Govt. of Mizoram and BNLF. As many as 195 BNLF surrendered.
