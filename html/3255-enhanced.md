Asteria’s CYGNUS A10 is a mini Unmanned Aerial System designed from the ground up for military and civilian surveillance applications. The system consists of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a MissionControl Station (MCS). The UAV flies autonomously from takeoff to landing and carries a high resolution daylight/infraredcamera for aerial observation. The MCS displays real-time video from the UAV and allows the user to command and control the UAV.

The CYGNUS A10 differentiates itself from its competitors by being the first-in-class UAS to deliver real-time HD resolution aerial video. This is 5x more video resolution than standard definition video streamed by existing UAS. This innovation allows operators to spot much greater detail in their aerial images and videos leading to higher effectiveness of the system. The high definition daylight camera can be swapped with an infrared camera for night time operations.

SALIENT FEATURES

- **Mobile**– Small, lightweight and modular for rapid deployment
- **Autonomous**– Automatic takeoff, navigation and landing
- **Effective**– Delivers real-time HD resolution video from the UAV to the ground station.
- **Terrain Independent**– No runway is required and as such operable in any terrain
- **Reliable**– All composites construction for robust all-weather operation
- **Secure**– Encrypted digital data link for secure transmission of data and video
- **Safe**– Failsafe mechanisms to protect the system
- **Stealthy**– Silent electrical propulsion, inaudible at 150 m
