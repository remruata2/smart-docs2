****WRITE UP ON AGENDA FOR DGP's MEETING TO BE HELD ON 25.10.2013 AT 15:00 HRS IN CONFERENCE ROOM (ROOM NO.119, NORTH BLOCK) MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS, NEW DELHI.****

**Status of Internal Security Scenario in Mizoram**:

The overall security situation in Mizoram state by and large is peaceful. However, communities represented by the Hmar People Convention(Democratic) in the Northeast and Northwest of Mizoram bordering Manipur and Assam states and Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram representing the Bru communities in the Southwest and western belt of Mizoram bordering Bangladesh and Tripura have been indulging in criminal activities. The recent glaring example felt in the Inter-State and International border areas recently was HPC-D, a Manipur based militant group of Hmar community who summoned four village leaders of Sakawrdai village(Mizoram-Manipur border) by the S/S Army Chief of HPC(D) in the first week of October, 2013 at a location near Patpuihmun village, Manipur giving diktat that no individual, NGO or political parties within Sinlung Hills Development Council area should undertake any activity for the ensuing Mizoram General Election and they should co-operate with cadres of HPC(D) who are being sent to infiltrate into various villages within the HPC(D) demand area and to convey a message to the Govt. of Mizoram that the HPC(D) strongly resented the Government's attitude for non-resumption of peace talk and also the kidnapping of 5 Forest Muster Roll workers and 3 Gautam Construction Company workers at the Indo-Bangla border by Tripura based militant groups, i.e. NLFT &amp; Bru militant group.

 As per latest revision of Electoral Rolls, there are 6,86,305 voters/electors in the state of Mizoram. The total number of female voters is 3,49,506 and total number of male voters is 3,36,799. Out of 1126 Polling Stations, 6 polling stations are identified as Most Critical, 84 polling stations are Critical, and 1036 polling stations are identified as Normal polling stations.

 The analysis on security and law&amp; order sensitivity are highlighted as shown below :

**1. Mizoram-Tripura/Bangladesh border:**

Underground groups such as Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram (BNDLFM), Bru National Army (BNA), Bru Liberation Army (BLA) and National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) have intensified their activities within Mamit District since 2008. These underground groups have particularly been involved in Abduction/Kidnapping/Extortion cases in all the three assembly constituencies viz Hachhek, Dampa and Mamit within Mamit District during the last 4-5 years. The latest being the recent abduction of 5 Forest Muster Roll workers and 3 Gautam Construction Company workers in the month of June, 2013 at the Indo-Bangla border by Tripura based militant groups, i.e. NLFT &amp; Bru militant group.

 The overall Mamit District on election security perspective is relatively peaceful as no poll related violence is reported during the last general election. However, the recent abduction/kidnapping/extortion cases reported especially on the western side of the district bordering Bangladesh and Tripura coupled with the presence of anti-repatriation elements amongst Bru electors warranted some of the polling stations within the three constituencies of Mamit district to be declared as critical in the context of election.

**2.** **Mizoram - Assam border:**

During the last 4-5 years, the Hmar People’s Convention (Democrats) had indulged in intimidation /extortion activities within Kolasib District of Mizoram - Assam border. In the early part of 2012, HPC (D) had served/issued a diktat for dissolution of YMA Branches to different villages and also served extortion notice to different Village councils especially within Serlui constituency.

Village council polls in two villages i.e Saiphai and Saipum under Kolasib District could not be held as per schedule on February 23, 2012 due to law and order situation and the village council terms were extended in the two villages. While the state election commission tried to conduct elections again in October, 2012, no one filed papers despite three-time postponement of the last date for filing nominations due to threat induced by the HPC(D) to all political party leaders in the area to boycott the village council polls.

Kolasib District as stated above has Hmar dominated villages especially in Serlui constituency, causing the Hmar People’s Convention (Democratic) to have political influence on the electorate in some villages. The other two constituencies namely Tuirial and Kolasib by and large are calm, peaceful and no pre-poll, poll and post-poll related violence is reported during the last general election.

**3. Mizoram - Manipur border:**

In Aizawl District, two constituencies namely Tuivawl and Chalfilh are affected by the activities of HPC (D). During the early part of 2012, HPC (D) had served /issued a diktat for dissolution of YMA Branches to different villages and also serve extortion notice to different Village councils especially within Tuivawl and Chalfilh constituencies.

Village council polls in 13 villages under Aizawl District could not be held on February 23, 2012 due to law and order situation and extended the village council terms in the area. While the state election commission tried to conduct elections again in October, 2012, no one filed nomination papers despite three-time postponement of last date for filing nominations due to threat induced by the HPC(D) to all political party leaders in the area to boycott the village council polls.

In light of the above circumstances, it can be inferred that except Tuivawl and Chalfilh constituencies, all the remaining constituencies within Aizawl District are comparatively free from any serious electoral offences like intimidation, etc.. during the last 4-5 years.

**4. Mizoram - Myanmar border:**

Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) of Manipur and Chin National Front (CNF) of Myanmar though reportedly having low activities in the area could have political influence in some villages under Lengteng, East Tuipui, Champhai North, Champhai South constituencies. In June 2004, ZRA militants alleged that the Mizo National Front (MNF) government in Mizoram partially paid the group for campaigning for its candidates in Champhai constituency. In East Tuipui constituency, five (5) polling stations namely: Vaphai-I, Vaphai-II, Saikhumphai, Farkawn-I and Farkawn-II are identified as most critical due to the incident at Saikhumphai on 29.4.2013 and the subsequent major law and order problem in regard to the question of illegal settlement of Saikhumphai settlers and the persistent friction between Farkawn and Vaphai.

In short, it can be concluded that due to the Saikhumphai fallout, some of the polling stations are critical owing to their closeness to Myanmar border and possible influence from Myanmar based-underground groups like CNF, ZRA. However, the overall security threats perception of the remaining part of the Champhai District on election issue is relatively peaceful.

 Out of the three constituencies within Serchhip District, only Hrangturzo constituency could have potential political threats in two polling stations namely Sailulak and Lungkawlh from Chin National Front of . The security situation of the district is by and large peaceful.

**5. Mizoram - Bangladesh/Myanmar border:**

Some villages falling under two constituencies namely Thorang and West Tuipui in Lunglei District which are located on the Bangladesh international border could have potential threats to the election from some underground groups i.e National Liberation Front of Tripura, Jono Songho Somiti , United Democratic People Front having bases inside Bangladesh. In general, the record shows that pre-poll, poll and post poll violence are not reported during the last election in Lunglei District. Therefore, no serious election security threats are perceived till today in Lunglei District. However, any possible influences of Bangladesh based-underground groups need to be closely watched especially on the area bordering Bangladesh side. 

Lawngtlai district is located in the south-western most part of Mizoram having international boundaries with Bangladesh to the west and Myanmar to the south. Possible political influence of Bangladesh based-underground groups such as: NLFT, JSS (Jana Sanghati Samity) and UPDF (United People’s Democratic Front) cannot be ruled out though such imminent threats are not perceived at the moment. During the last general election no poll related violence is reported within the district.

Saiha district is bounded on the north and northwest by Lunglei District on the west by Lawngtlai District and on the south and east by Myanmar. Due to its nearness to international border with Bangladesh and presence of many insurgent outfits like Mara People Army (MPA), CNA, NSCN (IM) and JSS in this area, any indulgence of such outfits in commission of electoral offences like intimidation, booth capturing, impersonation, etc.. cannot be rule out though such imminent threats are not perceived at the moment. The past general election record within the district shows that no pre-poll, poll and post-poll violence are reported in the district.

**Sypnosis**:

 Mizoram, having a porous international border of 404 kms. with Myanmar, 318 kms. with Bangladesh and inter-state border of 66 kms. with Tripura, 123 kms. with Assam and 95 kms. with Manipur, and often boasted to be the most peaceful state in the country is not completely free from the activities of anti-social elements. Taking advantage of its peaceful atmosphere, certain insurgent outfits and arms smugglers of the neighbouring states sometimes utilized for transporting/smuggling arms and drugs. Though no election security threats have been perceived till today in the entire State, a careful watch may be maintained until all the election process is completed.
