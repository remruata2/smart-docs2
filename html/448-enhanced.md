No.MSB/CB/SR/B-69/  Dated Aizawl,the Oct.2019

To

 The Deputy Inspector General of Police (CID),

 Mizoram, Aizawl.

Subj:-  Clarification on Special Report dated 3.10.2019

Ref :- No.PHQ/IGP(HQRS)/Misc/2018/141/ dated 4.10.2019

Sir,

 With due respect, I am to state that the number of Brus reported as repatriated on dt.3.10.2019 was incorrectly shown in the Special Report as 48 families with 194 members, whereas the correct figure after necessary confirmation were sought is 48 families with 192 members. The error occurred due to misinformation received from Khakchangpara Relief Camp. Whereas the report received was 1 family with 3 members, the actual figure is 1 family with just 1 member.

 As far as this office is concerned, ‘Kaskau’ has somehow always been written as ‘Kaiskau’. Henceforth, the correct name ‘Kaskau’ will be used.

 Error on the part of the undersigned is deeply regretted.

Yours faithfully,

(B.LALDINGNGHETA)Addl.SP,

For Sr.Superintendent of Police,

CID(SB), Mizoram, Aizawl.
