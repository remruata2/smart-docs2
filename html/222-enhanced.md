Subject: Report on Threat perception assessment

 (Through the proper channel)

Ref:  No. MSB/CB/B-19(A)/608 dt. 25.9.2018

Sir,

 With reference to the above cited letter number, a comprehensive Threat perception assessment for Pravindra Yadav, Accountant General, Mizoram was conducted by self as directed. It may be recollected that the said official had recently confronted by his contractual employees regarding termination of their service from his office, and also latter warned by the Mizo Zirlai Pawl by threatening him not to come back to Mizoram without settling the matters with his contract employees (i.e. to further extent their services). The said imbroglio even caused closure of AG office for a few days as the MZP members intended to storm the AG in his office during those days. As of now, the matter is not yet settled and the AG has not yet returned from Delhi availing his leave.

It may be noted that, in the above mentioned recent confrontation, things was flared up sensitively as soon as the MZP interfered on the matter. Had not the AG immediately left Mizoram during that day, worst situation could happen for him, his family and his office as well since termination of his 30 contract employees’ from their services was never a simple matter as the said employees been used their wages to support their families for almost over 8 years.

Since there is no recent news from the AG himself about having an intention to extent the mentioned employees’ services and also that there is no news from the MZP about suspension of their warning to the AG, it can be assume that when the AG join from his leave, the said matter will surely be bring up again by the MZP as well as the contract employees themselves and if matters is not settled by then, worst scenario than recent confrontation can possibly happen.

Considering the above mentioned points, it was concluded provision of static CRPF/Police security cover for the office premises and the residence of the Accountant General, Mizoram is highly recommended for the time being i.e. until the present misunderstanding between AG/MZP/Contract employees is reconciled.

.

  Yours faithfully,
