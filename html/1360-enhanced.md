****COMMENTS FOR/AGAINST CLOSURE OF THE FOLLOWING BOPs****

| **Sl.No.** | **BOPs** |  **Comments**  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  1. |  Mualthuam |  The BOP of Mualthuam is located at a strategic point along Mizoram-Tripura border and had been the infiltration point of Bru militants. As of now, no Bru militant activities had been reported in this area. However, the issue of closing of Mualthuam BOP needs further discussion.  |
|  2. |  Zawlpui |  Previously, the village of Zawlpui was one of the entry point of Bru militants crossing from Tripura side. However, in recent past no Bru militant activities had been reported in this area. It is therefore suggested that the BOP of Zawlpui may be closed. At the same time, this area can be covered from BOP of Borai and Zawlnuam Outpost.  |
|  3. |  Bungthuam |  No criminal activities of any insurgent group had been reported after the sensational murder of Zarzokima in 2009. Moreover, the BOP is located near BOP of Borai and Kanhmun PS. Hence, Bungthuam BOP may be closed. Further, any security threat in the area can be effectively checked from Borai BOP and Kanhmun Police Station.  |
|  4. |  Thinghlun |  Any security threat in the area can be effectively prevented and checked from Borai &amp; Kolalian BOPs and Kanhmun PS. Hence, Thinghlun BOP may be closed down.  |
|  5. |  Zamuang |  No insurgent group activities have been reported in this area for a long period of time. Any security threat in the area can be effectively prevented and checked from Saikhawthlir BOP and Zawlnuam OP. Hence, Zamuang BOP may be closed.  |


**Note:-** _Closing down of Bunghmun BOP_.

 There has been no report of insurgent activities along Hachek  range especially from Tuidam to Serhmun Village for a long period of  time. Hence, closing down of Bunghmun BOP may be taken into  consideration for deliberation / discussion.
