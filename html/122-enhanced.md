No.MSB/CB/A-86(I)/2014/  Dated Aizawl, the, 1st Apr/2014

To,

 The Joint Chief Electoral Officer,

 Mizoram, Aizawl

Sub:- **Issues relating to voting by Brus in Tripura Camps**.

Sir,

 Please refer to your letter No.H.11018/4/2014-CEO dated 31.03.2014 addressed to the DGP Mizoram regarding the meeting of the NGOs with the Chief Electoral Officer on the issue of voting by Brus in Tripura camps, and their strong resentment to the same, implying also possible disruption when the polled materials are brought back to Aizawl for counting.

 In your letter, it has been mentioned that the polled materials are scheduled to be brought back to Aizawl on 4.4.2014 as per the instructions of the Election Commission of India. This will be well before the date of polling, i.e., 09.04.2014, in Mizoram and, apart from being strongly resented by the NGOs, this will also have possible implications of becoming a poll issue and vitiating the peaceful polling atmosphere in Mizoram.

 As you would be aware, the issue of voting by Brus in Tripura Camps has been protested against very strongly by several NGOs of Mizoram. The NGOs took out a large procession on 24.3.2014 expressing their resentment in an extremely vocal manner. Besides gathering in a large number outside the office of the CEO, the NGOs also burnt copies of ballot papers to express their strong reservations against the voting by Brus in Tripura camps. Thereafter also, these NGOs have constantly been advocating against the decision of the Election Commission of India to allow such voting, and now, there is a strong possibility that this resentment will grow further and take more virulent forms. The fact that polling materials alongwith some polling officials were dispatched to Tripura inspite of their strong protests, also seems to have further strengthened their resolve to organize even stronger protests. In fact, their meeting the CEO in this regard and implying possible disruption when the polling materials are brought back for counting to Aizawl, is a strong pointer to their possible future plans. It may not be out of place to mention that in the past also, on emotive and sensitive issues, there have been instances of disruption of counting of ballots inside the Counting Hall itself.,

 In view of the above and as per intelligence reports, the possibility of the NGOs undertaking some extreme forms of violent protest including disruption, or even possible damage, as and when the polled materials are brought back for counting in Aizawl, is very high. Even though necessary police arrangements will be made by Mizoram Police, there is bound to be a violent confrontation with the NGOs which may have serious law and order implications.

This aspect has also been highlighted in the Mizoram Police Special Branch Daily Summary of Information/Election related report dated 31.3.2014.

Taking into consideration the emotive nature of the issue, the unprecedented solidarity this time among the NGOs in their protest against the same, as also the imminent likelihood of strong and violent protests and disruption/damage when the polled materials are brought for counting to Aizawl it is strongly suggested that alternative arrangements may be made by the office of the CEO for counting of the votes polled in the Bru camps instead of bringing them back to Mizoram. In this regard, from the point of view of security of the polled materials as well as the serious law and order implications, the option of having the counting done in Tripura itself should also be seriously explored.

 ( This issues with the approval of DGP/Mizoram)

Yours faithfully,
