****KIDNAPPING CASES COMMITTED BY NLFT/BDFM SINCE 2012****

 The National Liberation Front of Tripura and Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram combined have intensified their activities during the recent past in the Indo-Bangladesh border of Mamit District in Mizoram. During the last two years alone, these two combined militant groups had committed as many as 7(seven) times of kidnapping from Mamit District alone and 33(thirty three) held hostage. Most of the kidnapping has been committed by these groups for ransom. Apart from the suffering of hostages and their family members, every kidnapping in this area had caused communal tension between Brus and Mizos which is a big headache for the Government. The Bru militant group, with the help of NLFT had temporary camp at Sazek range of Bangladesh bordering Dampa Tiger Reserve Sanctuary of Mamit District, Mizoram and most of their kidnap victims are Mizos and non-Mizos working in this border area.

 Some of the sensational kidnapping cases during the last 2(two) years in this area are as under:
