****Points relating to agenda proposed to be discussed during Directional Level co-ordination meeting of LIA (Lead Intelligence Agency) with reference to No. G/OPS-I/LIA/M&C-Ftr/2012/568-604 Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, HQ Inspector General, M&C Frontier, BSF (GENERAL BRANCH).****

****i)** The security scenario of the western part of Mizoram bordering with Bangladesh is comparatively peaceful. However, due to the frequent incidence of kidnappings/abduction occurred in the border areas because of the porousness of the Indo-Bangladesh border required more attention. The border between Mizoram and Bangladesh, especially Mamit District side of Mizoram and Bangladesh, deserves special attention due the current Dampa Wildlife Sanctuary abduction case in which 5 (five) persons have been recently abducted by NLFT. In this regard, border outposts of Mizoram IR Bn. have been intimated to stay on high alert. The security condition of the said areas is being kept under constant watch.**

**iv) Trans-border crimes and illegal movement**:

 On 6.6.2011, two employees of ABCI had been abducted by Assam based militant group named UDLA from ABCI camp near Meidum village, Kolasib district. The gang with the abductees left the camp by using the company's vehicle. Hence, Bairabi PS C/No.7/11 dt.6.6.11 u/s 365/386/395/34 IPC r/w 25(1B) (b) Arms Act had been registered.

 The hostages were rescued on 16.6.2011 after a firefight between Mizoram Police Joint Operation Team of CID (SB) and 1st IR Bn. RAF and the armed gang at the outskirt of Banglabasha village of Hailakandi district of Assam. After an encounter which lasted for about 30 minutes, the so-called UDLA fled towards the jungle leaving the two hostages behind. The commander of the group, before fleeing, shot at the right abdomen of one of the hostages, namely Premlal Dhiman, Project Manager, ABCI causing serious injury and the abductees were rescued safely. Neither the Police nor the armed group sustained any injury because of the encounter. On 26.10.2012, two of the accused persons suspected to be involved in the said abduction case namely, S/S President Doinaram Reang and S/S Pte. Zohmangaiha were arrested who admitted their involvement during interrogation.

 On 25.3.2012, 6 (six) employees of ABCI were abducted by about 20 cadres of NLFT militant outfit, who were having permanent hideout inside Bangladesh. The incident took place at a small ABCI designated camp called Lamba Sora located in between New Sachan and Mauzam, Lunglei district and the place of occurrence was not far away from Indo-Bangladesh border. The abductors took the hostages to the nearby Tarunpara village, Rangamati district, Bangladesh. The motive behind the abduction as claimed by NLFT was irregular payment of the so-called taxes imposed to be paid by the company to the outfit. The abductors plainly asserted that any attempt to launch rescue operation would invite instant killing of all hostages without hesitation.

The hostages were released on 30.4.2012 after 35 days long captivity inside Bangladesh. The hostages after their release reached BSF camp at Rajivnagar (Tuipuibari-II), Mamit district. Hence, Tlabung PS C/No.3/12 Dt. 30.3.2012 u/s 363/395 IPC r/w 25(1B) (a) Arms Act had been registered.

Two of the abductors were wearing jungle camouflage uniform and armed with carbine while the rest three were in civil dress and carried sticks. The abductors took away teak royalty documents/permits along with cash amounting Rs.30, 000/- and left towards Bangladesh border through the jungle. The abductors demanded payment of ransom money of Rs.15 lakhs each for the release of the hostages. Accordingly, W.Phaileng PS C/No.36/12 dt.26.11.12 u/s 364(A)/171/34 IPC r/w 25(1A) Arms Act had been registered. Further, information received stated that the three abductees Bengali Teak (timber) traders abducted by the combined group of NLFT and BNCT on 25.11.2012 from Tuipuibari-II were held at NLFT camp known as “Hnahbok Camp” located inside Kasalong forest west of Zopui village in Sazek hills of Bangladesh. It is learnt that families of the abductees were last contacted on 02.12.2012 through mobile phone by the abductors urging them to immediately pay up their ransom demand of Rs 30 lakhs. However, the abductees were released on 12.12.2012 after their families reportedly had paid Rs. 9 lakhs of ransom money to the kidnappers.

**v) Jehadi/Muslim fundamentalist activities:**

 There has been no report on the activities of Muslim fundamentalist in the State of Mizoram.

**vi) Miscellaneous/ Any other issues**:

****a)** The Hmar People's Convention ‘Democratic’ (HPC ‘D’), a Manipur based militant outfit is also a matter of concern since it has indulged in felonious activities such as forced collection of money from village authorities, Government employees and Contractors within their demand area which comprises over 30 villages in the northern part of the state. The HPC ‘D’ issued diktat to boycott the Village Council Election held in February 2012 and as such, 15 Village Councils within its demand area dared not conduct VC election. Moreover, the HPC ‘D’ had also dissolved as many as 37 Branches of YMA within its demand area. All these activities had drawn the attention of the Government resulting in the arrest of 3 (three) top leaders viz. H.Zosangbera, Chairman at IGI Airport, New Delhi on 17.7.2012 and two armed wing leaders S/S Army Chief Ropuia and S/S Dy. Army Chief Biaknunga at Silchar Airport on 10.6.2012.**

 On 21.11.2012, S/S Army Chief Ropuia was released on bail on medical ground. S/S Chairman H.Zosangbera and S/S Dy. Army Chief Biaknunga also released on bail on 6.2.2013.

 Another input received indicated that HPC (D) had demanded 50 lakhs from NEEPCO, which are currently undertaking construction of Tuirial Hydel Project, located within Hmar dominated area of Mizoram bordering Assam. They had set Dt.06.12.12 as the last date for payment of their demand. The HPC (D) had threatened to bomb outlet/inlet mechanism located inside the canal of the currently constructed Tuirial Hydel Project. Tuirial Hydel Project is located under Kolasib District near Assam border about 10 kms from Saipum village. In this connection, it was also reported that on 4.12.12 @ 12:15pm a group of about 10 persons, with arms, who were suspected to be members of HPC ‘D’ visited Dam site of Tuirial Hydel Project. They reportedly called up one engineer known as Ravi informing him that the demand they had made earlier had to be fulfilled within three days. In this connection, enquiry had been conducted by the SDPO, Vairengte to verify the authenticity of the information.

 The first round of Peace Talk between Government of Mizoram and HPC (D) was held on 31.1.2013 in Aizawl in which Suspension of Operation (SoO) was signed for the duration of six months w.e.f. 31.1.2013.

****b)**  The BNA (so called Bru National Army) with a strength of around 20 cadres having two sophisticated weapons may also be worth mentioning here that on 15.7.2012, Lalthazuala was arrested at the border of Tripura-Assam on his way to Hmarkhawlian to meet with leaders of HPC (D) to chalk out covert sabotage plan of attack against the State of Mizoram. In this connection, Aizawl PS C/No.322 dt.13.7.2012 u/s 121A/34 IPC had been registered.**
