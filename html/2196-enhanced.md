****Subject: Sending of Enquiry Report.****

**Sir,**

****With reference to your letter No.PHQ/OPS-1/2010/293 dt. 24.2.2011, I am sending the enquiry report on the activities of Chin Sumdawng Association as under for your information and necessary action.****

**The Chin Sumdawng Association was formed in September, 2007 and the present leaders are:-**

****

**1) President - C. Thangzauva, Zephai, Myanmar**

**2) Vice President - KT. Hramawh, Thlantlang, Myanmar**

**3) Secretary - C. Chunglianhum, Falam, Myanmar**

**4) Treasurer - HC. Chunglian, Thlantlang, Myanmar**

**5) Adviser - Rothlamuana, Tahan, Myanmar**

**All of them are now staying in Saiha. There are about 30(thirty) members in Saiha. According to C. Thangzauva, President, CSA, their main objective is to construct shorter Indo-Myanmar border road for traders that will run from Saisih(near Sangau) to Tiau khua, Myanmar and the work had already been started in March/April 2010. C. Thangzauva said that money for the said project was received from Myanmarese living in USA, Australia and Malaysia. He also said that the amount of money donated by those Myanmarese from abroad was about ` 20 lakhs. He further stated the other reason for construction of the road was that Indo-Myanmar border trade at Champhai is too far from Saiha and Lawngtlai and traders have to pay heavy taxes(i.e. at three check posts). It may also be mentioned that the President of Chin Sumdawng Association, C. Thangzauva is having shop at Saiha Bazar.**
