<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The overall security situation in Mizoram state by and large is peaceful. However, communities represented by the Hmar People Convention (Democratic) and Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram representing the Bru communities have been indulging in criminal activities apart from the various militant groups from neighbouring states and foreign countries such as Myanmar and Bangladesh are taking advantage of the peaceful status of Mizoram and thereby frequently indulge in subversive activities and pose a threat to the people living in the Inter-State and International border areas. The recent glaring example felt in the Inter-State and International border areas recently was HPC-D, a Manipur based militant group of Hmar community who threatened the electorates of Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) area by way of giving diktat and also the kidnapping of 5 Forest Muster Roll workers and 3 Gautam Construction Company&nbsp; workers at the Indo-Bangla border by Tripura based militant groups, i.e. NLFT &amp; Bru militant group.</span></span></p>

The total number of female voters is 3,49,506 and total&nbsp; number of male voters is 3,36,799. Out of 1126 Polling Stations, 6 polling stations are identified as Most Critical, 84 polling stations are Critical, and 1036 polling stations are identified as Normal polling stations.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mamit District: </strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Underground groups such as Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram (BNDLFM), Bru National Army (BNA), Bru Liberation Army (BLA) and National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) have intensified their activities within the District since 2008. These underground groups have particularly been involved in Abduction/Kidnapping/Extortion cases in all the three assembly constituencies viz Hachhek, Dampa and Mamit within Mamit District during the last 4-5 years. &nbsp;The latest being the recent abduction of 5 Forest Muster Roll workers and 3 Gautam Construction Company workers in 2013 at the Indo-Bangla border by Tripura based militant groups, i.e. NLFT &amp; Bru militant group.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bru/Reang comprises a sizeable portion of the population of Mamit district. Bru refuges electors are susceptible in the context of election.&nbsp; Despite sincere and dedicated efforts made by Government of Mizoram, the reluctance of Bru refugees especially the so-called Mizoram Bru Displaced People&#39;s Forum (MBDPF) leaders and uprising of numerous armed groups among the Bru youths derailed the Bru repatriation processes from time to time and as a result a few families of Bru refugees have so far been repatriated and resettled in Mizoram State. The Government of Mizoram is determined to repatriate Bru refugees from six Relief Camps of Tripura to Mizoram and the repatriation process will start from 30th September 2013. Even so, it may still be necessary to conduct special polling provisions in the Bru Relief camps inside Tripura as was practiced in the earlier elections.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overall Mamit District on election security perspective is relatively peaceful as no poll related violence is reported during the last general election. However, the recent abduction/kidnapping/extortion cases reported especially on the western side of the district bordering Bangladesh and Tripura coupled with the presence of anti-repatriation elements amongst Bru electors warranted some of the polling stations within the three constituencies of Mamit district to be declared as &nbsp;critical in the context of election.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Kolasib District:</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">During the last 4-5 years, the Hmar People&rsquo;s Convention (Democrats) had indulged in intimidation /extortion activities within Kolasib District. In the early part of 2012, HPC (D) had served/issued a diktat for dissolution of YMA Branches to different villages and also served extortion notice to different Village councils especially within Serlui constituency.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Village council polls in two villages i.e Saiphai and Saipum under Kolasib District could not be held as per schedule on February 23, 2012 due to law and order situation and the village council terms were extended in the two villages. While the state election commission tried to conduct elections again in October, 2012, no one filed papers despite three-time postponement of the last date for filing nominations due to threat induced by the HPC(D) to all political party leaders in the area to boycott the village council polls.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Kolasib District as stated above has Hmar dominated villages especially in Serlui constituency, causing the Hmar People&rsquo;s Convention (Democratic) to have political influence on the electorate in some villages. The other two constituencies namely Tuirial and Kolasib by and large are calm, peaceful and no pre-poll, poll and post-poll related violence is reported during the last general election.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aizawl District:</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">In Aizawl District, two constituencies namely Tuivawl and Chalfilh are affected by the activities of HPC (D).&nbsp; During the early part of 2012, HPC (D) had served /issued a diktat for dissolution of YMA Branches to different villages and also serve extortion notice to different Village councils especially within Tuivawl and Chalfilh constituencies.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Village council polls in 13 villages under Aizawl District could not be held on February 23, 2012 due to law and order situation and extended the village council terms in the area. While the state election commission tried to conduct elections again in October, 2012, no one filed nomination papers despite three-time postponement of last date for filing nominations due to threat induced by the HPC(D) to all political party leaders in the area to boycott the village council polls.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">In light of the above circumstances, it can be inferred that except Tuivawl and Chalfilh constituencies, all the remaining constituencies within Aizawl District are comparatively free from any serious electoral offences like intimidation, etc.. during the last 4-5 years.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Champhai District:</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) of Manipur and Chin National Front (CNF) of Myanmar though reportedly having low activities&nbsp; in the area could have political influence in some villages under Lengteng, East Tuipui, Champhai North, Champhai South constituencies. &nbsp;In June 2004, ZRA militants alleged that the Mizo National Front (MNF) government in Mizoram partially paid the group for campaigning for its candidates in Champhai constituency. In East Tuipui constituency, five (5) polling stations namely: Vaphai-I, &nbsp;Vaphai-II, Saikhumphai, Farkawn-I and Farkawn-II are identified as most critical due to t<span style="color:black">he incident at Saikhumphai on </span>29.4.2013 and the subsequent <span style="color:black">major law and order problem in regard to the question of illegal settlement of Saikhumphai settlers and the persistent friction between Farkawn and Vaphai. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">In short, it can be concluded that due to the Saikhumphai fallout, some of the polling stations are critical owing to their closeness to Myanmar border and possible influence from Myanmar based-underground groups like CNF, ZRA. However, the overall security threats perception of the remaining part of the Champhai District on election issue is relatively peaceful.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serchhip &nbsp;District:</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Out of the three constituencies within the District only Hrangturzo constituency could have potential political threats in two polling stations namely Sailulak and Lungkawlh from Chin National Front of . The security situation of the district is by and large peaceful.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lunglei &nbsp;District:</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><span style="color:black">Some villages falling under two constituencies namely Thorang and West Tuipui which are located on the Bangladesh international border could have potential threats to the election from some underground groups i.e NLFT, JSS, UDPF having bases inside Bangladesh. </span>In general, the record shows that pre-poll, poll and post poll violence are not reported during the last election in Lunglei District. Therefore, no serious election security threats are perceived till today in Lunglei District. However, any possible influences of Bangladesh based-underground groups need to be closely watched especially on the area bordering Bangladesh side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawngtlai&nbsp; District:</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Lawngtlai district is located in the south-western most part of Mizoram having international boundaries with Bangladesh to the west and Myanmar to the south. Possible political influence of Bangladesh based-underground groups such as: NLFT, JSS (Jana Sanghati Samity) and UPDF (United People&rsquo;s Democratic Front) cannot be ruled out though such imminent threats are not perceived at the moment. During the last general election no poll related violence is reported within the district.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saiha &nbsp;District:</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:48px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The district is bounded on the north and northwest by Lunglei District on the west by Lawngtlai District and on the south and east by Myanmar. Due to its nearness to international border with Bangladesh and presence of many insurgent outfits like Mara People Army (MPA), CNA, NSCN (IM) and JSS in this area, any indulgence of such outfits in commission of electoral offences like intimidation, booth capturing, impersonation, etc.. cannot be rule out though such imminent threats are not perceived at the moment. The past general election record within the district shows that no pre-poll, poll and post-poll violence are reported in the district.</span></span></p>
