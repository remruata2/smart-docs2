****No funds released by Treasury:** Due to the deteriorating financial condition faced by the state, two of the biggest Treasuries in Mizoram -Aizawl South and Aizawl North Treasuries have ceased releasing of their funds. However, the treasuries themselves have not yet been closed at the moment.**

 As per instructions from Central Government, Finance Department instructed the Treasuries to released all funds received as Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) to the state nodal agencies (SNA). The CSS funds released during the past few weeks by the treasuries amounted to Rs. 570 crores.

 At the same time, as a considerable amount of CSS funds have been diverted by the state for other purposes, the funds in the account of Mizoram state are not sufficient to meet the required amount of CSS to be released. This resulted in the treasuries of Mizoram in lacking funds to be released for other purposes.
