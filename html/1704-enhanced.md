No. MSB/CB/B-85/    Dated Aizawl the July, 2015.

To,

  The Asst. Inspector General of Police-I

  Mizoram, Aizawl.

Subj. : Regarding smuggling and movement of illegal arms and ammunitions.

Ref. :  No. CB/PHQ/AA/12/63 dt. 8.7.2015.

Sir,

  Apropos the above, I am to state that no detail records of cases registered regarding smuggling and movement of illegal arms and ammunitions are being maintained by this unit so as to fill up the required format.

  It is, therefore, suggested that all the district SsP who are supposed to keep all the requisite informations in this regard may be asked and our inability to comply with the requirement is regretted.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**

Superintendent of Police

CID(SB), Mizoram, Aizawl.
