Subj :-  Threat perception assessment - reg.

Ref : No.SEC/R-40/2016/71 Dt. 24.4.2020

Sir,

 In compliance to your letter no. and subject mentioned above, I am forwarding herewith report on assessment of threat perceptions which are as under :

 At present, the two dignitaries namely, Pu Lalrinliana Sailo and Pu Lalchhandama Ralte do not have direct or indirect threat and they do not receive intimidation of any kind from anyone or any group. Their entitlement of no. of PSOs is 2(two) PSOs each. At the same time, Pu Lalrinliana Sailo is having four PSOs, namely- Hav. Lalthuama Sailo, Hav. Ngursailova Sailo, C/ Lalhmuchhuaka, C/Calvin Lalnunpuia Ralte and D/Gr-III Eddie V.L.Awmpuia, who is acting as PSO.

 Since the two dignitaries are elected from HPCD's demand areas i.e. Chalfilh A/C (Pu Lalrinliana Sailo) and Tuivawl A/C (Pu Lalchhandama Ralte), unforeseen threat or intimidation can arise anytime whether politically motivated or personal concern. Moreover, it is not certain if HPCD or any other extremist group within or outside the state will continue to uphold peace with Mizoram State Government. Therefore, considering their conditions, which differs from other Ministers/MLAs, the present strength of PSOs for the two dignitaries is viewed as sufficient for the time being and that downsizing of PSOs may not be feasible for the two dignitaries in the present situations.

 Submitted for your kind information and necessary action, please 

  Yours faithfully,

** (K.LALREMSANGA)**
