****INTERNAL SECURITY WITH FOCUS ON INTELLIGENCE SHARING AND CO-ORDINATION FOR COMBATING TERRORISM/INSURGENCY AND POLICE REFORMS.****

****I.****Overview of State Security********

The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful. Although peaceful, Mizoram is surrounded by countries and states which are having many disturbances with respect to insurgency and terrorism.

 Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (The insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to the over two-decades armed conflict of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where around 104 Cadres and 12 Council Members of HPC(D) come to over ground at the ceremony.

 As for the North-Western region, the Bru insurgency has been contained to a great extend so much so that this insurgent Group has become more or less a group of Bandits without any definite demand or objectives.

**II. Intelligence sharing and co-ordination for combating terrorism/insurgency :**

A robust mechanism for intelligence sharing among the various States and Central agencies is in place in the country. The coordination mechanism for intelligence sharing at state–level that presently exist in Mizoram is highlighted as under:

**(a) Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC):**

Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC) was set up in Mizoram Police during May, 2011. It is one of the Centres amongst various Intelligence Agencies under Ministry of Home Affairs for effective sharing of intelligence input/report with other Central and State Agencies. Regular SMAC meetings of Nodal Officers of the State police, security forces, paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies deployed within the State of Mizoram are being conducted regularly at SIB Hqrs., Aizawl. During such meetings, intelligence inputs are shared and discussed with responders/State Police and often Law Enforcement Agencies for necessary follow up action.

The following nodal officers or their representatives regularly attended SMAC Meeting conducted by SIB, Aizawl under the supervision of Additional Deputy Director, SIB, Aizawl.

(xiii) OC, No.1, CT/IS-DET, ECCIU, Aizawl

In addition to SMAC Meeting, Intelligence inputs are being shared with various intelligence agencies all over India through Multi Agency Centre (MAC) Threat Management System.

**Suggestion to improve the System of SMAC in Mizoram:** 

Real time sharing of intelligence inputs through Threat Management System (TMS) with other intelligence agencies is hampered due to frequent disruption of connectivity (intranet) of the system. It is therefore suggested that suitable measures may be taken to plug such loophole.

**(b) Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA) Coordination/ Directional Meeting:**

Assam Rifle and Border Security Force (BSF) have regularly conducted LIA Coordination Meeting in Aizawl. LIA Directional Meeting is also regularly conducted by BSF in Silchar, Assam. During such meetings, intelligence inputs are shared and discussed with responders/State Police and often Law Enforcement Agencies for necessary follow up action. The LIA Coordination meeting is held under the chairmanship of DIG, 23rd Assam Rifle if LIA is conducted by Assam Rifle and DIG, Sector HQ BSF presided over the meeting if it was conducted by BSF.

In LIA Coordination Meeting held in Aizawl, Nodal Officers / or their representatives from the following Central and State agencies deployed within the state of Mizoram normally attended the meetings.

(i) SIB, Aizawl

(ii)  Deputy Commissioner, SB (GOI), Aizawl

**II. Police reforms :**

 

 The police are the first responders in the event of any terrorist attack or violence, and they are also the backbone of our intelligence, investigation and anti-corruption agencies. Thus, from the point of any angle - the security of the common man, the survival of democracy, maintaining the trajectory of economic progress or dealing with the major threats confronting the country - we have to have a reformed, restructured and revitalised police force.

There have been a number of commissions, both at the State and Central level - State Police Commissions, National Police Commission, Gore Committee, Ribeiro Committee, Padmanabhaiah Committee, Malimath Committee, to name only a few - which made recommendations for reforms, but received no more than cosmetic treatment at the hands of the government.

It is imperative to strengthen the manpower of Mizoram Police by filling up vacant posts by way of fresh recruitment at various ranks and files.

**III. Case for reimbursement of Security Related Expenditure :**

Mizoram is having approximately 404 kms and 318 kms porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively. There are 3 (three) Battalions of Assam Rifles deployed at the Indo-Myanmar border and 3 (three) Battalions of BSF deployed along Indo-Bangladesh border. In addition, Mizoram Police has separately deployed security personnel (IR Bn) along Indo-Bangla border and the expenditure incurred for performing such security duties were boned by the state government. The porous international borders served as an important route for IGs to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, etc across the borders of Mizoram.

 It is therefore suggested that some discretionary component may be introduced under Security Related Expenditure (SRE) by Central Government so that states of Mizoram could acts as effective layer behind Central Paramilitary Forces for safeguarding the territory of India.
