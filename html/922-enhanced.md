****REPORT ON ALLEGED MOVEMENT OF ARMS CONSIGNMENT BY ARAKAN ARMY (AA)****

Enquiry was conducted on a report received from Special Bureau, Govt. of India, Aizawl regarding alleged movement of huge consignment of Arms and Ammunitions by AA from Myanmar to Bangladesh via Mizoram and the following actions were taken:

1. **Contact with Tuisentlang Sources:** VCP and other prominent citizens of Tuisentlang as well as Police personnel deployed on duty were contacted. As per input, 2 (two) entry points from Myanmar into Mizoram were sealed and manned by VLFT and Police Personnel (2nd MAP Bn.) deployed to contain Covid-19. Sources contacted all stated that they have not heard of any movement of arms consignment or AA activities and no report on involvement of residents of Tuisentlang village for transportation of arms and ammunition.

It may however, be mentioned that during the concluding part of 2018, AA have established Camp at BedsuriTlang, which is located at 1 (one) km away from Tuisentlang at Indo-Myanmar border. The Camp was deserted with the appearance of Indian Army during the 1st quarter of 2019 and they have not been sighted or heard of since then.

1. **CNF/CAN:** Effort was made to ascertain the matter from contacts of Chin National Front/Army. As per input further received from their colleagues of Laiza village, Kachin State, there is no such report on movement of the above arms consignment. AA are reported to procure arms mainly from WAH insurgents of Shan State and that they have reportedly not engaged in any worthwhile activities due to Covid-19 pandemic.

1. **Arakan Army:** As per input received from reliable AA Intelligence Officer, AA have not venture outside their area of influence and have not moved any arms consignment due to their continuous fight with Myanmar Army coupled with outbreak of Covid-19.

It may be surmised from the above findings that the possibility of movement of huge consignment of arms and ammunitions via Indian soil appears to be unfeasible. At the same time, AA have the capability to move arms consignment to Bangladesh through Myanmar i.e., without entering into India. Another input suggests that instead of procurement of new arms and ammunitions, AA might have shifted/transported their present holdings of arms and ammunition from Myanmar to Bangladesh due to security reasons.

 Further enquiry into the matter will be conducted.
