****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/712

Dated: 20th September, 2019.

 In continuation of our DSI dated 17.9.2019, Item No. E(a). Regarding the current boundary issues between 2 (two) localities of Aizawl, viz. Chanmari and Zarkawt, information has been received that Chanmari Branch YMA intends to erect boundary pillar tomorrow, i.e. 21.9.2019 in the disputed Chanmari-Zarkawt boundary.

 In this connection, the Aizawl Municipal Corporation (AMC) Boundary Committee convened a meeting with Local Council Members of Chanmari and Zarkawt today, i.e. 20.9.2019 @ 11:00 a.m at AMC Office, Thuampui, Aizawl. In the meeting, Local Council Members of both the localities put forth their views and standpoints on the Chanmari-Zarkawt boundary. Whereas Chanmari Local Council leaders based their standpoint on the Mizoram Government Gazette of 1994, Zarkawt Local Council leaders stated that they are not aware of the Gazette and moreover could not agree to it since it was made without consulting them. The AMC Boundary Committee requested both the Local Council members to take necessary steps for diffusing the prevailing tension and to convene a joint meeting. It also asked the Local Council members of Chanmari to take necessary steps with Chanmari Branch YMA so as to cancel their intended erection of boundary pillar tomorrow, i.e. 21.9.2019. The AMC Boundary Committee is also learned to have requested the CYMA to take necessary steps for maintenance of peace and harmony between the two localities.

 Input received indicated that consequently, the Chanmari Branch YMA held its OB’s meeting which decided to convene a meeting of its Executive Members, Section Leaders and selected invitees tonight, i.e. 20.9.2019 @ 7:30 p.m at Chanmari YMA Hall to discuss about their course of action.

 As per information received, it is hoped that the meeting will bear positive outcome. Situation is under close watch.
