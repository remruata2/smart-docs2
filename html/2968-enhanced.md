****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/147

Dated: 4th March, 2019.

Information received indicated that there had been a movement of 3rd Bn. Assam Regiment and Assam Rifles towards Southern Lawngtlai District from around 14/15.02.2019 onwards. The movement could not go unnoticed by the general population and so there was a huge speculation spread among the public through social media which also caused panic in some quarters as there has been continued reports of sporadic fighting between Myanmar Army (MA) and the Arakan Army (AA) on the other side of the border since last year. The claim of the security forces has been that they are conducting a joint routine exercise in the area. There were also reports of restrictions of movement of the villagers in the area by the security forces. Therefore, on the verbal instruction of DIG(CID), Pu C. Lalengliana, Dy.SP (Field), CID(SB) was sent from Aizawl on 20.02.2019 to visit the area, the southern part of Lawngtlai District bordering Myanmar, and take stock of the situation.

As per the visit of Vathuampui and Hmawngbuchhuah area, located within Lawngtlai District during 21-28.2.2019, it was found that a joint exercise was conducted by Assam Rifles and Assam Regiment where 3rd Bn. Assam Regiment was covering Tuisentlang, Kawn khua and the areas around Parva under CADC. 29th Bn. Assam Rifles was covering Vathuampui, Tuichawngtlang and Ngunlinga Khua while 1st Assam Rifles covered Hmawngbuchhuah and its surrounding areas including Sabualtlang.

Advance check-posts were set up at the junction near 71 RDS Construction Company Camp in Kaladyne Multi Modal Transit Transport Project and at Zero Point near Bungtlang South village in LDP (Lawngtlai - Diltlang ‘S’ - Parva) road. Other check-posts were also set up at Saibawh junction and other villages close to the Myanmar border. Register is properly maintained at these check-posts recording every entry and exit. Vehicle registration number, driver's name and Driving Licence number, number of passengers commuting, destination, EPIC &amp; Aadhaar card of passengers are recorded in these areas.

It was found that the security personnel restricted movement towards the jungle in these areas. Information received indicated that the operation conducted against the Arakan Army by Myanmar Army is the main reason for imposing restriction of movement since the Indo-Myanmar international boundary is very close from these villages.

 In Vathuampui and its surrounding areas, people can move freely from one village to another. There was no report of problem relating to scarcity of food and other such necessities. Some families have not yet finished felling trees for their paddy cultivation which seemed to be their main problem. The security personnel also conducted Free Medical Camp for the villagers on 20.2.2019. Information received indicated that Bru residents of Kawn village, which is the nearest village from the boundary, were uneasy and confused about the sudden presence of army personnel with report that some families wanted to leave the village. Some of these villagers had cultivated land which fell within the area of Myanmar in the past years; but with the current situation, they were unable to cultivate these lands.

 Information received indicated that the people of these surrounding villages did not hear about any kind of operation being conducted by Myanmar Army against Arakan Army in the nearby border areas except during around the months of October and November in 2017.

 The personnel deployed in Vathuampui area conduct regular patrolling and it was also reported that temporary camps were also set up in the jungle.

__1st Bn. Assam Rifles from Lunglei were deployed in Hmawngbuchhuah and other surrounding villages like Dumzautlang, Tuidumzau, Laitlang, Zochachhuah, Sabualtlang etc. Movement of people is strictly checked and production of EPIC and Aadhaar cards was mandatory for the villagers to go outside their villages. Villagers are restricted from visiting the jungles and their cultivated lands. This restriction caused scarcity of food and other vegetables in these villages. Information received indicated restriction was imposed on the people from leaving their houses during night time in Hmawngbuchhuah village. Information was also received that the Assam Rifles even conducted roll call of the villagers in Sabualtlang.

__Information received indicated that the people residing in these areas heard the sound of gun shots supposedly being fired between Myanmar Army and Arakan Army during the past one or two months near Zochachhuah border but such kind of sounds had not been heard recently.

__Since the means of livelihood for these villages was paddy cultivation and collection of vegetables, the possibility of scarcity of food for the villagers of these areas was considered if the present condition had persisted.

 Information had been received that members of MJA from Lunglei, Siaha and Lawngtlai Districts intended to visit these villages which are close to the border in the coming week.

 The following were found while visiting the area :-

1. Conduct of this kind of exercise is a regular routine for the Army and the area is selected for conducting the same this year.
2. Some officers stated that one of the purposes of their deployment was for the security of the civilians in these areas since there was a report of Myanmar Army intending to conduct an operation against Arakan Army within their territory which was just on the other side of the international boundary.
3. Army officers further stated that they were not intending to pose a threat to the Arakan Army instead would persuade them to surrender themselves to join a normal life and would be handed over to civil Police for further necessary actions, even if they were found.

Pu Amit Goel, IPS, SP, Lawngtlai visited Zochachhuah village on 02.03.2019 and held a meeting with the VC members and leaders of NGO’s which was also attended by Maj. Akash of 1st Assam Rifles. The villagers presented the problems they were facing due to the restriction of movement imposed by the para-military force like the unfinished clearing of

jungle for jhum cultivation by 30 out of 84 families, dependence on sprouting leaves of fruit plants due to inability to gather vegetables, exhausting stock of rice grains and inability to visit ailing families and friends in neighbouring villages. After due deliberation, it was decided that there will be no restriction on movement of villagers within Indian territory provided they carry proof of identity such as EPIC, Aadhar card, etc.
 Report received on 03.03.2019 indicated that the Assam Regiment deployed around Parva village had appeared to be making preparation for withdrawal from their area of exercise while those in Tuisentlang area had withdrawn. Assam Rifles deployed around Vathuampui area had also been reportedly withdrawing from the area. However, there was still report of gunshot within Myanmar side which could be heard from Laitlang village yesterday morning, i.e. 03.03.2019 and Assam Rifles were reported to be still stationed in the area, i.e. Hmawngbuchhuah area.
