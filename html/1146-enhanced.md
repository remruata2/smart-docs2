****REASON FOR ADDITIONAL HYPERSENSITIVE POLLING STATION****

 In 2008, 7 (seven) polling stations are declared hypersensitive and the 7 (seven) polling stations are still put under hypersensitive position. 6 (six) more polling stations of Champhai District such as Farkawn 'N', Farkawn 'S', Vaphai 'E', Vaphai 'W' and Saikhumphai and one more Polling Station, i.e. Saiphai-II are the new addition in view of the persistent friction on illegal settlement of Saikhumphai village under Vaphai village area which is also a serious issue between Farkawn and Vaphai villages.

**ADDITIONAL SENSITIVE POLLING STATION**

 In 2008, 66 (sixty six) polling stations are declared sensitive and additional 14 (fourteen) polling stations are to be added mainly due to newly created polling stations in the already sensitive villages like Suangpuilawn, Phuaibuang, Sakawrdai, Khawlian, Rajivnagar, Silsury and Hnahva. Besides, polling stations like Lungpuk, Siasih, Saihapui V, Pangbalkawn, Bukvannei, Meidum, Chiahpui and Lungphunlian are added due to the frequent activities of militant outfits and nearness to the international border.
