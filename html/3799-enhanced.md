****REGIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIES CONFERENCE - 2021****

****FOR NORTH EAST****

**I. CHINESE ACTIVITIES IN THE NORTH EAST**

 Apart from the State of Arunachal Pradesh, no other States of the North East shares International border with China. However, due to the recent Military Coup of Myanmar and the subsequent Civil Disobedience Movement organised in protest against it, the following points may be considered :

**(1)** As China could not yet condemn or criticized the Military takeover of Myanmar, the activities of Chinese agents inside Myanmar, right up to the bordering States of North East India should be monitored.

**(2)** Presently, Myanmar is on the brink of Civil War as neither the military nor the protestors are trying to back down. As such, if the situation in Myanmar escalate like Syria as a result of ethnic Burmese civilian taking arms against the military, the possibilities of the intervention of China militarily in Myanmar in support of military cannot be ruled out, which, undoubtedly, would increase the influx of refugees to the bordering North East Indian States.

****(3)** If there is a direct Chinese military involvement in Myanmar as a result of the prevailing situation, State governments of the bordering North East States along with the border guarding forces have to be beefed up along the porous Indo-Myanmar borders.**

**II. EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF INDO-MYANMAR BORDER**

****(1)**According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of International border with Myanmar along which are scattered around 30 - 40 small villages in Mizoram side. These International border posts with Myanmar are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.**

**(2)** Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be a great assets for the government and the border guard alike.

**(3)** Having a low profile close ties with ethnic leaders of Chin Hills and Arakan-Rakhine States may also be invaluable for sharing cross-border information.

**(4)** The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime(FMR) between India and Myanmar allows Myanmarese nationals to enter up to 16 kms. into Mizoram Territory without any Visa restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the border of Mizoram and Myanmar.
