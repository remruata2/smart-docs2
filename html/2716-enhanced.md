****BRU REFUGEES / BRU REPATRIATION****

**I.** An Executive Committee Meeting of Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Coordination Committee (MBDPCC) was held on 13.8.2018 at Naisingpara, Tripura. The meeting was chaired by Pu T. Laldingliana, President, MBDPCC and the following resolutions were passed by the meeting :-

i)  MBDPCC strongly condemned the Government of Mizoram for allowing NGOs to block Election officials from conducting E/Roll Revision at Refugee Camps in Tripura. MBDPCC alleged the Government of Mizoram of instigating the communal based NGOs in derailing the process of E/Roll Revision.

ii) MBDPCC strongly resolved to organise a long march from Kanhmun to Zawlnuam on or before 22.8.2018 in protest against the attitude of Government of Mizoram towards the Bru refugees.

****II.**  As per information received, re-identification of Mizoram Brus in the 6 (six) Refugee Camps in Tripura, viz. Kaiskau, Khakchangpara, Hamsapara, Hazacherra, Asapara and Naisingpara; who were willing to return to Mizoram was conducted from 16.8.2018 to 18.8.2018. 425 families reportedly submitted their willingness to return to Mizoram while 90 families who claimed to be from Mizoram but were not in the Identification List of 2016 and E/Roll of Mizoram reported themselves for identification. After conclusion of the re-identification process for repatriation, officials representing the 3 districts of Kolasib, Lunglei and Mamit proceeded towards Mamit on the evening of 18.8.2018. In the meantime, NGO Coordination Committee had the notion that several number of Form-6 for Summary E/Roll Revision was also collected by these officials while conducting re-identification for repatriation. These returning officials were stopped and checked by Langkaih and Taitesena Group YMA at Zawlnuam area and they were later joined by NGOCC members from CYMA, MZP and MSU headed by Pu R. Lalngheta, Vice President, CYMA who came from Aizawl. No documents relating to Summary E/Roll Revision was found by the NGOCC in the possession of these officials conducting re-identification.**

 It has been reported that Mizoram Bru Displaced People's Coordination Committee (MBDPCC) leaders headed by their President, T. Laldingliana visited the 3 Bru Refugee Camps at Langkaih Area (namely Kaiskau, Hamsapara and Khakchangpara) on 17.8.2018. These MBDPCC leaders campaigned against returning to Mizoram if their additional demands after the signing of the 'Four Corner Agreement' were not met. They also submitted a request for permission to conduct mass rally on 22.08.2018 at Kanhmun to SP, Mamit through OC, Kanhmun PS which was rejected. Reports indicated that the Centre is willing to relax the conditions in the ‘Four Corner Agreement’ for the repatriation of Bru refugees to Mizoram although the extent of the relaxation is not certain at present.

 Information has been received that Equal Package Demand Committee (EPDC) submitted a representation to Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for those who had returned to Mizoram earlier and those who will be returning to Mizoram on the 'Four Corner Agreement'. They also intended to organise a Sit-in demonstration at Kanhmun on 22.8.2018 to press their demand.

 Information has been received that Mizoram Bru Displaced People's Forum (MBDPF) submitted their report on the Re-verification/Re-identification of Bru families conducted on 16-18.8.2018 to the Ministry of Home Affairs today, i.e. 20.8.2018. The report :-

i)  Accused the Government of Mizoram (GOM) of attempting to segregate the Mizoram Bru Refugees between those 'willing' and 'unwilling' to return to Mizoram while claiming that everyone was willing to return after completion of necessary documentations.

ii) Claimed that officials of GOM came for collection of names of only those who are willing to be repatriated on 25.8.2018 while they thought that repatriation will start only after completion of works by the GOI, GOT and GOM.

iii) Accused that the officials intended to identify the left out families from identification held in November 2016 after the completion of the identified families while they claimed that the left out families were to be identified first as per the Agreement.

iv) Accused the officials of refusing to take spot decisions on new-borns or bifurcation of families and to give out 'identification slip'/'acknowledgement slip' to the identified families and 'verification slip' to the left out families who reported themselves.

v) Claimed that the inmates were busy with getting necessary requirement for documentary proof, etc. for the repatriation and when they were all willing to turn up for the Re-identification on 18.8.2018, the officials of GOM closed the process at 11:50 a.m and left for Kanchanpur. They also claimed that the leaders of MBDPF met Tripura officials to inform them that the inmates were willing to turn up for verification and also requested the Tripura officials to inform the officials of Mizoram to conduct verification programme.

**III.** Information has been received that Mizoram Bru Displaced People's Co-ordination Committee (MBDPCC) submitted a letter to the Chief Minister of Tripura on 22.8.2018 in which they requested the Hon'ble Chief Minister to take necessary action so that the following points can be implemented in connection with the on-going repatriation process of Mizoram Brus :-

i) Formation of Area Development Council for the Brus of Mizoram.

ii) Allotment of 5 Hectares of land to each repatriated family.

iii) To set up cluster/model villages with no less than 500 families.

iv) To conduct Electoral Roll Revision at Bru camps before starting  repatriation.

v) Cash assistance be given to Bru families at the camps before starting repatriation.

vi) Granting of general amnesty to all the Internally Displaced People concerning the states of Mizoram and Tripura.

vii)Identification of approximately 1,000 remaining left out Bru families be  conducted before repatriation.

**IV.** Information has been received on dt. 3.9.2018 that the Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Coordination Committee (MBDPCC), who are opposed to the on-going Bru refugee repatriation, in an effort to derail the repatriation process are planning to seek help and support from an unspecified Bru underground element possibly the Assam-based United Democratic Liberation Front/Army (UDLF or UDLA) with the motive to instill fear in the minds of the refugees thereby sabotaging the on-going repatriation process. The conspiracy appeared to have been prompted by the fear, on the part of the MBDPCC, of losing faith amongst the refugees as many have started submitting their willingness to return to Mizoram as per the road map chalked out in the recently signed Four-Corner Agreement signed by the Government of India, Government of Tripura, Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum (MBDPF) and Government of Mizoram.

 Though the input is yet to be confirmed/corroborated, the threat may either come in a form of a strong _diktat_issued in the name of any underground element directed at the refugees in general, or by creating a situation which could provoke a retaliatory action from the Mizo people which they can use as a leverage to continue their stay in the Bru camps while laying blame on the Mizo people.

 The following persons are alleged to have been behind the conspiracy :-

 T. Laldingliana, President, MBDPCC, Hazacherra Refugee Camp

 T. Malsawma, Treasurer, MBDPCC, Hamsapara Refugee Camp.

 Vanlalliana, Naisingpara Refugee Camp. He is the one who had instigated the MBDPCC leaders and also known to have link with UDLF/UDLA.

 In light of the above information, it is suggested that the Tripura-Mizoram border may be actively patrolled by security forces to prevent subversive elements from entering Mizoram. Moreover, it is suggested that a special media coverage be given when the 3 Bru families that returned recently are handed over their rehabilitation packages to facilitate instilling the desire to return to Mizoram in the mind of the remaining Brus after they have seen the benefits received by them.

**V.**NGO Co-ordination Committee (CYMA, MUP, MHIP, MZP, MSU) held a meeting on 4.9.2018 in which they expressed their optimism for the success of Repatriation of the Bru Refugees from Tripura as per the Four Corner Agreement signed between Central Government, Government of Mizoram, Government of Tripura and Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples' Forum (MBDPF). Leaders of NGO Co-ordination Committee expressed serious concern over Deputy Commissioner, Mamit conducting Electoral Roll Revision at Tripura Transit Camp. NGO Coordination Committee highlighted that they have previously urged the concerned officials not to conduct election related matters outside Mizoram before the completion of the repatriation process. In this regard, NGO Co-ordination Committee alleged Shri. Bhupesh Chaudhary, Deputy Commissioner, Mamit of disrespecting the sentiments of NGO Co-ordination Committee and the Mizo public in general and urged Shri. Bhupesh Chaudhary to leave Mizoram. NGO Co-ordination Committee also urged the Election Commission of India to fulfill its commitment made in 2014 for taking necessary initiatives to stop polling at Bru Refugee Camps at Tripura. A Press Note is issued in this regard.

ii) ‘The YMA and MZP boycotted the casting of vote from the Brus in 1999 Lok Sabha Election whereas the special polling booth was arranged at Kanhmun village inside Mizoram.’

iii) ‘Tlawngthlang Joint YMA and MZP organised mass rally on 16.9.2003 against enumeration of names of Brus in the Electoral Rolls.’

 **Information has been received that Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement (MBIDM) submitted a Memorandum to the Hon'ble Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh today, i.e. 10.9.2018 in which they demanded the creation of Bru Autonomous District Council in Mizoram.**

****XII.** **Input received indicated that MBDPF leaders, in a bid to sabotage the on-going repatriation process, are secretly passing information about E/Roll Revision to certain elements with an intention thereby to indirectly instigate activists of NGOs, MZP, MSU, etc. to way lay the officials carrying the documents en-route from Kanchanpur to Mamit. Input also indicated that there is a possibility that these elements in collusion with the Bru leaders might also intercept officials of the E/Roll Revision with suspicion falling the Mizos due to their open opposition of the E/Roll Revision at Bru Camps in Tripura. These events will most likely disrupt the election process thereby further forcing an issue which could result in undue delay to the schedule of holding the Mizoram State Assembly Election and at the same time, providing an exceptional leverage for the Bru leaders to reject the repatriation process agreed in the Quadri-lateral Agreement**.**
