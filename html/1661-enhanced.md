5.9.2011 Information has been received that the HPC(D) has agreed to join the SoO group under KNO, and are sever its membership from the UPF. The information received suggests that the HPC(D) President Lalhmingthang Sanate had already signed an agreement with the KNO President P.S Haokip at the secret meeting at Tuibuang, Churachandpur on 31st August 2011.

 The HPC(D) President appeared to have been convinced that joining the KNO in demand for a statehood out of Manipur would be the only option for their survival under SoO agreement. Further input received also suggest that the agreement(to join the KNO) might include a status under the sixth schedule for the Hmars in Tipaimukh area.

8.9.2011 As per the information received, the recent peace rally organised in the name of all party at Sakawrdai, Saiphai and Suangpuilawn on 25.8.11 was sponsored by HPC(D), an amount of Rs.50,000/- sanctioned by the HPC(D) was received by Thanglianchhunga of Sakawrdai from H.Zosangbera, Gen.Secy a few days before the rally.

 While the rally ws intended to revive talks between the Govt. of Mizoram and HPC(D), intelligence input received suggests that another motive behind sponsoring the rally was to show their control over the entire people within their demand area and that the HPC(D) have political influence over the 3 legislative constituencies within their demand area i.e. Serlui, Tuivawl and Chalfilh constituencies.

14.9.2011 Input received stated that the HPC(D) council meeting held on 13.9.11 at an undisclosed location in Churachandpur discussed about HPC(D) joining KNO group as per green signal given by their President Lalhmingthang Sanate. After lengthy deliberation and hot debate on the topic, the council meeting decided not to join KNO and even persuaded their President to withdraw his earlier decision which the President reportedly agreed.

3.10.2011 Executive council emergency meeting of HPC(D) held on 29.9.11 has impeached its President Lalhmingthang Sanate for signing a Deed of Agreement to join the KNO camp without consulting the HPC(D) Executive Council, the highest policy maker of the HPC(D) organisation and regarded his action as a betrayal of Hmar cause.

 A press statement issued in this regard issued on 30.9.2011 warned their deposed President not to indulge himself in any activities in the name of HPC(D) or Hmar community and also to accept his mistakes as well as impeachment from the presidenship.

 Press statement enclosed in _Annexure-XVI_.

27.10.2011 Impeachment of its president had resulted in both the factions trying to take control of their hidden weapons in Manipur as well as in Hmar demanded areas of N.C. Hills, Assam. A group (7) loyal to Lalhmingthanga Sanate had taken out 8 nos. of weapons hidden in the jungle, north of Haflong today i.e 27.10.2011 and headed for a location known as Khuanglung village about 3 hours journey on foot north of Haflong.The group is likely to move towards Haflong after burying the weapons and would follow jungle routes to avoid rival group led by Roger S/S PRO present in the area who are also trying to take control of the hidden weapons.

 It may be recalled that Biaknunga S/S Dy. Chief of Army had taken control of weapons in Vangai Hills earlier during 2nd week of October, 2011.

8.11.2011 Deposed HPC(D) President Lalhmingthanga Sanate is now hiding in Saikot and adjoining Khawpuibung area in Churachanpur, in a bid to regroup and to counter his rival factions. Lalhmingthanga Sanate has chosen this area as base Hqrs. believing that he has majority public support, and obviously as the jungle within the vicinity provides safe sanctuary in the event of possible army patrol in the area. Lalhmingthanga Sanate group had so far procured about 10-15 weapons of different type including 1(one) lethode with 9(nine) nos. of ammunitions out of which 9(nine) weapons are presently kept hidden in Mualhoi, NC.Hills.

 Input suggests that armed confrontation between the two rival factions of HPC(D) could not be ruled out in the near future despite intervention by Hmar NGO and Church leaders as both the factions focus on Manipur State Legislative Assembly election which is due in February, 2012.

8.11.2011 It was learnt that the HPC(D) Ropuia Faction has instructed S/S Comdr.El-a i/c of designated camp to desist Oil Company from entering Tipaimukh/Vangai area for oil exploration.

20.12.2011 The two rival factions of HPC(D) are having a dispute over fund collection from contractors under Vodafone company who are doing OFC(Optical Fiber Cable) laying works between Ratu and New Vervek on Tipaimukh road. Input suggests that Lalhmingthanga's faction may infiltrate into Mizoram during January 2012 to physically intimidate contractors to divert some 3/4 % out of the estimated amount for a 3 kilometer long cable laying works. It is learnt that their rival (Ropuia's faction) had earlier collected money at the same rate of percentage for the 15 kilometer long cable laying works already completed on Tipaimukh road.

12.1.2012 A press release dated 7.1.2012 purportedly signed by Ramthan Hmar SS Southern Commander of HPC(D) was published in Vanglaini daily newspaper this morning. The press release while expressing support for their president Lalhmingthanga Sanate, strongly resented the peace initiatives taken up by Thanglianchhunga and his colleagues alleging that their motive was merely for personal gain.

 It was reported that Zosangbera, Gen.Secy. of the rival faction had reacted taking exception for publishing such item while their press release werer never published in the Aizawl based newspapers. Zosangbera also expressed suspicion that the press release was mere handiwork of former HPC factional leader Lalrosiem who happened to be the cousin brother of the deposed president Lalhmingthang Sanate.

 It was learnt that Lalhmingthang Sanate faction are intending to submit a memorandum to the Govt. of Mizoram in the near future for holding/resuming talks.

 Press Statement enclosed in _Annexure-XVII_

14.2.2012 The Executive Council of the HPC(D) after expelling its president Lalhmingthang Sanate from his position and party, put the party in interim for six months. In its recently concluded sittings, the Executive Council of the HPC(D) collectively adopted a written Constitution for the party. In pursued of strengthening the goals of the party and the collective aspirations of the Hmar people, the Executive Council of the HPC(D) has finally put an end to the interim state of the party by electing H.Zosangbera as the Chairman of the HPC(D). The HPC(D)'s new constitution has also opted for chairmanship system instead of president-ship system to reoganise the party structure.

 The HPC(D), after the ceasefire with the Govt. of Assam and the Govt. of India, is currently engaged in a constructive political process in Assam. To secure the political aspirations of the Hmar people of Assam, the HPC(D)(Assam Region) will be headed by its vice-chairman Elvis L.Hmar and Secretary David L.Hmar. The HPC(D), hereby, reiterate its stand that it will not engage in any 'press release battle' with the expelled Lalhmingthang Sanate who outrageously sold out the unity and integrity of the party.

 When the HPC(D) is engaged in a significant peace and political process in Assam, Manipur and Mizoram with the sole interest of securing the political aspirations of the Hmar people, the party is also weaving the collective resolutions of the Hmar people who are divided by political boundaries. At the same time, the HPC(D) is also seriously engaged in building peace at all levels. Therefore, the state actors should not be confused when it comes to talking to the HPC(D). Let no one entertain a divide and rule game when the cause of the people is inevitably at stake.

15.2.2012 Information received from different sources revealed that representatives of all political party leaders from 12 (twelve) villages of Tuisualral numbering about 50 (fifty) met HPC-D cadres at Thingpuikual (Manipur), on the bank of Tuiruang river adjacent to Kani village (Zokhawthiang, Mizoram) @ 8:00 PM on 15.2.2012 as summoned by the HPC-D. The meeting took place in the residence of Thingpuikual village authority chairman and lasted for 2 (two) hours.

 The HPC-D cadres headed by Lalbiakliana @ Biaka, S/S Area Commander, accompanied by 8 nos. of HPC-D cadres, all armed with sophisticated AK-47 rifles and M-16 rifles told the 50 strong members of different political party leaders to help all HPC party candidates win for the ensuing V/C election within Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) area, in a polite but pursuasive and compulsive manner.

 Some of the political party leaders reached Vaitin village last night @ 9:00 PM and the second batch arrived Vaitin @ 11:20 PM last night, i.e. 16.2.2012. As per the report of political party leaders who attended the meeting, the HPC-D are very determined in their diktat and disobeying their request within SHDC area would be very risky for any political party leaders within the area. Further input received from the interaction of village leaders suggested that casting of votes with peace of mind may be impossible in this situation even if foolproof security is provided in the area during election if the result of V/C election comes out against the wishes of HPC-D insurgent group.

18.2.2012 Input received indicated that the HPC-D summoned all party leaders of three (3) villages on 18.2.2012 at Dolakhal (Assam) which was attended by 16 village representatives, i.e. Saipum - 6, Mauchar - 5, Saiphai - 5. The HPC-D who summoned the villagers are 8 - 10 in number, all armed with sophisticated weapons.The leaders, Neihliana (who hailed from Sakawrdai) told the village leaders to make HPC VC in their respective villages for the forthcoming VC election as winning the VC seats by HPC party would be crucial for resumption of peace talk between HPC-D and Government of Mizoram.

 The village representatives raised their voice against the diktat of the insurgent group by stating that all nominations of VCcandidates had already been finalised and they might not be in a position to inform all the voters in such a short notice. HPC-D, however, insisted that they would do so as they were told and further warned that they would be held responsible if the outcome of the election became against the wishes of the HPC-D.

 It may be mentioned that HPC party filed their nomination in the following villages as under :-

 (i) Saipum - HPC party - 5, Others - 5

 (ii) Saiphai - HPC party - 5, Others - 5

 (iii) Mauchar - HPC party - 3, Others - 13

 Unconfirmed report received from source stated that the HPC-D Sangbera faction had been convinced by Thanglianchhunga, President, HPC party, Sakawrdai during his visit to Manipur sometime back and the HPC-D leadership, in compliance with their meeting’s outcome, has carried out such action.

22.2.2012 information received from Sunhluchhip village stated that one Remsanga, VC candidate of Sunhluchhip village was contacted through mobile phone by one who claimed himself as Biaknunga of HPC-D telling him to elect only HPC party candidates in their village for the ensuing VC election. The matter was informed to Constituency MLA, Pu R. Lalpianmawia today, i.e. 22.2.2012 by Sunhluchhip VC members. Some VC candidates contacted by CID (SB) officers stated that they are in a dilemma whether to concede with the demands of the caller who called himself to be HPC-D as there could be a chance of imposter playing dirty tricks. It may be mentioned that there are 3 VC seats at Sunhluchhip in which the following parties are contesting seats as under :-

 (1) Congress - 3

 (2) ZNP + MNF - 3

 (3) HPC - 2

There are indications that weapons are being shifted towards Tiaulien side once coast is clear. It is obvious that they have changed earlier plan of moving along Tuiruang river downstream from Tipaimukh as they sensed that the Army were on high alert about their movement. CT Sungte has been instructed to proceed towards Hmarkhawlien to avoid possible arrest by Security Force. S/S Army Chief Ropuia intends to go to designated camp on Dt. 14/15.03.2012.

17.4.2012 The HPC(D) (Sangbera's faction) had issued a press release today expressing strong resentment over the alleged attitude of the CYMA leaders on the issue of the HPC(D)'s demand for an Autonomous District Council. The press release which was purportedly signed by John F.Hmar, Secy, Info&amp;Pub., HPC(D) had alleged the CYMA as having made a resolution opposing the upgradation of Sinlung Hills Development Council to a status of Autonomous District, and demanded justification of the CYMA's plan of executing its 'Year Theme' i.e. to safeguard Mizoram and Mizo tribe.

 In its press release, the HPC(D) had also issued strong 'diktat' dissolving the entire branches of YMA within its demand area, and to submit all their seals to CYMA. The HPC(D) further warned of dire consequences to any branch of YMA who defies their order.

 It is reported that a copy of the PR was found in a letter box at Aizawl press club earlier today. The YMA leaders were learnt to have reacted sharply and called an emergent CEC meeting today at 4:00pm. The meeting strongly condemned community based politics to divide Mizoram and also reacted the HPC(D) diktat to dissolve YMA branches within the demand area and informed all concerned YMA branches not to submit their respective seals to CYMA. The CEC meeting also agreed to talk to HPC(D) at the earliest convenient time to sort out their alleged misunderstanding.

 Press Note enclosed in _Annexure-XXI._

20.4.2012 Input received suggests that there is likelihood of the HPC(D) indulging themselves in unlawful activities in the near future to intimidate the YMA branches inside their demand area of Mizoram, in pursuance of its 'diktat' issued dt.17.4.12 for dissolution of all YMA branches within their demand area. As per the input received, SS Comdr. Lalbieklien has been entrusted to carry out the order. There are possibilities of the HPC(D) cadres either entering into Mizoram to carry out the order or intimidate the YMA leaders through phone calls.

  The HPC(D) feels an urgent need of recruiting more cadres from Mizoram as they are convinced that their recent press release had hearted the sentiments of the Central YMA as well as the entire establishment.

  In the meantime, the Central YMA are understood to be considering whether or not to visit Sakawrdai area as leaders of the YMA branches in the area are reportedly panic following the HPC(D)'s intimidation.

24.4.2012 HPC(D) issued a PR today reiterated that they are still firm in their stand that unless CYMA approve Autonomous District Council for Hmar dominated areas and the languages of Hmar, Ralte, Lai, etc are accepted by CYMA as Mizo language. Solution of the current problem through dialogue would be meaningless and HPC(D) would do whatever it takes to safeguard the people.

1.8.2012 The HPC(D) has issued a press release today Dt. 01.08.2012 which was posted in Facebook page 'Special Report' and 'Virthli'. In its press release, the HPC(D) strongly resented the arrest of their leaders namely H.Zosangbera, S/S Chairman on Dt. 17.07.2012 at IGI airport, New Delhi and Lalropuia S/S Army Chief and Biaknunga S/S Dy Army Chief on Dt. 10.06.2012 at Silchar Airport. Alleging the Govt. of Mizoram as violating the SoO signed between the Govt. of Mizoram and HPC(D) on Dt. 11.11.2010 as well as the SoO signed between the Govt. of Assam and HPC(D), the press release stated that while its Chairman H.Zosangbera was on his way to meet officials of the Home Ministry, Govt. of India, its Army Chief Lalropuia and Dy Army Chief Biaknunga were on their way to visit the HPC(D) designated Camp and to attend a peace meeting with leaders of all party leaders (Mizoram).

 Also refuting the accusations by the Govt. of Mizoram that HPC(D) were planning attacks on the people of Mizoram and disintegrating Mizoram, the HPC(D) in its press release asserted that their movement is not against any individual people or community but to secure Socio-Economic and political development of the Hmar in Sinlung Hills area.

 The press release also stated that LT Hmar has been appointed as Chairman by its Emergency Executive Council meeting held recently. The press release was purportedly issued in the name of Amos P.Hmar, S/S Secretary, HPC(D).

6.8.2012 Input received suggested that the combined group of HPC(D) and BNA elements may carry out some unlawful activities such as abduction, targeting government officials or any civilian in or outside the state in the near future to secure the release of their leaders presently detained in Central Jail, Aizawl. As reported earlier vide our SR No. MSB/CB/SR/2012/497 dated 09.07.2012; this combined group may also resort to sabotage targeting railway track from Assam linking Bairabi and power supply lines.

 According to fresh input received, the combined group has divided themselves into three groups with an attempt thereby to possibly launch some simultaneous attacks on soft targets such as passenger or goods carriers traveling along the Mizoram-Assam highway. In the meantime, the possibility of this group targeting our B.O.Ps in Saipum/Saiphai area in Kolasib district, and those of Tinghmun and Khawlian areas in Aizawl district cannot be ruled out.

 Further considering their past activities, patrolling in certain areas such as Chhimluang and Vairengte located along the highway needs to be intensified as these places provide easy escape route through the jungle towards their jungle hideout located in Khawbawn forest in Mizoram-Assam border.

 2) Information received stated that the HPC(D) in what appears to be a retaliating act on the recent attempt by Mizoram Police to arrest CT Sungte S/S Dy Chief of Army at Zilthaw on dt. 24.07.2012, had served a notice to the temporary settlers of Zilthaw to leave the village before Dt. 15.08.2012.

 Lalbiakzama, designated team leader representing the GoM presided the meeting. He welcomed and thanked the HPC(D) delegates for attending the dialogue and also appreciated the efforts of the HPC(D) in finding an amicable solution to the problems of the Hmar people in Mizoram.

 LT. Hmar, working Chairman HPC(D) submitted the memorandum of the HPC(D) that was addressed to the Chief Minister of Mizoram. The same memorandum was also addressed to the GoM, the Union Home Minister and Jt. Secretary (North East), Govt. of India.

 The HPC(D) memorandum termed the July 27, 1994 Memorandum of Settlement(MoS)/Peace Accord that was signed between the GoM and the HPC a hollow political instrument; and not accepted by the HPC(D). 19 years after signing of the MoS, it has proved to the world that the document holds no water and does not stand to fulfill the aspirations of the Hmar people to secure their political future.

 In pursuance of the unfinished agenda of the Hmar people, the HPC(D) is committed to find a lasting, dignified and acceptable political solution to the Hmar's aspirations with the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council in the State of Mizoram within the scope of the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. This will be of mutual benefit and based on the long term interest of both the Sinlung originated Hmar peoples and the GoM.

 The HPC(D) remain fully and firmly committed not to seek separation from Mizoram but rather seek to find a permanent solution to the protracted Hmar issue in Mizoram, which is compatible with the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India. The HPC(D) firmly believes that to protect Hmar identity, culture, tradition, language, land, resources and to enhance political development and democratic decentralization in Mizoram, the only pragmatic option lies in the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council.

 HOC(D) advocates a long term solution that addresses and ends the political marginalization suffered by the Hmar people in Mizoram. It also believes that no solution will lead to enduring peace if it is devoid of political justice and political will and it would not be just if it does not promote and enhance the political aspirations of the Hmar peoples.

 The HPC(D) demands that the Union Government of India and the Government of Mizoram make sincere, committed and concerted efforts to fulfill the aspirations of the Hmar peoples. The unfinished agenda should be politically settled in accordance with the Constitution of India with the following objectives:

 1. To initiate tripartite dialogue involving the Govt. of India, Govt. of Mizoram and the Hmar Peoples Convention-Democratic for the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council within the State of Mizoram.

 2. To provide constitutional safeguards and protection to the Autonomous body as under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.

 In the course of the dialogue, the issue of further extension of SoS which is due to expire in July 2013 was raised by Team Leader representing the GoM. The HPC(D) leaders firmly maintains its stands that any furhther extension of SoO should be intricately linked with fixation of definite timeline for political dialogue within the month of July 2013. The talks met a stalemate as it was submitted by the HPC(D) delegates that the issue of further extension of SoO also require prior consultation and decision of the HPC(D) council.

 The HPC(D) strongly felt that extension of SoO in Mizoram has no meaning if the prospect for a meaningful political dialogue is not put in place. The democratic interests and aspirations of the Hmar people should not be down played by a negligent and irresponsible delay tactics. The Hmar's aspirations is to justly secure the Constitutional promises, which otherwise has marginalized us.

On seeing the approaching Police party, some persons started running and were asked to stop.

One of the attackers was hit by the defensive fire while others managed to escape. The attacker, who was hit, succumbed to his injuries and was identified as deserter Constable **H.C.

The said ammunitions are supposed to be carried by Inspr.Tlangthangzuala @ Zuala, O/C Parbung Police Station, Manipur Police and his party who will be conducting spot verification and enquiry on the recent incident at Tiaulian, Manipur. Police party who are supposed to carry the ammunitions will be travelling in Police Gypsy and another vehicle probably Mahindra Bolero hired by HPC(D) will be carrying pro-HPC(D) Cameramen and journalists.
