(iii) **Current political situation in Bangladesh, its likely impact on Indo-BD relations on border and influx of Bawm community BD Nationals** :

 The current political situation in Bangladesh remains tense. The KNA being accused of carrying out attacks on the government and civilians, the Bnagladesh government has been responding with force, deploying troops to the CHT, imposing curfews and other restrictions upon the civilians. Despite the tensions, there have been several attempts at dialogue between the Bangladesh government and the KNA.

  However, till now there has not been any reaction from the leaders of KNF/KNA and refused to surrender the looted arms to the government. The situation in the CHT remains volatile, with ongoing fighting and human rights abuses and as such, more refugees are expected to enter Mizoram .

  The Indo-Bangladesh border in Mizoram Lawngtlai and Lunglei District are actively patrolled by the BSF and the activities along the border is closely monitored by the District Police. No new influx of refugees is reported in the last 4/5 months possibly due to the political transition in Bangladesh.
