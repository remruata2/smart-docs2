Subject: Agenda for the forthcoming Conference of Chiefs of ATS/STFs/etc - regarding.

Ref. : No. MCID/C-24/2019/147 dt 8th Oct., 2020.

 As desired by DIG,CID, I am hereby elaborating the Enhance Technical Capability of intelligence Agency in Combating Terrorism as below:

**Enhance Technical Capability of intelligence Agency in Combating Terrorism.**

**Elaboration:**Mizoram shares 319.791 Kms. long international boundary with Bangladesh and 496.531 kms. long international boundary with Myanmar. These porous international borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar served as important routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs. The porous border areas have also widely encouraged other criminal activities like abduction/kidnapping of Indian citizens by Bangladesh based insurgent groups.

  In order to curb the infiltration, smuggling and other anti-national activities from across the Indo-Bangladesh and Indo-Myanmar borders, the enforcement and intelligence agency along the borders are needed to enforce with high quality of technical equipment, such as, Arms scanner, Binoculars including night vision, Drawn, Computer set/Laptop for data collection, etc.

  This is for your kind information and further necessary action.
