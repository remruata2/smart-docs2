****Identification & Repatriation Process****

****( 2nd phase – for those not in the E/Roll of Mizoram but claim to be from Mizoram )****

1. An exercise to identify the number of Bru families , in which at least one member of the family is included in the Electoral roll of the State, was earlier undertaken by the respective District Administration in November,2016.
2. The target families for identification in the 2nd Phase would involve those Bru families left over from the above exercise in the 6(six) recognised transit camps.
3. As a first step of identification, there may be stray instances in which any member of the left over families of Phase 1 of the Identification process are otherwise enrolled in the Electoral roll of the State, in which case the families may be identified for repatriation. It is not necessary that all eligible persons of a family are registered in the Electoral roll.
4. Otherwise, the existence of any relatives/direct ancestors (grand parents, parents, uncle, aunt etc) in the electoral roll of the State may be taken as an enabling criteria for identification, for which documentary proof shall be available.
5. Given that regular revisions of electoral rolls have been conducted for the Bru families in the camp, the reason for non-inclusion in the electoral roll of the State may be explained by the family members to the satisfaction of the Identification Officer.
6. The above explanation may be correlated with the duration of their stay in the Transit camp, for ascertaining which documentary proof like ration card issued by the Govt. of Tripura etc or summary enquiry on the spot may be of help.
7. The Ration Card issued by the R&amp;R Dept of Government of Tripura shall be invariably be demanded for considering the claim of the families for identification for repatriation. However, freshly issued ration cards i.e after the date of signing the Agreement for repatriation may not be given due weightage.
8. There may be instances in which the list of family members submitted for identification does not match with the list of members indicated in the Ration Card. If the list of members does not match/ is more than what is indicated in the ration card, reasons for the same should be explained to the satisfaction of the Identification Officer, who shall accordingly indicate in the proforma his observation/recommendation ( like exclusion of excess family members from identification process, etc) against such discrepancy.
9. There may also be instances in which the identity of the family members could not be ascertained either from the electoral roll or ration card, in such cases, any other documentary evidence issued by the State Govt. officials, Village Councils etc may be reasonably considered.
10. The identification process of the families could also rely on other circumstantial evidence like knowledge of the family members about their village of origin, village folks, adjacent village, terrain, rivers, localities, local practices etc of their place of origin.
11. In all the above cases, the onus of proof to establish their place of origin shall lie with the family members.
