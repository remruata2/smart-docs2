****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/172

Dated: 13th March, 2019.

 Information has been received that CEO, Mizoram had instructed DEOs of Kolasib, Mamit and Lunglei this afternoon, i.e. 13.03.2019 via Video Conferencing to conduct and facilitate appeal for Bru applicants who were rejected in the hearing during the last Special Summary Revision of Electoral Roll conducted on 26.02.2019 at Kanhmun especially for the Brus in the Tripura Transit Camps. Information received, otherwise unconfirmed, indicated that there was insistence from ECI for the CEO to take up the matter by arrangement of facilitation centre, most likely at Kanchanpur (Tripura), by the three DEOs.

 At the same time, NGO Coordination Committee (NGOCC) meeting held today, i.e. 13.03.2019 @ 1:00 p.m had demanded that Brus in Tripura Transit Camps should cast their votes in their respective Polling Stations in the upcoming MP (Lok Sabha) Election, 2019. The meeting also decided to object any facilitation attempt through arrangement of Special Polling Stations, similar to what was done in the last State Assembly Election held last year by setting up Special Polling Stations at Kanhmun, Mamit District. A Press Statement was also released in this regard in which they stated that they will be taking measures so that MP Election will not be conducted in the State.

 It may be stated that even while the NGOCC are presently being in a state of objecting even Special Polling Stations for the Brus in Tripura, facilitation of appeal for rejected Brus for enrolment in the Electoral Roll right before MP Election through special arrangement will most likely incite a very strong protest from NGOCC, which in the least will be akin to the ‘Hnamchhan Hnatlang’ held against the then CEO, Pu S.B. Shashank, before last year’s MLA Election.

 The Bru leaders at Tripura Transit Camps on the other hand, claimed that they had not approached the ECI in connection with the Special Summary Revision in which 160 new voters were enrolled out of 2,574 applicants during the Special Summary Revision of Electoral Roll for the Brus.
