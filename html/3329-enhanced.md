**Hunger strike cancelled******: Tuipuiral NGO co-ordination committee’s plan to start hunger strike to urge the government in fulfilling their demands was cancelled since they have new hope in the government. As planned, hunger strike was to start from Monday and people gathered at Khawbung from different villages of Tuipuiral region to begin the strike but 2 block leaders of Tuipuiral Congress requested them to cancel it and they obliged. Two block leaders will go to Aizawl to have a talk with authorities this week.

 The NGO Co-ordination Committee submitted a three point demand such as road maintenance, posting of more teachers and opening of police station in the region to the authorities but to no avail till today. Black flag was displayed at each house in the region since 13th May, 2013 to show their dismay but since it did not work and as hoped, a hunger strike was called from 27th- 31st May, 2013 which was cancelled lately.
