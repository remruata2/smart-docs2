Subj :- Assessment of threat perception.

Ref :- No.MSB/CB/B-19(A)/494 Dt.6.8.2018.

Sir,

 In response to your order no. mentioned above, security threat assessment in respect of Prof. Rajat Gupta was conducted and the findings are as under –

 The main reason behind the present problem faced by NIT, Mizoram in the first place was due to the complained made by NIT students against Dr. Bhijayananda Mohanty, Asst. Professor, Civil Engineering Department because of his Misbehavior against them. These NIT students along with MSU General Headquarters blamed Dr. Rajat Gupta, Director of NIT for not taking enough legal actions against Dr. Bhijayananda Mohanty. On 26.7.2018 angry MSU Leaders even met Dr. Rajat Gupta in his Office and even over turned his desk in front of him telling him of their intention to take further necessary action to fulfill their demands.

 At the moment, Prof Rajat Gupta and Dr.Bhijayananda Mohanty hesitates to attend their office. Prof. Rajat Gupta himself has been out of station due to official duties and is expected to return to Aizawl on 10.8.2018.

 As of now, no immediate threat is perceived against Prof Rajat Gupta. However, as it is not yet ascertain whether Dr.Bhijayananda Mohanty will be instructed to resume his normal duties(which can further escalate the situation), it may be suggested to provide Prof. Rajat Gupta with a personal Security officer (PSO) for him to discharge his duties smoothly and with confidence.

 Ministry of Human Resource has bee informed about these incidents, who in return notified that it the responsibility of the State Govt. about the Security matters.

 ` Yours faithfully,
