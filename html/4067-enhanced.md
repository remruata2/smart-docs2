 Kindly refer to your letter no.CB/PHQ/C/212/21/130 dt.24/04/2025 regarding veracity report of BGB Booklet, discreet enquiry had been conducted to find out the veracity of the Names/Address and Location of insurgent camps, miscreants of Chittagong Hill Tracts (JSS Santu Lama Group, UPDF and KNF) as mentioned in the letters.

Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, I am to state that discreet enquiry had been conducted to find out the veracity of the Names/Address and Location of insurgent camps, miscreants of Chittagong Hill Tracts (JSS Santu Lama Group) as mentioned in the letters. However, so far, neither such miscreants nor any permanent insurgent camps mentioned in the above letters have been found within the state.

 Regarding Prasit Bikash Khisa, President, UPDF there has been no reports of him entering Mizoram. Reliable input indicated that he was in Delhi last year (2023) after which he proceeded to South Korea where he has been staying till date.

 As for KNF, it has been reported that, previously, they often visited Hmawngbuchhuah and Bungtlang South villages of Lawngtlai District, Mizoram and returned to Bangladesh after staying two/three days. However, after the bank robberies committed by them on 2.4.2024 inside Bangladesh, none of their leaders are inside Mizoram and are believed to be hiding inside Bangladesh side of the Indo Bangladesh border areas.

 Efforts are still underway to find such miscreants and insurgent camps and findings, if any will be communicated to you at the earliest.

  This is for your kind information and further necessary action please.
