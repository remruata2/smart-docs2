Subject: Infiltration of Rohingya Muslim from Myanmar-regd.

Ref. : No. CB/PHQ/C/400/11/175. Dt. 16.4.2013

Sir,

 With reference to your letter and subject cited above, I am to state that on receiving the above referred issue, prompt action has been taken up by this Office by sending W/T message to the concerned District S.P. and Sector Officers of CID(SB) and they were asked and instructed to enquire whether any Rohingya Muslim entered into Mizoram. An information was received from one Kandra Tong, Ex-VCP of Bandukbanga, Lawngtlai District that in the early part of this year some Rohingya Muslim refugees tried to enter into Mizoram from Longudu (Myanmar) near Bandukbanga. But the Arakan Liberation People (Myanmar insurgent group) prevented those refugees from entering into Mizoram. Longudu is about 7Kms from Indo-Myanmar border inside Myanmar. Bandukbanga lies inside the jurisdiction of Vasei PS about 67 Kms from Vasei PS and it is situated near Parva village in the southern most part of Mizoram. The exact numbers of Rohingya Muslim refugees were not known and the exact date and time in which they tried to cross the border could not be ascertained at present. There has been no other report of infiltration in other parts of Mizoram as on today.

 Situation is under constant watch.

  Yours faithfully,

**    (H.RAMTHLENGLIANA)**
