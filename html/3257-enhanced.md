In their letter, Asteria Aerospace Ltd. provided three types of their products namely – A400 VTOL Mini UAV,CYGNUS Fixed Wing Mini UAV and Genesis. Details of each of these products apart from those given in their enclosure are as under :

1. A400 VTOL Mini UAV : A400 Vertical Take off and Landing (VTOL) is a type of UAV which hovers up for take off and hovers down for landing like conventional helicopters. Compare to fixed wing UAV, its payload and ranges are lower. However, they are easy to handle and does not require an expert for its operation.

The A400 mini UAV combines best-in-class range &amp; endurance with advanced payload capability forsurveillance and security applications. The system provides real-time high resolution video for day or night operations with advanced features for monitoring and analysis. Its compact size and verticaltakeoff/landing capability make it ideal to operate in a constrained environment.

2. CYGNUS Fixed Wing Mini UAV :

 Asteria’s CYGNUS A10 is a mini Unmanned Aerial System designed from the ground up for military and civilian surveillance applications. The system consists of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a MissionControl Station (MCS). The UAV flies autonomously from takeoff to landing and carries a high resolution daylight/infraredcamera for aerial observation. The MCS displays real-time video from the UAV and allows the user to command and control the UAV.

 The CYGNUS A10 differentiates itself from its competitors by being the first-in-class UAS to deliver real-time HD resolution aerial video. This is 5x more video resolution than standard definition video streamed by existing UAS. This innovation allows operators to spot much greater detail in their aerial images and videos leading to higher effectiveness of the system. The high definition daylight camera can be swapped with an infrared camera for night time operations.

**SALIENT FEATURES**

- **Mobile**– Small, lightweight and modular for rapid deployment
- **Autonomous**– Automatic takeoff, navigation and landing
- **Effective**– Delivers real-time HD resolution video from the UAV to the ground station.
- **Terrain Independent**– No runway is required and as such operable in any terrain
- **Reliable**– All composites construction for robust all-weather operation
- **Secure**– Encrypted digital data link for secure transmission of data and video
- **Safe**– Failsafe mechanisms to protect the system
- **Stealthy**– Silent electrical propulsion, inaudible at 150 m

 CYGNUS A10 UAV is designed to be modular to allow it to carry other payloads besides video cameras including still cameras, atmospheric monitoring sensors, radiation sensors and acoustic sensors. All the major components of the CYGNUS A10 system including the airframe, the autopilot and the GCS interface are designed and developed by Asteria Aerospace.

**APPLICATIONS**

 The CYGNUS A10 Unmanned Aerial System has several military, paramilitary, commercial and industrial applications. Any application that can benefit from low cost, real-time, localized aerial surveillance is a fit for the CYGNUS A10. The applications highlighted below are indicative and not exhaustive – the potential uses of this technology are limited only by imagination.Contact usto explore how the CYGNUS A10 can meet your needs or for custom solutions for your application.

****MILITARY AND PARAMILITARY APPLICATIONS****

The CYGNUS A10 can be used as a highly effective tool in military and paramilitary operations. Its capability to deliver real-time high resolution day or night video along with its ruggedness, portability and ease of use make it an indispensable platform for such applications. The CYGNUS A10 is ideally suited as an ISR platform to support offensive operations over-the-hill recce missions, low intensity conflicts, battlefield damage assessment, deception operations as well as defensive/peacetime operations such as border security, convoy protection, and planning and monitoring battle positions.

****POWERLINE AND PIPELINE MONITORING****

An emerging industrial application for the CYGNUS A10 aerial surveillance system is the monitoring of long stretches of electrical powerlines and oil/gas pipelines for damage, leaks, and security, especially over terrain which is hard to reach over ground. The ease of use and low acquisition and operating cost of the CYGNUS A10 system make it an ideal candidate to automate such tasks for the energy industry.

****NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT****

The CYGNUS A10 also finds applications in managing natural resources such as mineral ores, forests, water bodies, wildlife and marine life. It can assist authorities in mapping and enforcing boundaries of coal and ore mining.It can support wildlife preservation efforts as a surveillance tool against poaching and smuggling activities. It can be used to map and monitor boundaries of forests and water bodies, locate areas of fish population and many such applications which can greatly benefit from low cost aerial surveillance.

3.Genesis :

 This is a software that enables the users to monitor,command and control Asteria’s network-centric mini UAV platforms from any device connected to the same network regardless of Geographic location. The platform allows multiple users to simultaneously monitor data feed from a particular UAV at multiple geographic locations,conduct data analysis on current and past mission data as well as disseminate chosen data to select user as needed. The Genesis platform allow the storage and mining of data from all UAV platforms connected to its network. For any state level integrated command centre, this feature of live feed directly from various distant locations can be a great help and game changer in controlling crime.

Prices : As far as the prices of their products is concerned, Asteria Aerospace did not mentioned any in their letter nor their website (www.Asteria.co.in). An email was also sent to them on 28th July 2017, requesting the price ranges of their product which has not been replied till date. Whatever the reason for their hesitancy in replying the e mail may be, it can be assumed that the prices of their UAVs will not be less than Rs.500000 because their products are highly sophisticated and state of the art technologies.

Conclusion : In my humble opinion, before procurement of any UAVs, the intended purpose may be put into consideration firstly. In this way, selection from the various types of UAV can be made accordingly. As a beginner, for instance Mizoram Police Department, it may be suggested to start with VTOL or Hovering system of UAV like A400 Mini due to its easy handling compared to Fixed Wing UAV. Fixed wings are complicated and its sensitivity requires an expert to handle it. Moreover, as they are superior to hovering UAV, they are much more expensive. Its hardly economical to train a novice using a complicated fixed wing UAV which cost around rupees three lakhs or even more, where a much cheaper and easier handling VTOL UAV can be used.

 Apart from the information contained in their letter, Asteria Aerospace Ltd. themselves did not provide much detail of their products in their website. To obtain further information, enquiries may be made to them through a proper channel. They can even be requested to visit our establishment to give presentation of their products, their willingness of which was clearly highlighted in their letter.
