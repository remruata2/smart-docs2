****BRU MILITANCY****

****Since the last part of 1997, a group of Bru youths took up arms and started demanding a separate Autonomous District Council for the Brus residing in Mizoram and formed an armed group to support their demand which was strongly objected by the Mizos in the concerned area.

 Migration of Bru from Mizoram to Tripura started on 15.10.1997. The apparent cause of this migration appears to be the strong reaction of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by the Brus. Following the strong reaction of the MZP in opposition to the demand for an ADC by the Brus, a number of Bru families started migrating to Tripura from 15.10.1997. While arrangement were being made for the return of the fleeing Brus from Tripura to Mizoram, Lalzawmliana, Wildlife Forest Game Watcher was murdered at Persang in DampaTiger Reserve on 21.10.1997 by Bru Militants. This murder and subsequent incidence like burning of houses resulted in Brus migration to Tripura in large number. The fleeing Brus from Mizoram were accommodated in various refugee camps in Tripura. Inspite of an all out efforts made by the Central Government and Mizoram Government to repatriate these Bru refugees, it appears that majority of Bru refugees are still reluctant to return to Mizoram.

**Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM):**

 Whereas, different armed groups of the Brus namely Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF), Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM) and Bru National Council of Tripura (BNCT) are not active anymore, a new group who called themselves Bru National Union (BNU), Bru Revolutionary Army (BRA), Bru Liberation Army (BLA) etc. was formed in 2009 under the patronage of National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT), a Tripura based insurgent outfit. The group has changed its name in the last part of 2012 as Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM). They are the remnants of the erstwhile BLFM who refused to surrender at the time of the latter's mass surrender on 26.10.2006 before the Government of Mizoram. These BDFM cadres are mainly responsible for the heinous crimes which occurred in the western areas of Mizoram bordering Bangladesh and Tripura during the recent past which included kidnapping for ransom, forceful collection of donation, extortion, etc. They seem to have no concrete aims and objectives and could be classified as armed gang.

**Their areas of influences:**

Zopui and Thangnang situated in the western part of Mizoram, and also inside Bangladesh.
