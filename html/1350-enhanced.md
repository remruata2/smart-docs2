CONCLUSION :

 The scuffle which arose between MZP and Assam Police due to border issue at Zophai resulted in the announcement of Non-Mizo curfew by the students’ organization under the aegis of Mizo Students’ Union (MSU) on 10.3.2018. The curfew was soon called off and there was no report of untoward incident.

 However, many non-Mizos left Mizoram out of fear for their own safety; there were rumours among themselves about possible consequences due to the border issue.

 As of now, the on-going initiative taken by representatives of Mizoram and Assam Government under the guidance of Central Government is under close watch and life is peaceful and normal. Most of the Non-Mizos who had left Mizoram have come back to Mizoram and resumed their normal routine life. It is also reported that Wednesday Market at Bairabi was also resumed as before, goods were sold by Non-Mizos as usual under a peaceful normal atmosphere. Situation, by and large has returned to normalcy.
