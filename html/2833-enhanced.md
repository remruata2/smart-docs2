_ASSESSMENT OF THREAT PERCEPTION IN CONNECTION WITH HON'BLE_  _PRESIDENT OF INDIA VISIT TO MIZORAM_

 In connection with the upcoming Hon'ble President of India visit to Mizoram, discreet assessment on threat perception was conducted across the state by officers and men of CID (SB) Headquarters Office and Sectoral Office, located in different district headquarters and sensitive areas. So far, the threat perceived against the intended visit of the said VVIP is considered minimal at the moment based on the report of the above stated security threat perception assessment.

 There has been no report of any anticipated threat from insurgent groups operating in the neighbouring countries and states. In respect of insurgent group operating within the state, there has been no report of any active insurgent group after Government of Mizoram and HPC (D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts of Mizoram) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC (D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where the Cadres and Council Members of HPC (D) came to over ground at the ceremony. However, efforts are being underway to keep close vigil on any anticipated insurgent activities within the state.

 The activities of various insurgents groups operating in our neighboring states and countries, such as NLFT, NSCN(K), ZRA, PLA, UNLF etc. have been constantly monitored and there is no input having direct or indirect bearing on the security in connection with the visit of Hon'ble President of India. Similarly, close watch and vigil have been given to developments in Myanmar as well as Myanmar refugees in Mizoram and there is no input concerning threat to the safety and security of the VVIP.

 Further, there has been no report of any anticipated threat from individuals, political parties, NGOs and students’ bodies within the state in connection with the visit of VVIP and no report of any intended agitation/strike which could disrupt the movement of VVIP has been received till date.

It may also be mentioned that a message to all State/UTs Intelligence Unit was sent (vide this office file No. MSB/CB/B-59(A)/ 291 DT. 28.04.2022) requesting them to communicate any threat in connection with the visit of Hon'ble President of India to SP CID(SB), Mizoram through the quickest possible means. In this regard, so far no reply has been received from any of these States/UTs.
