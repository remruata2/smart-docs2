****Regional Security Strategies Conference – 2025****

1. **Challenges in addressing Narco menace in North East** :

**Introduction****:**

**Mizoram has a long international boundary with two countries (496.531 km with Myanmar and 319.79 km with Bangladesh) and 284 km of inter-state boundaries with three other north-eastern states – Assam, Tripura and Manipur. Interestingly Mizoram lies at the periphery of the Death Triangle formerly Golden Triangle historically known for its drug manufacturing and trade. Mizoram has porous international border****with Myanmar and Bangladesh, the rough terrain, lack of proper connectivity poses a huge challenge to security forces at the border areas, it hampers their movement and limit their ability to check drug trafficking and to rapidly respond attempts made by criminals.**

1. **Prevailing drug situation in Mizoram****:**

 There has been an increase in illegal cross-border drug smuggling and Mizoram has become a favorable transit route for transporting them to other parts of the country. Major drugs trafficked into Mizoram are heroin, methamphetamine and ganja. The routes of drugs trafficked in Mizoram are as follows:

1. Heroin is smuggled mainly from Myanmar and Assam, mostly destined for mainland and other parts of the country.
2. Methamphetamine (Yaba tablets) are smuggled from Myanmar through Mizoram for transporting to mainland and neighboring country like Bangladesh and no local consumption is recorded so far.
3. Ganja is smuggled mainly from Manipur and other parts of mainland India for local consumption.
4. There are 2 (two) main conventional routes and 4 (four) new routes mainly utilized by drugs trafficker within Mizoram.
