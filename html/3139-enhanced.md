However, no suspected person, who might be responsible for the stated incident was seen from Mizoram side and no person from Mizoram side has been allowed to visit the area since border tension erupted at the area.
 In connection with the above incident, bomb-squad team from Masimpur Police Camp, Forensic expert and around 20 (twenty) Assam Police Commando personnel visited the area the same day and they left the area the same evening after conducting necessary examinations. 

 It may be mentioned that the above incident may be orchestrated in an attempt to link with an explosion incident, which was occurred on 29.10.2021 @1:25 a.m. at one unoccupied Assam Forest Building, located around 100 meters southwest of Pu Ch. Chhunga’s paddy field, near Zophai, Bairabi.

1.  Shri. Kuldeep Singh, DG, CRPF visited Vairengte on 6.11.2021 and held an informal meeting with Assam and Mizoram Officials at CRPF Camp, near Auto Stand, Vairengte. The meeting was attended by DIG (SR), Assam; DIG, CRPF; SP, Kolasib and DC, Cachar. During the meeting, Assam officials pointed out that Mizoram Police border duty should be pulled back from their camp at Auto Stand, Vairengte and boundary should be maintained same as before COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. However, SP Kolasib reiterated that vacation or handing over of Mizoram Police Camp near Auto Stand (the bone of contention) to CRPF is not possible and he also mentioned that both parties should maintain peace and normalcy at the area so as to avoid escalation of border issues in future.

 Situation is under close watch.
