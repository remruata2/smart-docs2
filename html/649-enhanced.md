Subject: Action taken report in connection with arms smuggling by JSS insurgent outfit etc regarding.

Respected Madam,

 I have the honour to bring to your kind notice that based on input shared from SB Tripura received on some JSS cadres and their local agents of Chakma residing inside Mizoram of Lawngtlai district are procuring arms and ammunitions, this unit instantly mobilized our Sector Office posted on the ground and sent a WT Message on 12.8.2013.

 Sector Officer of CID(SB) and staff started covert operation against the arms smuggler and JSS outfit as soon as they received this office WT Signal by engaging local sources. While they are about to crack the case, some agencies like Assam Rifles intelligence from Aizawl and Lunglei are also launching an operation without co-ordination and even without sharing information to each other resulting in the failure of first phase of our covert operation within Kamalanagar area.

 The unsuccessful operation was also conveyed to this office on 21.8.2013 by Sector Officer of CID(SB) and reported that the arms smuggler alongwith their agent had shifted from Kamalanagar area to Lawngpuighat area on that day. Nevertheless, they were instructed to closely co-ordinate with other agencies and pursue the matter more earnestly. In compliance with our instruction, Sector Officer, SB Chawngte accompanied by his two staff moved from Chawngte towards Lawngpuighat area on 24.8.2013 and are still stationed at Lawngpuighat concealing their identity. It was reported that the arms consignment and some JSS cadres are still at large and our men on the ground are still launching covert operation. In order to strengthen the existing force who were launching operation, a new team of 3(three) CID(SB) personnel under the command of one Sub-Inspector is being sent to assist the operation party and they will leave Aizawl for Lawngpuighat early tomorrow morning i.e 28.8.2013.

 This is for your kind information please.

Enclo: 1. Message received from SP, SB Tripura.

 2. Message initiated from SP CID(SB) Mizoram
