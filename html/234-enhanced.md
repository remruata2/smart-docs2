****ASSESSMENT OF THREAT PERCEPTION IN RESPECT OF TUICHAWNGCHHUAH VILLAGE****

Presently, there are 13 Chakma families living in Tuichawngchhuah village. As of now, the situation is peaceful with no law and order problems.

 However, as the eviction order for the inhabitants of Tuichawngchhuah village, issued by Government of Mizoram was stayed by the Hon’ble Gauhati High Court on 8.1.2016, the verdict of the Court on this issue is kept pending. Moreover, if the Court passes a judgement in favour of the Chakma inhabitants, leaders of MSU Regional Headquarters even expressed their intention to take further necessary action if security personnel are withdrawn from the village.

 Considering the above circumstances, it may be considered necessary to continue the deployment of security forces at Tuichawngchhuah village as a preventive measures and to instill sense of security to the inhabitants.
