No. MSB/CB/C-193/     Dated Aizawl, the Nov, 2015

To,

 The Deputy Inspector General of Police (Hqrs.)

 Mizoram, Aizawl.

Subject: Situation Report over the prevailing law and order situation over land dispute between Bawngkawn local people and Baptist Church of Mizoram (BCM), Bawngkawn.

Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. PHQ/AB/ 31/SITREP/171 Dt.18.11.2015, I am directed to submit the input of CID(SB) Field staff over the above stated subject for your kind information and necessary action.

 (i) A team of CID (SB) Field Staff had interacted with 3(three) Church leaders of BCM Bawngkawn _(Upa Dr.Lengkaia, Upa Lalnghakliana, Upa L.L Rokhuma)_, 8(eight) leaders of Bawngkawn Local Council _( Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer,4 members)_ and 4(four) leaders of Branch YMA Bawngkawn _(President, Vice President, Secretary, Asst. Secretary_) during 19-20.11.2014. After having interaction with both leaders (BCM,Bawngkawn, Local Council,YMA Bawngkawn), the CID(SB) team found that the situation remains volatile as the leaders of both sides stood firm on their standpoint.

 (ii) On Dt 13.11.2015, Local Council, Bawngkawn and all NGO of Bawngkawn YMA, MUP, MHIP) issued a Joint Press Release in which they strongly condemned the initiative of the Church leaders of BCM, Bawngkawn over the construction of Church within the disputed land(Restricted area of Bawngkawn Brigade). In the Joint Press Release they also expressed their strong determination to oppose any kind of such activities/initiative within Restricted area of Bawngkawn Brigade, Aizawl (_enclosed Press Release in Annexure_).

 In light of the above, it is anticipated that if all the 2(two) section of 5th IR personnel performing patrolling duties are completely withdrawn, there is every possibility of escalating the present situation into violent confrontation between the two sites. However, reduction on the scale of security deployment may be considered.

Yours faithfully,

(LALRINPUIA VARTE) Addl. SP
