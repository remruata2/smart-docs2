****STRENGTH AND STATUS OF HPC(D) OUTFITS****

**1. Lalhmingthanga Sanate :**

 He is the founding President of HPC(D) which was formed in 1996. Till today, he has not surrendered to the Government and is presently residing in Hmarkhawlian village, Assam with his family and a handful of his followers.

 When a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) way back in 2018, Lalhmingthanga Sanate designated his HPC(D) splinter faction as 'HPC(D) (President's Group)' and did not participated in the said MoS. During that time, his group consisted of around 13 cadres with an estimated 4/5 weapons holding. However, by February 2020, 11(eleven) of his cadres deserted him and joined HPC(D)- General Headquarters Sinlung Group, who are under the leadership of Lalkhama @ LK Hmar.

 At the moment, it is believed that there are only a cadre or two under the command of Lalhmingthanga Sanate, who himself has a great inclination towards surrendering himself to Government of Mizoram. At the same time, he is expected to have a couple of demands before finally surrendering.

**2. Lalthansanga @ LT Sanga @ Sang Samsei-a :**

 'HPC(D), Manipur Region' is a group led by Lalthansanga, whose area of operation is around Churachandpur town, Manipur. This group is affiliated to United People Front (UPF), a collaboration of various insurgent groups of Manipur and their leader, Lalthansanga is one of the members of Joint Monitors Group of UPF.

 Even after the signing of accord between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) in 2018, this group still retained some arms and continued collection of 'Donations' inside Manipur. It may also be mentioned that several of the HPC(D) cadres, who received rehabilitation package as a result of the 2018 Accord joined this outfit again.

 Recently, due to their demands of money and provision from Mr.Vungzagin, MLA, 56th ST, Thanlawm Constituency, Manipur, 15 of its cadres were arrested by the police. However, they were later released on bail, with Lalchuailova @ LC Hmar, Council Member and two others still in Police Custody, though. Presently, this group consisted of around 30-40 cadres.

**3. Lalkhama @ LK Hmar :**

 The Group under Lalkhama designated themselves as 'HPC(D) General Headquarters Sinlung'

 Established in April 2019, this group was formed by former HPC(D) cadres who came over ground after the Peace Accord of 2018. These members/cadres blamed their leaders of misappropriating Rs.50,40,000/- which were deducted from Rehabilitation Packages of 63 cadres @ Rs.80,000/- each meant for distribution to the bereaved families of cadres who had died earlier as a result of their cause.

 There are an estimated 20-30 cadres in this group under the command of their self-style Commander-in-chief, Lalkhama @ LK Hmar, whose family are presently residing in Saikot, Churachandpur, Manipur. Their area of operation is in and around Churachanpur town of Manipur.

 It may be estimated that there will be around 4/5 SBBL or AK 47 rifles in their arsenal.

 The members of this group are mainly from former HPC(D) cadres who had surrender to Government of Mizoram in 2018. Apart from them, except for one or two new recruits from Manipur, not many have newly joined this HPC(D) faction.
