|  1 |  Inter State Coordination Mechanisms to set up for synergy in Counter-Insurgency operations |  The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful. Although peaceful, Mizoram is surrounded by countries and states which are having many disturbances with respect to insurgency and terrorism.  Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. In the North, the insurgent Group, HPC(D) is currently undergoing Peace Dialogue with the State Government which has shown positive direction. As for the North-Western region, the Bru insurgency has been contained to a great extend so much so that this insurgent Group has become more or less a group of Bandits without any definite demand or objectives. For these areas, IGP (int.) or IGP (Hqrs.) may be suggested as Nodal Officer.  Having International Borders with Myanmar, the Southern Districts are often affected by insurgencies of Myanmar in the form of refugees fleeing the conflict between insurgent groups and Myanmar Army and recently, injured militants seeking medical treatment inside Mizoram. To monitor any insurgencies related incidents from the southern side, SP, Lawngtlai may be suggested as Nodal Officer.  |
|  2 |  Developing institutions for specialized training of Police in Counter-Insurgency operations |  It is unlikely that the State is able to setup separate institution for Counter Insurgency Operation Training. As such, maximum numbers of personnel from the State Police may be nominated for Counter Insurgency Training in all the available training Centres relating to it. Personnel attending these trainings may be grouped as a regular unit so as to enable them to impart further training to their fellow colleagues - apart from participating in actual Counter Insurgency Operations themselves.  |
|  3 |  Training of Police for improving investigative skills/basic policing |  For training of Police for improvement of investigative skills, the following points may be considered :   (a) Topics on investigation procedure may be increase in the syllabus of PTS, Thenzawl.  (b) More in-service training on investigation procedure may be organised by Training Branch, PHQ.  (c) Adequate training on investigating aids such as Forensic, Cyber knowledge, mobile phones etc. may be organised.  (d) In the past, as the State Police has been assisted by different NGOs many a times in the course of investigation, Police-Public relation development training may be conducted. Reluctant/lack of reliable civilian witness often resulted in acquittal of criminal cases.  (e) Organising training/workshop with lawyers may be organised so as to uncover different loop holes committed by investigating officers during crime investigations.  (f) As far as possible,if training can be conducted using the native/local language of investigating officers for the above mention points, optimum result might be obtained.  |
