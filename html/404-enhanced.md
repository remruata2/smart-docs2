****BRIEF NOTE ON HPC(D)****

 The Hmar communities who settled in the North Eastern part of Mizoram have been demanding a separate Autonomous District Council for more than 2 (two) decades by taking up arms. A peace accord was signed way back in 1994 between Government of Mizoram and HPC, the Hmar militant group. However, certain group of persons who are disgruntled with the accord continued their armed activities resorting to kidnapping, collecting donations, extortion and threats in Sinlung Hills Development Council Areas and formed HPC(D). They even hampered the proper functioning of our Democracy by intimidating the Hmar community not to participate in the recent Village Council election of Mizoram held on 30th April, 2015. This resulted in the arrest of their top leaders.

The HPC-D was formed in 1996 by remnants of the HPC who were disgruntled with the MoU signed between HPC and Govt. of Mizoram in 1994. The HPC-D resorted to violence from the outset of its formation like extortion, kidnapping and ambush of security forces.

The HPC-D had split into two factions on 29.9.2011. One faction is led by the ousted President Lalhmingthanga Sanate and the other faction led by H. Zosangbera. Lalhmingthanga Sanate's faction is less in number and is not active now whereas H.Zosangbera's faction is still active till today and is being involved in several criminal activities such as, ambush, kidnapping, extortion etc.
