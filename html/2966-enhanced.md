****DRAFT REPORT ON MIZORAM BORDER DEFENCE ARMY(MBDA) TO BE SENT TO ASSAM POLICE****

As per input, Pu Lalhmingthanga Sanate, Founder President of Hmar People Convention (Democratic), presently residing with his family members at Hmarkhawlian, Cachar District, Assam (who refused to come over ground during the Peace Accord signed by HPC(D) and government of Mizoram in the year 2018) held a meeting with RC Singson @ Ramchanlova (former Army Chief of HPC(D)) of Thenzawl, Mizoram on 15.12.2021 at Hmarkhawlian, Assam in connection with the tense inter-state border situation. After discussing the matter at length, the duo decided to raise new outfit in the name of “Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA)” with the following plan of actions:

1. To launch attack against Assam Police deployed along Assam-Mizoram border with Arms.
2. To threaten/intimidate Non-mizos residing along the Assam-Mizoram inter- state border.
3. To procure sufficient amount of arms and ammunitions from National Socialist Council of Nagaland –NSCN (IM).
4. To collect donations from residents of Saiphai, Mizoram and its surrounding areas for procurement of arms and ammunitions.

Input received indicated that the present arms holding of HPC (D) are 10 (ten) Nos. of AK-47, which are kept at Hmarkhawlian, Cachar District, Assam.

In pursuance of the above decision, RC Singson, Commissioner/Commander -in- Chief of MBDA, along with the following persons served ‘Demand Letter’ using HPD

1. Letter Head to Non-Mizo residents of Chemphai and Saiphai and its surrounding areas during the latter part of December 2021: Lalngaisanga @ Sangtea - SS Commander Lalhriatzuala, Saiphai (civilian) Jamala(Vai) - SS Pvt. MBDA, Saipum. Basira, civilain (Address not known) Zodawlliana @ Dawla of Saiphai (civilian)
2. Lalngaisanga @ Sangtea - SS Commander
3. Lalhriatzuala, Saiphai (civilian)
4. Jamala(Vai) - SS Pvt. MBDA, Saipum.
5. Basira, civilain (Address not known)
6. Zodawlliana @ Dawla of Saiphai (civilian)

1. Lalngaisanga @ Sangtea - SS Commander
2. Lalhriatzuala, Saiphai (civilian)
3. Jamala(Vai) - SS Pvt. MBDA, Saipum.
4. Basira, civilain (Address not known)
5. Zodawlliana @ Dawla of Saiphai (civilian)

It is also learnt that, the above mentioned persons carried one .32 Pistol and Miniature (.22 Rifle) mounted with Telescope while serving the ‘Demand Letter’ and extorted money amounting to Rs. 52,000/- from various persons.

On 25.1.2022, Mizoram Police nabbed (1) Lalhriatzuala, Saiphai and Sunday Lalrinsanga, Saiphai while they were extorting moneybased on their Demand Letter and

also seized 1(one) no. of AK-47 Magazine and 3(three) rounds; Mobile Phone - 4 (four) nos. and 3(three) rounds of Miniature (.22Rifle) from their possession. However, the below mentioned persons managed to evade arrest:

1. Lalngaisanga @Sangtea, Commander, MBDA
2. Jamala, SS Pvt. MBDA of Saipum
3. Basira (civilian), Address unknown.

In connection with the above incident, Vairengte PS C/No.3/2022 u/s 395 IPC r/w 25(1A) Arms Act Dt. 26.1.2022 has been registered. The following day i.e., 27.1.2022 RC Singson, Commissioner/Commander -in-Chief of MBDA was arrested by Mizoram Police and he along with the above mentioned 2(two) arrested accused were remanded into Judicial Custody on 29.1.2022.

However, the above mentioned 3 (three) absconding accused persons are still on the run and attempts have been made for their immediate arrest. It is suspected that their hideout is within Assam territory.

The outfit named ‘Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA) was raised and coined by Lalhmingthanga Sanate, founder President, HPC (D) in his attempt to take personal advantage of the recently tensed Assam-Mizoram inter-state border situation. It may be worth mentioning that investigation of the above mentioned case revealed that cadre of ‘Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA) were behind various incidents of bomb exploded and unexploded at the disputed border area near Saihapui ‘V’.

It is suggested that immediate arrest of Lalhmingthanga Sanate, founder President, HPC (D) and the absconding accused is the need of the hour as they may pose threat to internal security of both states viz. Mizoram and Assam, and Non-mizos residing along the inter-state border and Assam Police deployed along the inter-state border. It may be noted that Pu Lalhmingthanga Sanate, founder President, HPC (D) is the mastermind in the above incidents and the same were executed for his own personal interest.
