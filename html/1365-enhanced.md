Subject: Deserter from IAF Sgt. Pawih Bawitlung Sangdingliana regarding.

Ref: No.PHQ/IGP-MISC/2014/10 dt.31.7.2014.

Madam,

 Apropos the above, I am sending herewith the enquiry report as under.

 A thorough enquiry was done on a deserter from IAF Sgt. Pawih Bawitlung Sangdingliana. After a meticulous enquiry and investigation, it was found that he is residing at House No.– 68 of Falkland Veng, Zemabawk. His residence was searched with an attempt to arrest but could not be located.

 His wife, Lalhriattiri was contacted and interrogated and she said that her husband, Sgt. Pawih Bawitlung Sangdingliana is the only male person in the family and that his family is running a stable business which enables them to lead a comfortable life without working in Indian Air Force. So he quitted his job. She also said that it is unlikely that her husband is the kind of person to work abroad or to join any underground group.

 It was found that the deserter IAF Sgt. Pawih Bawitlung Sangdingliana quitted Indian Air Force as he has a stable occupation. It is, therefore, reasonably assumed that he is currently hiding somewhere in India apprehensive of his arrest.

 This is for your kind information and further necessary action.

Yours faithfully,
