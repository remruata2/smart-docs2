Subj :-  Threat perception assessment - reg.

Ref : No. CB/PHQ/C/204/2018/198 Dt. 7th February, 2020

Sir,

 In compliance to your letter no. and subject mentioned above, report on assessment of security threat perception in respect of all Cabinet Ministers, Minister of State and all members of Legislative Assembly having Constituencies along the interstate and international borders is hereby furnish as follows :

 During the course of threat perception assessment, sources and contacts, links and informants from insurgent groups having operating area adjoining to the interstate and international border were contacted besides constantly monitoring their activities and movements. Despite the existence and presence of different insurgent groups having base and operating areas alongside the interstate and international border, it is learnt that at this moment, none of these underground insurgents pose any direct threat nor endangers the lives of any of the elected legislators of the State of Mizoram in the discharge of their duties and responsibilities. These insurgents of the State of Assam, Tripura, Manipur and the neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh have varying political objectives. Impending issues undertaken by NGOs, student bodies, civil society organisations were also taken into account too.

 Therefore, the threat perceived as against each of the legislators of the State of Mizoram from insurgent groups, NGOs, student bodies, civil society organisations, political enmity or even from personal animosity is considered minimal at the moment.

 It is concluded that the scale of provision of PSOs to all Cabinet Ministers, Minister of State and all members of Legislative Assembly having Constituencies along the interstate and international borders is sufficient in the current scenario.

 Submitted for favour of kind information and further necessary action please.

 Yours faithfully,

** (K.LALREMSANGA)**
