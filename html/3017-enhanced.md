 The Repatriation process of Brus living in Tripura Relief Camps continued for the fifth day today, i.e. 9.10.2019. 2 (two) families having 11 (eleven) members from Kaskau Relief Camp were repatriated today. Another 4 (four) families with 14 (fourteen) members from Khakchangpara Relief Camp reported directly to the Liaison Officer, Kanhmun Facilitation Centre and they were repatriated at Bungthuam and Bawrai.

 Information has been received Mizoram Government Officials proceeding to Naisingpara Relief Camp for repatriation activities were prevented by around 650 (six hundred fifty) Brus who assembled under the banner of Bru Displaced Women Welfare Committee (BDWWC) at Ashapara Relief Camp. Officials returned back to Kanchanpur, North Tripura. It is learnt that the BDWWC is intending to prevent any repatriation of Brus from the transit camps.

 Mizoram Government Officials engaged in repatriation process at Kaskau Relief Camp held a meeting with leaders of BDWWC, Kaskau Bru Women’s Organisation and Kaskau Upa Pawl. The 3 (three) NGO leaders brought to the notice of the Officials their various demands and standpoints.

 Information has also been received that Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Forum (MBDPF) convened a meeting with MBDPF Ashapara Camp and BDWWC at MDBDPF Office, Ashapara, under the chairmanship of Pu A. Sawibunga, President. The outcome of the meeting is not available at the time of writing this report.

 6 (six) Bru NGOs, viz. MBDPF, Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement (MBIDM), Bru Tribal Development Society (BTDS), BDWWC, Camp Defence Committee (CDC) and All Chudri Committee (ACC), issued a joint Press Release yesterday, i.e. 8.10.2019, highlighting, inter-alia, the following points :-

1. We strongly condemn the Government of Mizoram for sending the vehicles unnecessarily for repatriation even after the Hon’ble Home Minister of Mizoram has been intimated by MBDPF, MBIDM and BTDS through District Magistrate of North Tripura on 30.9.2019 that we are unable to return until and unless our demands are met.
2. The Government of Mizoram is not following its own action plan enshrined in the road map for repatriation and the on-going repatriation is not a peaceful means.
3. The construction of Rehabilitation Centre in Mizoram is worse than cattle shed and is not good for human habitation as a family.

1. Appreciate and welcome the decision of the Hon’ble Union Home Minister to resolve the 22 years vexed issue of Brus through interlocutor.
2. The Central Government and the Government of Mizoram should conduct magisterial enquiry to probe on the death of Smt. Linda @ Kahgrakti, 28 years, who was burnt alive by her Mizo husband, Shri. Vanlalvena @ Tevena of Tlangkhang village.

Situation is under close watch.
