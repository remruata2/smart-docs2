**II. **Security scenario in Mizoram with special reference to insurgency and smuggling**:**

   **Insurgency :**

 Security scenario in Mizoram is mostly peaceful. However, with the influx of refugees into Mizoram due to the political condition in the neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh, some commercial activities are being exploited/used by these refugees to earn their living which is not welcomed by the local residents of Mizoram. Moreover, the refugees have started involving in criminal cases within Mizoram.

 Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and reorganise themselves during the year 2022. They have been indulging in collection of donation and extortion from the closing months of 2022. In this regard, 27 criminal cases have been registered in Mizoram against the cadres of Lalhmingthanga Sanate (HPCD) faction till date out of which 8 cases have been Chargesheeted and 7 HPC(D) cadres arrested. However, no new activities of the HPC(D) is reported.

**Smuggling:**

Due to the peaceful nature and the geographical proximity of the state to the Death Triangle, Mizoram has been exploited as a safe route for smuggling of narcotics drugs. After the military coup in Myanmar on February, 2021, there has been an increase in the number of seizures of narcotics drugs in Mizoram possible either due to the funding of some ethnic armed groups by narcotic smugglers or the direct involvement of these armed groups in the smuggling activities to fund their operations. The ethnic conflict in the state of Manipur which started in the month of May, 2023 disallowed movement of goods including smuggled narcotics drugs across the state which further increases smuggling of narcotics through the state of Mizoram.

The modus operandi and ways of concealment of smuggled narcotics used by smugglers is constantly evolving. The past seizures of narcotics in the state revealed that these drugs are often concealed in sealed food packages, vegetables, electrical goods and more commonly inside a car door panel or costumed concealed compartment inside a vehicle.

Smuggling of explosives in the state is witnessed mainly after the military coup in Myanmar which could be attributed to the reported use of such explosives by ethnic armed groups to fight against the military junta. These smuggled explosives mainly consist of gelatin sticks and its detonators are illegally procured locally from some explosive licence holders who often gave out the explosives for mining purposes. The number of arms and ammunition seized in the state even though decreases in the last few months, the possibility of arms and ammunition smuggled across the state by some ethnic armed groups of Myanmar could not be ruled out due to the recent capturing of most of Myanmar Army camps in Chin and Rakhine state.

Further, the emerging trend of using end to end encrypted messaging applications and compartmentalizing activities like logistics, finances or intelligence gathering by different groups or units complicated the interception of modern narcotics syndicates.

III. **Conflict in Myanmar and its impact on Mizoram**:

 The arm resistance put up by the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) in general and armed ethnic groups of Chin State, Myanmar to overthrow the military regime in Myanmar since 1st February 2021 resulted in the influxes of considerable number of refugees particularly the Chin Community into Mizoram. Since the Military Coup, there has been a reported 8 (eight) major influxes of Myanmar Nationals into the State.

 On December 8, 2024 at 9:30 am, the Arakan Army had captured the last remaining outpost of Myanmar Army’s Border Guard Police Division (Nakhakha-5) located in the Maungdaw region of Rakhine state. With the fall of Nakhakha -5, the Arakan Army now controls the entire region bordering Bangladesh. The Arakan Army has launched its offensive against Myanmar Army and its establishments in Rakhine states since November 13, 2023.

 However, it is to be mentioned that Sporadic clashes continue to occur in certain areas within Maungdaw region against Islamic extremist militants viz., Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO) and Arakan Rohingya Army (ARA) which had earlier collaborated with Myanmar Army. To prevent Myanmar Army personnel as well as the Islamic Militants groups from escaping into Bangladesh, the Arakan Army had suspended all river transportation across the Naf river (Rakhine side) for indefinite period.

No new influx is reported recently.
