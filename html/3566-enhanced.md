**Violation of Rules by NHIDCL :**  Contractors working under National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL), who are presently engaged in the widening of National Highways in Mizoram are not properly following Rules and norms in their process of dumping the excavated soil. This greatly affected the environment while at the same time depriving the sources of livelihood of the local population.

 Inspecting these working places on last Saturday, members of Mizoram Journalist Association (MJA) found that these working contractors, instead of using designated Spoil Bank for dumping of the excavated soil, they are simply push beyond and over down the edges of the roads. As these process damages not only the vegetation, it also disturbed the habitat of aquatic animals down in the streams and rivers, MJA expected the state government to closely monitors the widening works of these National Highways.
