****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/325

Dated: 17th May, 2019.

  Information has been received that 3 (three) Bru Organisations, namely; Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Co-ordination Committee (MBDPCC), Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement (MBIDM) and Bru Tribal Development Society (BTDS), which had recently held a joint meeting at Asapara Bru Transit camp, had decided to form a ‘Joint NGOs’ Core Committee’ as a representative body for the different Bru Organisations and appointed the following persons as its Office Bearers:

1. Chairman  - Vipin Kumar (BTDS)
2. Vice Chairman - Phillip Apeto (MBIDM)
3. Secretary  - Laldingliana (MBDPCC)

 These 3 (three) Office Bearers will further appoint 3 (three) persons from each of the 3 (three) organisations to constitute a committee. They had intentionally excluded Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Forum (MBDPF) and will take up issues separately. The Joint NGOs’ Core Committee intended to come to Mizoram at the earliest to meet the Hon’ble Chief Minister and other Officials in which they are likely to request alterations of certain points in the Road Map of the ongoing Bru Repatriation Process which will likely include 1) clustering of Bru returnees in no less than 500 household per village and 2) extension of free ration from 2 (two) years to 3 (three) years, among others. They are still pondering on other points to be included in the memorandum to be submitted to the Government of Mizoram.

 On the other hand, leaders of MBDPF claimed that they did not recognise this newly formed ‘Joint NGOs’ Core Committee’ and will not acknowledge any initiatives taken by the Committee.
