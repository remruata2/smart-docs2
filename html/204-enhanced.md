Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, I am submitting herewith assessment report of threat perception in respect of Pu SB, Shashank, Chief Electoral Officer(CEO), Mizoram and the report of this assessment are as under –

 Pu SB. Shashank joined Civil Service of Delhi in 1990 and have been holding various posts including Addl.Secretary, Home, Delhi; Special Vigilance Commissioner, Delhi, etc. His first posting in Mizoram State Govt. was Director of ATI in July 2016 and presently posted as CEO, Mizoram since April 2016.

 During the course of assessment, the enquiry officer had interacted with Pu SB. Shashank and he informed the enquiry officer about the sensitiveness of his current assignment i.e. CEO/Secretary, Election Department and even mentioned about the Election Commission of India(ECI) direction to provide round the clock PSO to CEO vide Point No.20 of Election Commission of India(ECI) New Initiative-2016(enclosed).

 However, as of now, no specific imminent threat is perceived against him be it from insurgent groups, political parties, NGOs or even from personal enmity. Considering the sensitivity of the election process and in view of the upcoming State General Election-2018, it is recommended that he may be provided 1(one) PSO. 

 Submitted for kind perusal and necessary action please.
