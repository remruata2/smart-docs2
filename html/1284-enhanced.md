Sayad then developed a good relation with Bashir and after 2/3 months, Bashir began to talk with Sayad about Islam and Jihad, etc, and day by day Sayad interests for Islam grew.

 Sayad accepted Bashir’s remarks that Jihad is a necessary part of Islam and every Muslim’s duty is to join Jihad for the sake of Allah. After that, Bashir asked Sayad’s opinion about joining any Jihadi group and Sayad replied that he wanted to join such organization that works for the establishment of Deen (Muslims way of life) in the land of Allah.

 After almost a year, Bashir instructed Sayad to cross Indo-Bangladesh border from Kasba-Kamalasagar border.

**Reached Agartala, Tripura, India :**

****In the first week of October 2018, Sayad crossed Into India from Kasba-Kamalasagar border by evading BGB and BSF guards at the border and reached Agartala. Before seven (7) days coming to India, Bashir handed Sayad Rs. 15000/-. On reaching Agartala, he took a room at Ramnagar area of Agartala at Rs. 1500/- and started selling Amra (Hog Plum), Pitha(Rice Cake), etc, for 3 months.

**Change of location to Dharmanagar, Tripura :**

****After 3 months as per Bashir’s instruction and for security reasons, Sayad changed his location from Agartala to Dharmanagar and rented a room at Botorosi area, Dharmanagar, at Rs. 1500/- per month.

During his stay at Kanchanpur, Sayad demanded money from Bashir and in April 2019, he was handed Rs. 21000/- by one unknown person at a CNG Station near Agartala Railway Station. And after one month, he was again handed Rs. 20000/- at a Masjid in Bishalgarh, Agartala.

**Plan to settle in Mizoram :**

****Bashir instructed Sayad to find a suitable place in Mizoram border area and instructed to find smugglers who could provide them with arms and ammunitions for Ansar-Al-Islam. As per instructions of Bashir, Sayad used to buy new mobile phones every time he changed his locations, and also bought new pre-activated forged Sim cards from Agartala market at high price. On 19th July’ 2019, he alone came to Mizoram upto Rajiv Nagar and stayed in the house of one Chakma (name not known) for a night, but since could not find any place to stay went back to Kanchanpur.

**Receiving of Mahmud Hasan :**

****On 21st July’ 2019, Sayad was instructed by Bashir to receive Mahmud Hasan at Dharmanagar Railway Station. Sayad received Hasan on 22nd July’ 2019 at the Station and took him back to his place at Kanchanpur. And after one day, they received instructions from Bashir to go to Mizoram. Then on 25th July’ 2019, they reached Rajiv Nagar and stayed at Tourist Lodge for one night. The next day, they missed the Sumo service to West Phaileng, they decided to go Phaileng via Marpara. They then contacted one boatman for going to Marpara @ Rs. 500/- per head. The boatman then took them upto Silsuri only, and they stayed at the boatmans house since there was no hotel at Silsuri.

 Next day on 27 July, Sayad and Mahmud went to Marpara by another boat. At Marpara, they met with one businessman from Silchar who told them whether they have ILP pass or not as it is mandatory to take ILP pass to enter Mizoram. On enquiry about doing business in Mizoram, that person told him to at first possess trade license from Govt of Mizoram. He also alerted them not to go further as this may be not good for them. At this, they got frightened and since there was no hotel to stay they decided to return to Kanchanpur. They again took a boat for Silsuri. On reaching Silsuri, they could not find any boat bound for Rajiv Nagar. They then decided to stay at Silsuri, but since nobody were willing to accommodate them at their houses, they were told to meet with the Village Chief.

 Another reason for not allowing outsiders was that there was a rumors going on in Bangladesh and bordering areas of Bangladesh about the need of 1800 persons for construction of a bridge at Padma River in Bangladesh, for this reason people bordering Bangladesh were suspicious that their wives and children may be kidnapped or murdered by miscreants for this purpose. So it was ordered in each and every village that unknown persons coming to the village area be verified by the Village Chief. So, they too were taken to the village chief of Silsuri. The Village Chief brought in BSF officials and after interrogation, they felt suspicious of their behavior and handed them over to the Police on 28th July’ 2019 at around 6-6:30 Pm.
