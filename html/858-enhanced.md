**SECURITY RELATED ISSUES**

1. At Present there is PLA (Manipur based insurgent group) camp inside Myanmar adjacent to Mizoram, this matter needs to be considered seriously with Myanmar government. It has also been found that different North East insurgent groups like UNLF, NDFB and NLFT occasionally have meeting inside Myanmar and used Mizoram as exit route. Alertness must be maintained regarding this matter.

2. Let it be reiterated that better sharing of intelligence inputs between Government of India and Government of Myanmar be emphasized especially around the Indo - Myanmar Border. As such, the establishment of Hotline to SP Saiha District and SP Champhai District with the Myanmar Government in the bordering post be given priority to combat the movement of Insurgents, Arms smugglers and Drug traffickers etc.

3. The recent seizures of Arms cache, Narcotic drugs and Hides / skin of protected and endangered animals reportedly indicates that Mizoram and Manipur has been used as a route to smuggle arms, Narcotics etc, to India, this unwanted infiltrations could only be eliminated by the efforts of both Government. Therefore Borders post in both sides should be more alert and stringent actions be taken against such infiltrators.

4. Let the interrogations result of captured Insurgents groups, Arms Smugglers, Drug traffickers be shared uniformly to have better control of unwanted movement in the border.

**DRUGS TRAFFICKING**

 Illegal transportation of Narcotic drugs like Pseudoephedrine, Cetirizine, Proxyvon, etc. is quite rampant recently. Transportation is often done from mainland India and North East state through Mizoram, these narcotic drugs are to be prepared for abusive substances at Myanmar. Stringent preventive measures should be discussed with Myanmar government.
