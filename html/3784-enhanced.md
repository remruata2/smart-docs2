****WRITE-UP ON HPC(D)****

Hmar People's Convention-Democratic (HPC-D) is an offshoot of the Hmar People's Convention (HPC), which came into existence in 1986, as a political party spearheading a movement for self-government in the north and northeast of Mizoram.

In 1992, HPC representatives and the Government of Mizoram mutually agreed to hold ministerial level talks. Consequent to 13 (thirteen) rounds of such talks, a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed at the Mizoram capital Aizawl on July 27, 1994, for establishing the 'Sinlung Hills Development Council' and subsequently, 331 HPC militants surrendered along with their arms. However, dissatisfied with the implementation process, a section of the cadres parted ways with the over ground HPC and formed the HPC-D in 1996. The HPC-D had split into two factions on 29.9.2011. One faction is led by the ousted President Lalhmingthanga Sanate and the other faction led by H. Zosangbera. HPC-D faction led by H. Zosangbera is more active now.

The main aims and objective of the HPC(D) is to create Autonomous District Council in Hmar tribe inhabited areas in north and north-western part of Mizoram bordering Manipur and Assam states.

 And whereas, the Government of Mizoram is also of the opinion that the activities of HPC(D) for the reasons mentioned above are prejudicial to the security and integrity of the state and have the potential of disturbing peace and harmony of the country as well.

 (i) mobilizing their cadres for escalating their subversive and violent activities.

 (ii) extorting and collecting huge funds and illegal taxes from the public for their unlawful activities.

 (iii) procuring sophisticated arms and ammunitions from across the international border.

  (iv) indulging in increased killings of civilian and targeting of the police and security personnel.
