(i) _SECURITY SCENERIO IN BARAK VALLEY (ASSAM) AND MIZORAM_:

 The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful. Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern regions while the state is surrounded by countries and states which are having various insurgency and terrorism related problems.

1. Input received indicated that Lalhmingthanga Sanate, founder President of HPC(D) has been travelling from Hmarkhawlian, Assam to Churachandpur, Manipur and visited Sialmat, Saikawt and Lamka. The information stated that Lalhmingthanga Sanate is intending to revamp HPC(D) by undertaking recruitment in Manipur and recall his volunteers/followers. Unconfirmed report indicated that he had so far recruited around 30 (thirty) persons. He also met people who took part in the signing of Peace Accord between Government of Mizoram and HPC in 1994 and apprised them about the various agreements which are allegedly not implemented by Government of Mizoram including establishment of Hmar Autonomous District Council under 6th Scheduled of  the Indian Constitution.

  It has been reported that Lalhmingthanga Sanate and leaders of HPC(D) Returnees Association of Manipur (1994) namely, Laldawnlien, President, Saikawt Manipur; Siamkung, Vice President, Saikawt Manipur and Alan Famhoite, Ex-Army Chief HPC(D) General Headquarters Sinlung, Rengkai Bible Hills, held meetings with regard to their course of actions at Saikawt and Sialmat (Manipur) recently. They have also been conducting recruitment of volunteers in Churachandpur District, Manipur.

 The following are the action plan of Lalhmingthanga Sanate :

 1) To revive HPC main demand on Government of Mizoram, i.e.   establishment of Hmar Autonomous District Council.

 2) To make alignment and support a particular political party for the   upcoming 2023 Mizoram General Election. However, they have  not yet decided which political party to align with.

 3) To publicize the various limitation/drawback of the incumbent   Sinlung Hill Council.

 Lalhmingthanga Sanate faction of HPC(D) has around 10 (ten) volunteers presently and they are mainly operating in Hmarkhawlian area (Lakhipur Sub-Division, Cachar District, Assam) and at the bank of Tuiruang river by collecting extortion/tax. They are reportedly having only 2/3 arms and it has also been reported that they are trying to procure arms and ammunitions from insurgent group in Manipur like KNO.

 It may be mentioned that Lalhmingthanga Sanate was invited to participate at the signing of Peace Accord between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) in 2018 but he declined the invitation. He also did not approve the Peace Accord signed between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) in 2018.

2. The insurgent organizations United Democratic Liberation Army (UDLA) led  by Doinaram Riang and Bru Revolutionary Army of Union  (BRAU) led by Rajesh Chorkhi were formed way back a decade ago. These organizations were formed seperately with the objective of creation of separate homeland for the tribals living in the Assam-Mizoram border. These insurgent groups had undertaken and indulged in various criminal and subversive activities to achieve their objective. However, as a result of continuous and sustained negotiations with regard to their demands and objectives with the government of Assam, these two organizations had laid their arms numbering around 100 before the Assam Police in 2019. The reported cadre strength of the  two organizations is around 664. In pursuance of the negotiations, the state government of Assam created the Bodo Kachari Welfare Autonomous Council (BKWAC) in April, 2021 wherein BRAU President Rajesh Chorkhi had been appointed as an Executive Member.

 It is to be mentioned that there were disgruntled cadres from these insurgent groups ever since before these two organizations had reached an agreement with the government of Assam. After several rounds of deliberations, these disgruntled cadres formed the United Tribal Liberation Front of Barak Valley (UTLFB) in mid May, 2022 with Jiten Reang (former Vice President of BRAU) as its President and Lalawmpuia (Ex-BNLF) as its Army Chief. Their cadre strength is estimated to be around 20 while their arms possession includes 3 nos.of Ak-47, 3 nos.of SBBL/DBBL and few local made Pistols.

 In the early part of September, 2022 United Tribal Liberation Front of Barak Valley (UTLFB) had set out in the Mizoram-Tripura border in an attempt to engage with Tripura Police in order to snatch their weapons. However, their attempt had been foiled due to the alertness and vigilance of Tripura Police prompted by intelligence inputs of several agencies. At present they have been scattered within Rifle Mara and Gutguti of Hailakandi District, Assam.

3.  It may also be mentioned that theboundary issue between Assam and Mizoramhas existed since the formation of Mizoram, first as a union territory in 1972, and then as a full-fledged state in 1987. A series of border violent clashes erupted along the border and recently, residents of Mizoram alleged the Assam government of constructing Bailey Bridge connecting Pu Chalchhunga’s farm land to Pu Lalnuntluanga’s farm land across Saihapui river, Phainuam-Buarchep area, Kolasib District, which is within the disputed area by violating the status quo, and there has been reported frequent patrolling of Assam Police and Forest officials within the disputed area without informing security personnel deployed along the border by Mizoram government. In view of this, border clashes could be erupted at any time, if both the states government deals the matter cautiously and through peaceful means, any alleged activities undertaken within the disputed areas should be immediately halted so as to avert any unwanted incidents along the border.

1. ___TRANS BORDER CRIME AND ILLEGAL MOVEMENT THROUGH BORDER INCLUDING PRESENT STATUS OF MYANMARESE REFUGEES IN MIZORAM_ :

_Border crimes and illegal movements:_ Although checking of vehicles for drugs and other contraband items has been conducted at Zokhawthar Police Check Gate (main entry point from Myanmar into Mizoram, India), smugglers/traffickers find alternate routes into Mizoram, crossing the river Tiau at various points along the 496.531 kms long porous international border with Myanmar.

 The **Free Movement Regime (FMR)** also permits tribal residing along the border to travel upto 16-km across the international boundary without visa restrictions. While the FMR has helped the tribes to continue maintaining their age old ties, it has also become a cause of concern for the security as its provisions are exploited by drug smugglers and traffickers to cross over to India (Mizoram) without any restriction. Another provision in the FMR, which allows tribal people to carry head load has also been misused for smuggling drugs, weapons and other contraband items. These head loads are seldom checked by the security forces.

 Refugees fleeing military regime of Myanmar are often reportedly engaged in the trafficking of drugs and other illicit substances. Monitoring the movements of these refugees who may be a possible drugs trafficker may result in the reduction of the flow of drugs from Myanmar to Mizoram. At the same time, good relations with leaders of these refugees may be maintained so as to spread awareness amongst the refugees and to find out any habitual drugs smugglers from them.

_Refugees:_ Many Myanmar refugees presently took shelter in various districts of Mizoram following military coup in Myanmar. These refugees are accommodated in their relatives’ house and makeshift camps set up by NGOs.

 The district wise details of Myanmar refugees are indicated in the following table (as on 9.12.2022) :

| **Sl.No** | **District** | **Total numbers of Refugees** |

| 1. | Aizawl | 3050 |

(vii) _NLFT(BM) / NLFT(PD) ACTIVITIES ACROSS BORDER IN BANGLADESH BORDERING MIZORAM STATE_ :

 NLFT(BM) : With the arrest of Jacob Hrangkhawl S/S President NLFT(BM) on dt.06.07.2022, no arrangement had been made so far to take charge of the post of President or to replace him either. There had not been any recent activities or movements within Sazek area. However, it is learnt that at present they are stationed within Masalong area. It is further learnt that Bomton S/S Army Chief had expressed his anger with the arrest of Jacob Hrangkhawl from Aizawl while blaming the Mizoram Police over their alleged involvement with the Assam Rifles. Inputs was also received indicating that they may intend to engaged in subversive activities against the government of Mizoram in retaliation to the arrest of their President.

 NLFT(PD) : It may be mentioned that an operational team of CID (SB) apprehended PARIMAL DEBBARMA, @ Phankrak who is Commander-in-chief of NLFT (Parimal Debbarma faction) on 12.03.2021 in Aizawl and was produced at Aizawl Police Station on 13.03.2021. After observing all the required legal formalities, he was handed over to Tripura Police on 14.03.2021.

 Apart from the above mentioned incident, there has been no report of any NLFT (BM)/NLFT (PD) activities inside or across the bordering areas of Mizoram.

(viii)  _Influx of Bangladeshi refugees in Mizoram and activities of KNA cadres inside_ _Bangladesh_

 On 15.11.2022, there was speculation among Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) that their camp ‘Capital Camp’ situated in between Salopui village and Chaihkhiang village of Bangladesh was approached by Arakan Army (AA) by means of Bangladesh Army vehicles and plan to attack. Consequence upon this, KNA had informed villagers of Sunsong, Salopui, Thingdawl and Chhaihkhiang villages of Bangladesh to leave their villages and took shelters. On 16.11.022, AA cadre numbering about 60 (sixty) entered Khaihkhiang village and send emissary from civilian to inform KNA that they wanted to hold talk with them. In response to this, KNA had reportedly sent 4 (four) KNA cadres and 9 (nine) civilians as delegates for the talk with AA. But it was reported that AA had detained all the 13 (thirteen) KNA delegates. Consequence upon this, encounter between Bangladesh Army backed AA and KNA started taking place. It was also reported that the main cause of the encounter between Bangladesh Army backed AA and KNA was that a few days back KNA had allegedly killed 1 (one) AA cadre and they also took away 1 (one) machine gun. In retaliation to this incident and to counter KNA from entering inside Banderban District, Bangladesh, the claimed operation area of AA, AA started the encounter. It was also reported that AA demanded KNA to return the seized machine gun and promise to release the 13 (thirteen) delegates of KNA detained by them in exchange of the machine gun. However, it was learnt that KNA have not yet return the machine gun to AA nor AA have release the 13 (thirteen) delegates detained by them. Information received also indicated that AA had given an ultimatum that they will take appropriate action against the 13 (thirteen) detained persons if KNA did not return the machine gun on or before 6:00 pm on. 21.11.2022.

 Kuki-Chin National Front (KNF) issued a reported Press Statement wherein they alleged that on 14.11.2022, a secret meeting was held between senior officers of Arakan Army (AA) and Bangladesh Army and Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) officials, Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) officials at Tamra at Bangladesh-Myanmar border. Some senior officers were present on behalf of the AA Army in this secret meeting. The Meeting reportedly made the following resolution:

 i. Kuki-Chin National Front (KNF) should be dispersed from the soil   of Bangladesh through the Arakan Army. As the price, the Bangladesh  government will pay 10 million taka to the AA army.

 ii. Arakan Army and Bangladesh Army will jointly conduct operations  against KNF. If the campaign is successful, the Bangladesh government  will provide all the necessary expenditure to the Arakan Army.
 iii. Bangladesh will allow to use its territory for Arakan Army until Arakan  becomes independent.

 On the way back from the above meeting, a high-ranking officer of the DGFI was shot dead in a sudden attack by a guerilla. According to the decision of the said agreement, on 16.11.22, about 60-70 cadres of AA army with sophisticated weapons went near Cheikhiang village to launch attack against KNA. In pursuance of the stated decision, AA cadres came towards Cheikhiang Para, and as there was no KNF member in Cheikhiang Para, they started harassing the villagers in various ways. As soon as they came to the village, they openly admitted that they had an agreement with the Bangladesh Army to fight against KNA. Some innocent villagers, including unarmed KNF members, were caught and tied up, and they were reportedly handed over to the Bangladesh Army.

 Consequence upon the alleged encounter between Bangladesh Army backed Arakan Army (AA) and Kuki Chin National Army, inside Bangladesh since 16.11.2022, villagers (mostly Bawm tribe) from Sunsong, Salopui, Thingdawl and Chhaihkhiang villages of Bangladesh had fled their villages to take shelter inside Mizoram. As many as 272 refugees entered Bandukbanga village, Lawngtlai District on 20.11.2022. The total nos. of refugees from Bangladesh who are taking shelter inside Mizoram increased to 304 as on 1st December 2022.
