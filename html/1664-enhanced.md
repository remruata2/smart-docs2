****VERIFICATION REPORT ON THE ALLEGED TRAINING OF MARA PEOPLE’s ARMY(MPA) IN CHURACHANDPUR, MANIPUR.****

Mara People’s Army (MPA) was established in 2008 in Myanmar and the leaders and volunteers were mostly citizen of Myanmar. Initially there are about 30 (thirty) volunteers in MPA and there are few volunteers from Saiha District, Mizoram. But, as of now, there are no volunteers from Mizoram in MPA.

In 2010, 13 (thirteen) cadres of MPA were trained under Zomi-Revolutionary Army (ZRA) at Songtal village, Churachandpur district, Manipur. All the 13 (thirteen) trainees from MPA left ZRA Camp in April, 2011 and ZRA gave 1 (one) AK Rifle, 1(one) M-16 and 1(one) 9mm Pistol to them.

After completion of their training, all MPA cadres from Mizoram departed from MPA. And according to our intelligence report, all the MPA cadres from Myanmar had also quit MPA in 2013.

**No report has been received on the re-organisation of MPA since 2013 and the report on **Three Months Basic Arms Training** **by MPA cadres led by S/S Capt. Thalahmo in Churachandpur** recently is found to be baseless. The leaders of Zomi-Revolutionary Army (ZRA), Chin National Front (CNF) and leaders of other Underground outfits had been contacted and none of the outfits provided training to MPA cadres. However, the report is still under constant watch to find out whether MPA has ever been reorganised by former S/S Captain of MPA, Thlahmo and his associates.**
