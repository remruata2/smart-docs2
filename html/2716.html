These events will most likely disrupt the election process thereby further forcing an issue which could result in undue delay to the schedule of holding the Mizoram State Assembly Election and at the same time, providing an exceptional leverage for the Bru leaders to reject the repatriation process agreed in the Quadri-lateral Agreement</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">.</span></span></span></span></p>
