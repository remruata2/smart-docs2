SUBMITTED TO

THE HON’BLE CHIEF MINISTER OF MIZORAM

FOR

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF KHAWZAWL DISTRICT

****BY****

****KHAWZAWL DISTRICT IMPLEMENTATION DEMAND COMMITTEE****

**A. Historical Background**

 Khawzawl was first inhabited by the Hmar sub-clan of Khawzawl and it was named after them. Khawzawl is a grouping centre wherein the following villages of were grouped together since 20thNovember, 1968 as a result of declaration of Independence by Mizo National Front:

 1) Darngawn

 2) Zaingen

 3) Tuisen

 4) Arro

 5) Zuchhip

 6) Hmuncheng

 7) Neihdawn

 8) Ngaizawl

 9) Tualpui

 10) Khualen

 The first elected Village Council came into existence in 1969, soon after grouping of villages was completed. In the first elected Village Council of Khawzawl, there were 10 elected members with Pu Darleta as its first President. As time goes by and with the growth of population, at present Khawzawl is divided into eight (8) Village Councils.

  Khawzawl was under the administration of Administrative Officer (AO) for five (5) years from September, 1969 to July, 1974. In the year 1974, Community Development Block was inaugurated in Khawzawl which is still in existence till date. Prior to establishment of Khawzawl Civil Sub-Divisional Office in March 1999, Block Development Officer was the Administrative Head and at present Khawzawl area is administered by Sub- Divisional Officer (Civil).

**B. Demography of Khawzawl DISTRICT**

 As per 2011Indiacensus, Khawzawl had a population of 11,022; of which 5,616 are males while 5,406 are females. Population of Children with age of 0-6 years is 1746 which is 15.84 % of total population of Khawzawl (NT). In Khawzawl Notified Town, Female Sex Ratio is of 963 against state average of 976. Child Sex Ratio in Khawzawl is around 938 compared to Mizoram state average of 970. Literacy rate of Khawzawl city is 96.64 % higher than state average of 91.33 %. Male literacy is around 97.39 % while female literacy is 95.86 %.As per 2011 Census there were 2,306 households.

 At present, the number of households in the proposed district area is 11,387 and the strength of population within the proposed district is also 56,133. The detail of the number of households and people living in each villages, sub-towns and towns is annexed hereto in **Annexure - I** .

_Note: 2011 Census data in respect of population of Khawzawl seems doubtful due to the fact that population of Khawzawl in 2001 Census was 10954 and the corresponding figure for 2011 census was 11022, i.e., the decadal population growth in absolute term was merely 68. Further, apart from normal population growth, there was an influx of population in Khawzawl Town as a result of inauguration of 2__nd__IR Battalion in Khawzawl in 2005. Therefore, Census figure of 2011, though official, seems unrealistic and arbitrary._

**C. Rationale for submitting memorandum**

 Being the welfare State, efficient administration to cater to the need of the people is the first and foremost thing without which all the Acts, Rules, and Regulations laid down for the benefit of the people would not serve their purposes effectively. As such District Administration was introduced in India from the pre independence era. For effective administration of the district, the location of District Headquarters really matters and in this connection mention may be made that Khawzawl has not only comparative advantage but it has an absolute advantage to be a headquarters of District Administrations. The factors which make Khawzawl as a suitable place for District Headquarters are :

**I. Location Advantage**

 Khawzawl has been envisaged as a headquarters for District administration of eastern side of Mizoram since early 1980s. Of many reasons, the most important factor is its excellent location. Khawzawl town is located at the heart of the district, not too far from every corner of the existing Champhai District.

 If a question is raised upon ‘what is good administration meant for?’ there is already a simple answer; it is for the benefit of the people. At this juncture, the suitability of Khawzawl as a District headquarters clearly emanates as the existing District Headquarters is too far from some sections of the District. Say for example, Mimbung village to the existing District Headquarters is more than 190kms which in fact is too disadvantageous for the said village. The roads connectivity’s of the District, east, west, south or north, all are linked to Khawzawl as it locates at the heart of the proposed District area.

**II. Topographical advantage**

 Khawzawl is one of the most suitable places for creating a new District Headquarters in the whole of Mizoram as far as topography is concerned. Khawzawl is a Notified Town located at 23.504696oLatitude and 93.1953853oLongitude. Presently, there are around 2800 households in Khawzawl and the vacant land (uninhabited land) in and around the town will be able to withstand for more than five folds the existing number of households. In other words, the landscape and countryside permits the growth of the existing town at least by five times.

**III. Availability of vacant land for establishing government offices**

 District administration has many subordinate offices. For the opening of these offices, the most apparent prerequisite is availability of lands which are easily accessible to general public. Khawzawl will be able to provide all the lands required for establishing various district offices which will be a big problem in other places/townships.

**IV. Geographical boundary of the proposed district is well defined**

 The geographical area of the proposed District is well defined. It is proposed to be comprising of Tuichang and Lengteng Constituencies as well as part of Champhai North, Tuikum and Hrangturzo Assembly Constituencies. The proposed map of Khawzawl District are shown in **Annexure- II (1) & (2) respectively.**

**V. Existing Government Offices**

 The existing Govt offices within Khawzawl town are already District level offices and much up gradation will be required. Khawzawl is Sub-Divisional Headquarters in Civil Administration and is also Block Headquarters. As of now, there are three (3) offices which have been functioning in the capacity of the district level, namely they are Soil &amp; Water Conservation Department, Jawahar Navodaya Vidhialaya and Krishi Vigya Kendra (KVK). Apart from these offices, there are five (5) Division level offices within Khawzawl town namely; PWD, PHE, P&amp;E, Environment &amp; Forest (Wildlife), Horticulture. In addition to the aforementioned offices, There are also Sub- Divisional Offices of Agriculture, Minor Irrigation and Education, Police Department etc. Khawzawl is also a Headquarter of 2ndIR Battalion. The Details of Govt. offices in Khawzawl are annexed at **Annexure – III**.

**VI. Development of Town Infrastructures**

 Good road connectivity already in existence in Khawzawl and proper planning of town will not be a big problem as Khawzawl is topographically flat which makes it an ideal place for conducting proper town planning. The mindset of the people is also very conducive to development as Khawzawl may be the best town in Mizoram in terms of encroachment of public land which is evident from the fact that those who newly construct residential buildings moved away from the existing road without any compulsion from Govt. Authorities.

**VII. Availability of Raw Materials**

 Good quality construction materials such as good quality stones, sands, water resources, etc. required for building requisite infrastructures of District Administration and its subordinate offices are found in abundance in and around Khawzawl town and in the near surrounding area of the town which make the town a suitable place for District Headquarters.

**VIII.Cost Efficiency**

 Establishing new District Headquarters will involve huge amount of fund which will be a huge burden for the State’s economy to a large extent. However, it is obvious from the aforementioned point that additional expenditure required for establishing District Headquarters and its subordinate Offices will be very much lower than fund required for creating District in other places thereby bringing cost efficiency for the State Government.

**IX. Availability of land already earmarked for District Administration**

 Consequent upon declaration of Mizoram as a disturbed area, Assam Rifles established their Camp at Khawzawl which is located on top of the Mualvawm hill. When normalcy was maintained as a result of signing Memorandum of Understanding between the MNF and the Govt. of India, Assam Rifles left their camp at Khawzawl which is still kept vacant for establishing District Administration Office. Needless to say its location advantage, no extra cost is needed to pay for land acquisition.

**X. Maintenance of Law and Order:**

 One of the most decisive advantage embedded to Khawzawl as a District Headquarters will be maintenance of law and order. As mentioned earlier, 2ndIR Battalion Headquarters is already located in Khawzawl which will be easily mobilised by the District Administration as and when necessary. Besides, SDPO Khawzawl with well established infrastructures will be easily upgraded so that maintenance of law and order within the proposed District will not be a matter of great concern whenever security threats and other untoward incidences occur.

**D. Aspirations of Khawzawl people**

 Needless to say the tragic incident that shed tears in the eyes of people of Khawzawl town in 1997 as a result of shifting the District Headquarters from Khawzawl to other location, the expectations of Khawzawl people to Government of Mizoram to inaugurate Khawzawl District never fades away and we will never shy away to bring our aspirations to the notice of State Government to make Khawzawl District functional. The fact is that Khawzawl was envisaged as the Headquarters for Eastern Mizoram since early 1980’s and reportedly Administrative Reforms Commission was constituted which recommended Khawzawl as a District Headquarters. However, such recommendations of the Commission had not been reportedly accepted by Government.

 With the passage of time, Government of Mizoram, General Administration Department recently issued Notification for constitution of District Reorganisation Committee (vide No. 60012/3/2011-GAD dt. 16. 6. 2016) to look into creation of new Districts in Mizoram including reorganisation of boundaries of Districts/Sub-Divisions. As it came to notice of Khawzawl District Implementation Demand Committee (KDIDC), it was felt that this is an appropriate moment to bring our never ending desires and aspirations to the knowledge of authorities of Government of Mizoram. At the same time, we also felt that a new opportunity has come to light for the people that implementation of Khawzawl as a new District Headquarters which has long been eagerly awaited by us is in its culmination stage. Therefore, the Khawzawl District Implementation Committee, on behalf of the people of Khawzawl and its proposed District area with full enthusiasm, decided to submit our Memorandum to Government of Mizoram. It is the expectation of KDIDC that the State Government Authority will graciously be pleased listen to our humble prayers and benevolently treat our Memorandum so as to realise the desires and expectations of the people.

**E. Support by other villages/sub-towns/towns of the proposed Khawzawl District**

 The decision of Khawzawl District Implementation Demand Committee to submit Memorandum to Chief Minister of Mizoram is not only appreciated by the people of Khawzawl alone, but also by the people of almost all villages within the proposed new District. We therefore want to let our parent Government aware that our efforts in a way of implementing Khawzawl District are not done baselessly, arbitrarily and ambiguously. The decision taken by the KDIDC to submit the Memorandum to the Chief Minister of Mizoram is wholeheartedly supported, acknowledge and appreciated by the villages, sub-towns and towns within the proposed District area. The letters of support given by other villages, sub-towns and towns are attached in **Annexure – IV.**
