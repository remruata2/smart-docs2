**The Free Movement Regime (FMR) along the Indo-Myanmar Border****:**

 Mizoram shares a 510-kilometer-long border with Myanmar, which remains unfenced and porous. Six districts in the state adjoin the international border, with Champhai district sharing the longest border with Myanmar.

 The Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that enables citizens of both countries to travel freely within a 16-kilometer radius of the border for up to 72 hours without the need for a visa. This initiative aims to preserve traditional ties and alleviate insecurity for tribal communities residing along the border.

 The FMR spans 1,629.5 kilometers of unfenced border shared between four Indian states - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram - and Myanmar. In January 2018, the Union Cabinet approved a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance economic interactions through this regime.

**Border Fencing and Free Movement Regime Abolition******:

 On February 28, 2024, the Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Indian government’s proposal to build a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and to abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR). Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution expresses concerns that these measures would negatively impact the Zo ethnic communities, which have been historically divided by the border established during British colonial rule. The Assembly contends that strengthening this division with additional barriers would disturb the livelihoods and social connections of the border communities.

1. **Narcotics drugs smuggling trends/Opium cultivation in Chin State and possible nexus among IIGs**

The modus operandi and ways of concealment of smuggled narcotics used by smugglers is constantly evolving. The past seizures of narcotics in the state revealed that these drugs are often concealed in sealed food packages, vegetables, electrical goods and more commonly inside a car door panel or costumed concealed compartment inside a vehicle. Further, the emerging trend of using end to end encrypted messaging applications and compartmentalizing activities like logistics, finances or intelligence gathering by different groups or units complicated the interception of modern narcotics syndicates.

During this year till April, 2025, most of the drugs seized i.e. 80 % (approx.) are destined to Assam and other outerstate whereas 20 % (approx.) are destined for local consumption which are mostly transported from Myanmar.

**29.04.2025 :** CID (SB) operation party, acting on intelligence collected, conducted operation along the stretch between Tuirial and Zemabawk, intercepted two vehicle car at Zemabawk North, near Presbyterian Zemabawk North Church at around 11:30AM. The vehicles were thoroughly checked and recovered and seized 49 bundles (47.511 kgs) of suspected Methamphetamine tablets v/o Rs.6,17,64,300/-(approx). 20 bundles were recovered from inside the rear body lining and dashboard beam of KIA Seltos car B/R No. MZ 01 AD 6157 driven by Samuela (38) s/o Hrangluta (L) of Champhai Vengthlang. 29 bundles recovered from inside the rear body lining and dashboard beam of KIA Sonet car B/R No. MZ 01 AC 3237 driven by T. Vancheuliana (37) s/o Thangchhunga of Champhai Vengthlang.
