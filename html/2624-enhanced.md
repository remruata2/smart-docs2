****Investigation Report****

 Searching of the residence of one Suidemi d/o Chhunzova of Tlangsam by Champhai Police resulted in the recovery of the above listed arms and ammunitions and the arrest of Vanlalmawia s/o Vepe of Pasai, Myanmar while his friend and co-accused Lalhmingthanga absconded.

 Interrogation of the accused Vanlalmawia revealed that his friend, the other accused person, Lalhmingthanga brought the consignment to Tlangsam a few days earlier and they decided to keep it in the house of Suidemi D/o Chhunzova of Tlangsam on her permission for safe-keeping.

 

 He did not know from where Lalhmingthanga acquired the arms and ammunitions or to where he intended to proceed with. He assumed that the consignment was to be taken to camp Victoria (located at Saiha District in Mizoram which was demolished on 21.6.2005), which was the nearest CNA camp from Tlangsam, Champhai District.

 It appears that Suidemi was an innocent victim who permitted the safe keeping of the consignment not knowing that it was arms and ammunitions and that it was illegal.

**PREVIOUS DEALING OR INVOLVEMENT:**No previous involvement****was known.
