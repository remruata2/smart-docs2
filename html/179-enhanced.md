Subject  : Assessment of threat perception ( Pi Silvie Zomuanpuii Ralte, Chief Judicial  Magistrate, Aizawl District)

Reference : MSB/CB/B-19(A)/07/405  Dated Aizawl the 13th May 2015

Sir,

 In pursuance of the above mention reference order No. and subject, assessment was conducted and the findings of my report are as under-

Mrs. Sylvia Zomuanpuii Ralte has been holding the post of Chief Judicial Magistrate of Aizawl District for more than a year. Ever since she was appointed to this designation, as usual, various criminal cases – petty, small , serious and sensational cases of Aizawl District has been dealt by her. As per Court procedure, all the criminal cases are put up before her where she again transferred them to other appropriate Judges and Magistrates for trail.

 So far, during her term, serious cases such as the issuing of warrant of arrest of top leaders of HPC(D) including the Chairman, Zosangbera have been done .Apart from this ,as mentioned earlier, hardcore criminals accused of murder, rape, extortion, kidnapping ,robbery, theft etc. are brought to her ,who sometimes, without knowing the actual Judge who convicted them, gave her threatening remarks. In one instance, there was a report of one drunken person causing trouble inside her Court when brought before her.

 At the moment, no immediate threat is found to exist against her and she herself could not mention any in particular. At the same time, she confessed how it was sometimes uncomfortable to pass a sentence of punishment especially if it was related to any militancy.

Considering the above circumstances and the nature of her job as a female Chief Judicial Magistrate, it may be wise to provide her with a suitable Personal Security Officer (PSO) for her to conduct her judgments fairly and in confidence. After all, even her predecessors were also provided with adequate PSO before.
