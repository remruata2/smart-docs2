No.MSB/CB/SR/2020/155

Dated: 16th March, 2020.

 Information has been received that on 13.3.2020 an altercation occurred between some youths of Lungpuk, Siaha District and Ralie (Myanmar). As per input, there was blockade on border crossing at Mizoram-Myanmar border which connects the two villages due to the spread of COVID-19. The said ban on border crossing was enforced and manned by MADC Forest Guards deployed at the border check-gate. On 12.3.2020, around 10 (ten) youths from Ralie tried to enter into Mizoram through the check-gate to collect Banana Leaves for Wedding Feast but were prevented by the Forest Guards. In anger and frustration they shook the check-gate at around 4:00 p.m and they later came again at around 9:00 p.m and did the same again. Out of apprehension, the Forest Guards went to Lungpuk on foot and intimated the matter to VC of Lungpuk and 4 (four) persons were sent from Lungpuk to Check-gate to enquire into the matter. Since they did not return the same night, VC leaders of Lungpuk out of anxiety made public announcement on the morning of 13.3.2020 wherein all available abled youths numbering around 100 (one hundred) proceeded to the Check-gate. The 4 (four) persons sent the previous night were also found safely at the Check-gate. There was some scuffle between spirited youths of both sides, but no major untoward incident occurred. 2 (two) police personnel deployed at Lungpuk for border sealing also proceeded along with the Lungpuk residents on 13.3.2020 and played their part in controlling the situation. O/C Phura PS also reached the spot on early morning of 14.3.2020 and MTP leaders on both sides also reached an agreement and normalcy returned.

 In another incident, information has been received that on 15.3.2020 @ 1:30 p.m, an altercation occurred between some residents of Siasi, Siaha District and Lochei (Myanmar) at the bank of Kolodyne river wherein border crossing blockade was enforced by MTP due to outbreak of COVID-19. 1 (one) person, namely, Mato (Mapaw) who intends to visit his sister who resides at Siasi due to marriage was prevented from crossing the border and as a result he called upon in anger around 20 (twenty) of his friends from Lochei. These youths created ruckus at the check-gate by disturbing MTP youths who were on duty and pulled down posters banning cross-border movement. They further went to Siasi village and created fuss, but VC leaders managed to persuade them to go back to their village. On hearing the above incident, community leaders of Lochei proceeded to Siasi as emissaries and expressed their regret over the incident. A truce was made between the 2 (two) villages and no further untoward incident occurred. Dy. SP (Hqrs.), Siaha DEF and party immediately proceeded for Siasi last night, i.e., 15.3.2020 to take stock of the situation.

  Situation is under close watch.
