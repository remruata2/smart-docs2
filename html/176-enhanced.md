Subject :  Assessment of threat perception ( Pu L.Hrangnawna, State Information Commissioner)

Reference:  MSB/CB/B-19(A)/07/405  Dated Aizawl the 13th May 2015

Sir,

 In pursuance of the above mention reference order No. and subject, assessment was conducted and the findings of my report are as under-

At present, no immediate threat is found to exist against Mr.L.Hrangnawna, State Information Commissioner. However, the Department in which he holds this post is functioning as a quasi-judicial institution where complaints are submitted to them by citizens who seek information about the functioning of the Government and are not satisfied with the results. This often resulted in punishment awarded to certain SPIO who did not provide adequate information to the public.

 Although no threat could be detected at the moment, there is also a possibilities of someone bearing a personal grudge against the Commission or its Commissioner by any Government personnel, who are punished or defamed as a result of the information provided through this Commission.

 As a precautionary security measure, no other efforts needed be carried out apart from the continuation of the two PSO already provided to Pu L.Hrangnawna, which will be quiet sufficient at the present situation.
