<p style="margin-left:-19px; margin-right:-13px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The Bru National Union ( BNU) conference held in September, 1997 at Saipuilui village in Mamit District adopted a resolution for creation of Autonomous District Council for Brus in the western part of Mizoram which was strongly objected by the Mizo community in the concerned area. At the same time a militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) which was formed in 1996 under the leadership of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district. It became more and more active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news about the killing had spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the prevailing tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by BNU. Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram at the instance of the BNLF for their operational convenience.</span></span></p>

While all preparations for repatriation process were going on smoothly, a Bru militant group who called themselves the Bru Revolutionary Union (BRU) killed a Mizo youth on 13th November, 2009. It was later confirmed that killing was done deliberately by the Bru, who were instigated by the refugee leaders, in order to deter the repatriation process.</span></span></p>
