Yours faithfully,

****VERIFICATION REPORT****

 Investigation was conducted to locate the residence of one person who called himself as Mawia Hmar so as to verify his identities.

 However, after pursuing the address given by him, it was learnt that his given address – N.Lung Village of Aizawl District, Mizoram was nowhere to be found. In this regard, the official records of Deputy Commissioner of Aizawl District, Local Administration Department, Postal Department and Public Works Department were thoroughly checked for the said village but to no avail.

 On the other hand, assuming there can be spelling error on the part of the given address, N.Lungleng Village; the nearest possible name to the given address was also checked. According to reliable inhabitants of N.Lungleng Village, there is no such person named Mawia Hmar in their village. The house number given by him, H/No. 91 is nowhere near any PWD quarters in N.Lungleng Village, which proved that he is not from N.Lungleng Village. Likewise, other Villages like Lungsei, Lungpher and East Lungdar Villages were also checked without any positive results.

 As the investigation could not see much progress, the village of N. Lungleng was again scrutinized (in case there is spelling mistake on the part of the given address).Even former inhabitants, who had left the village, were also considered. This resulted in the uncovering of one person – Chawiliana, former residence of N. Lungleng village.

 Chawiliana S/o Lalhleia was born in N.Lungleng village. He left the village more than 20 years ago to pursue further studies and profession. He served as an evangelist in Tripura under Seventh Day Adventist for a couple of years before studying and completing B.D from ATS, Jowai, Meghalaya. However, as he had been already over-aged, he could not pursue pastoral job under Seventh Day Adventist Church and now runs a small business shop at Vaivakawn. Presently, he and his family are residing in a rented flat belonging to Pastor Biakthansanga at Vaivakawn.

 During the course of an interview, Mr. Chawiliana claimed that, while he was serving in Tripura as an evangelist, he once came across this type of radiation emitting items, probably left behind by Imperial British during their occupation. According to him, being an evangelist, he collected all the relevant information to curb villagers from scaring each other with tales relating to the pillar. He became extremely interested in this issue. He even mentioned that he had visited different places in Mizoram where these pillars are said to exist, but without any success.

 Although no evidence could be established in respect of Mr.Chawiliana, there is a possibility that he might be using part of his younger brother name's H.Lalrimawia (as Mawia Hmar since H stands for Hmar).Besides, both of them are hailing from N.Lungleng village,which is the nearest possible name to the village given in the address. On the other hand, it can only be a mere coincidence, as the house No. given i.e. 91 (assuming it is from N.Lungleng) belongs to Mr.Lalzidinga while the House No. of Chawiliana (presently occupied by his parents) is 146.

 When the subject of an application, submitted by a person with a vaguely mentioned address, for permission to collect radiation emitting objects was raised, he strongly denied of knowing the person. He also totally denied submitting any such application himself or using part of his brother's name. He however, added his willingness to pursue this business if such permission could be granted by the government.

 His brother, H. Lalrimawia when contacted, denied of his involvement nor knew about this issue, In fact, he is presently residing in Kohima, Nagaland, practicing law after marrying one Naga lady.

 It is evident that, the applicant, whosoever he is, cannot be considered as genuine since his name and address cannot be ascertained at the moment. He had given an entirely wrong address using a village in Aizawl district which do not exist. It is likely that any acknowledgement which may be forwarded will not reach him at all in his given address. Due to the above circumstances, the applicant may be considered as an imposter which cannot be taken as legitimate.
