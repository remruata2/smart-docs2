****INTERROGATION STATEMENT OF ZUTOVI SEMA****

**I, alongwith other 15 cadres of NSCN(IM) under the leadership of SS 2nd Lt. Tali Ao, after completing 4 months training at Punglu in Dimapur District started our journey to Bangladesh during April 2004.**

**We reached Aizawl via Guwahati by availing Night Super buses. We hired two vehicles(Sumo) from Aizawl and reached a village called Rolui in Bangladesh and were taken to Bethel Camp of NSCN(IM) in which SS Capt. Kingkui was the commander. There were about 20-30 cadres in the camp at that time.**

**Arms holding**

**1. AK-46 - 3**

**2. AK-56 - 8**

**3. Sniper Rifle - 2**

**4. Semi-Automatic Rifle - 2**

**I was in the Bethel Camp for two years and after that I was detailed to collect taxes/donations at Garo Hills, Meghalaya under the command of SS Capt. Among Tikher. We had collected mainly from those dealing business in coal and charcoal. Our modus operandi was that we used to serve demand letters to them and they themselves gave us the amount demanded without complain. We were there for about 2 years and returned to Bangladesh and reported before SS Capt. Among. After about a month, we were taken to ZION CAMP in which SS Lt. Ahomi Tangkhul was the commander.**

****During our stay in Zion Camp, some of us requested our leaders for going to Nagaland and visit our homes and families which they flatly denied. Some arguments had also arisen from that subject. There were about 31 cadres of NSCN(IM) including me in Zion Camp those days. Our arms holding are: 1) AK-66 =2nos. 2) AK-56 = 1no. and 300 ammns.****

**On 29.1.2010 evening, there was once again an argument amongst us which ensued in killing of four of our comrades (not sure the number) who opposed to our trip to Nagaland. Then I, along with the following fled to the jungles:- 1) SS Cpl. Auaway 2) SS L/Cpl. Aio 3) SS L/Cpl. Mokado 4) SS L/Cpl. Akim 5) SS L/Cpl. Maya 6) SS Cpl. Wangcho.**

**We had decamped from Zion Camp with arms and some amount of money. Our foremost aim was to cross the international boundary and surrender to whichever security forces available or to the Police.**

**Wandering in the jungle since 29.1.2010 we entered into a Bawm village on 30.1.2010 but as we dared not stay there we once again entered in the jungle and kept on hiding till 6.2.2010. We were given food by the Bawms and in exchange we gave them money.**

**On 7.1.2010 we had splited into two groups as we thought would be more safe, as follows:**

**Group-I 1) SS Cpl. Zatovi (Self)**

**2) SS Cpl. Akim**

**3) SS L/Cpl. Maya**

**4) SS L/Cpl. Mokado**

**Group-II 1) SS Cpl. Awang**

**2) SS L/Cpl. Aio**

**3) SS Cpl. Wangcho**

**After splitting and while we were walking in the jungle, we were ambushed by our comrades we left in the camp and three of my colleagues in our group (group-I) I thought, were killed and I somehow survived. Then I once again started wandering in the jungle. My day to day activities from 8-12 Feb, 2010 may be summarized as under:-**

| **Dt. 8.2.2010** | **-** | **Entered Salupi, Bangladesh.**  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dt. 9.2.2010** | **-** | **Halted at Salupi.**  |
| **Dt. 10.2.2010** | **-** | **Engaged local porter and taken to a village in Tripura.**  |
| **Dt. 11.2.2010** | **-** | **Taken by a person of that locality to the camp of Arakan Liberation Party at Indo-Bangla border and apprised them of what had happened.**  |
| **Dt. 12.2.2010** | **-** | **Taken to 40 AR Camp, Parva by one member of ALP and told them my willingness to surrender to them.** |


**The AR authority then handed over me to the Mizoram Police and I was taken to Lawngtlai Police Station on 14.2.2010. A case was registered against me at the said Police Station u/s 121A IPC(vide LTI P.S C/No. 13/10 dt. 15.2.2010 u/s 121A IPC).**

**I was without arms while I surrendered and left my weapon at the time we were ambushed by our comrades.**
