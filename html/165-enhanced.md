Subj  : Threat Perception Report pendency - reg.

Ref : MSB/CB/B-19(A)/241 Dated 05.04.2019

Sir,

 With reference to the letter no. and subject cited above, I am submitting the reasons of my pendency of assessment of security threat perception report in respect of Pu Vanlalmawia, Addl. District &amp; Sessions Judge.

It may be mentioned here that, the delay in the submission of the threat perception report was mainly due to the fact that the petitioner could not be interviewed at the earliest as he was engaged in his different cases. Since it being a threat perception case, a telephonic interview was not convenient but a mutual set date for the interview however could not be fixed due to his busy schedule, though he himself stated that it would be convenient to have a personal interview to assess the threat perception. As he was unable to give a fixed appointment date for his interview since the coming days are holidays for the High Court on account of Bihu and Good Friday, therefore the assessment of threat perception is done through telephone in the last minute.

 Yours faithfully,

 SI (KC. JOSEPH VANLALPEKA)
