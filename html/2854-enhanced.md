MZP Gen. Hqrs. issued a Press Release today, i.e. 10.12.2019 and expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the people of Mizoram for their support. The PR condemned Pu C. Lalrosanga, MP (Lok Sabha) for his support of the Bill in the Lok Sabha and expressed their fear that his action may lead to instability of the unity between Mizoram and other Northeastern states. The PR further urged the MP to remember the opinion of the MZP, NESO and the people of Northeastern states regarding CAB and to change his opinion. The PR reiterated their opinion of a mere exclusion of 3 (three) states of the Northeast having ILP and the Sixth Schedule from CAB is not enough and there is still a need to strive for safeguarding land, nation and religion. They further invited the people of Mizoram to know the importance of maintaining unity with the other Northeastern states.
