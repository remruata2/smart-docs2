Subject: Report on Assessment of security threat perception

 (Through the proper channel)

Ref:  No. MSB/CB/B-19(A)/508 dt. 14.8.2018

Sir,

 With reference to the above cited letter number, a comprehensive security threat assessment for NIT, Mizoram was conducted by self as directed. It may be recollected that on 27.7.2018, an incident had occurred at NIT, Mizoram, Aizawl where few members of MSU Gen. Hqrs. destroyed some office properties of NIT, Mizoram due to misunderstanding arose between NIT officials and members of MSU General Headquarters, Aizawl on the said day which was however long settled without further imbroglio between the two party. During furtherance verification process, it was learnt that present direct or indirect threat as well as intimidation of any kind from individual or organization were not heard after the above mentioned incident. It may also be noted that the only possible threat for the said institution is that if its own students i.e. Mizo students of NIT, Mizoram submit a complaint to the MSU Gen. Hqrs., which is unlikely to be happened.

Considering the above mentioned points, it was concluded that since direct or indirect threat as well as intimidation of any kind were not known from any source, provision of personal security guard for NIT, Mizoram is not necessary for the time being.

.

  Yours faithfully,

Dated, Aizawl the 23rd August, 2018  Inspr. (P. VANLALRUATA)
