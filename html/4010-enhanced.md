****Notes on Entry/Exit Points****

Various pressing challenges and recommendations that required immediate attention while implementing entry/exit points along the Indo-Myanmar Border (IMB) are as mentioned below:

**Challenges:**

**Shortage of Manpower resources**: The various challenges in infrastructural and manpower sectors faced by District administrations have been highlighted that impeded the implementation of entry-exit points. Owing to the current status, the District Administration considered deployment of Police Personnel and Health Officials at the Pilot sites of Entry/Exit Points not feasible without deployment of additional resources.

 Likewise, Assam Rifles faced the same challenges as that of the District Administrations that without additional resources implementing entry/exit points would be difficult.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Notifying villages lying within the 10 Kms of IMB**: There is confusion amongst the enforcement agencies as well as foreigners entering India as to the limit they are legally permitted to travel. To resolve this confusion, it is recommended that relevant authorities of both countries notify all villages/towns lying within the permitted 10 kilometres of the Indo-Myanmar border. There are 6 (six) administrative districts bordering Myanmar in Mizoram and authority/ies must promptly identify and officially notify these villages within 10 kilometres of the border. Entry permits should be restricted to individual visitors of notified border villages only.

****b)** **Deposition of IDs etc**: It is learnt from experience that many foreign visitors that reported their entry into India are either overstaying or cross the border through alternative routes while returning, which resulted to increased report of overstayal. To ensure that these foreign visitors cross the border from the same entry/exit point, it is considered necessary to require them to deposit their valid identification documents (e.g., for Myanmar nationals, the Hmat Pung Tin, their primary ID) while issue Border Pass. This measure will help ensure that visitors return through the same route to retrieve their deposited IDs, preventing them from exiting through unauthorized channels.**

****c) Mandatory activated SIM**: To ensure traceability of overstaying visitors, it is recommended that only visitors with valid and activated SIM are issued passed at the Entry/Exit Points. All details of the contact numbers from visitors shall be checked before issuing Border Pass. It will be the duty of officials on duty at the Entry/Exit Points to report the details of overstaying foreigners on a daily basis to Foreigners’ Tracking Cell.**

****d) Establishment of Foreigners’ Tracking Cell**: There should be a foreigners tracking Cell established in each border Police Stations under the supervision of Officer-in-Charge (OC). They will be tasked to identify and locate all overstaying foreigners in their respective jurisdictions based on the daily report from the Entry/ Exit Points. On locating such foreigners, it will be their duty to send them to the concerned Entry/Exit Points from where they entered India.**

**e) Generating Awareness Programmes**: Develop a continuous and effective awareness program targeting residents of both side of the countries lying within 10 kilometers of the border. Awareness campaigns may utilize written materials, videos, reels, or shorts on social media, disseminated in 3 (three) languages: English, Mizo, and Myanmarese. Displaying key points at permit-issuing sites in English, Mizo, and Burmese, Circulate essential SOP details through local media and social media groups. Engage local NGOs and public representatives through a district-level sub-committee to enhance awareness efforts.

**f) Software Technology Solutions:**

i)  It is proposed that the software version be upgraded to enable tracking of visitors, to enable entry of place of stay, sponsor details etc and automated notification to alert the visitors duration of stay.

ii) An automated report generation system may be implemented to track overstaying persons. This report may be electronically shared with law enforcement agencies and may contain traceable details such as the visitor's address in India, sponsor details, contact number, and photograph.

iii) An automated notification system may be introduced to send SMS, WhatsApp, or IVRS messages to visitors who are still in India on the fifth day of their visit. These messages may remind them to return their border passes and inform them about the legal implications of overstaying. Once the seven-day period expires, daily reminders may be sent until the individual exits.

iv)  The software may be modified to streamline the renewal process. The requirement to recapture biometric data for the re-issuance of passes may be eliminated to expedite the process.

v)  An Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) may be deployed at all 10 km crossing points. This may help track overstaying individuals and enforce the 10 km travel limit more effectively.

****

****g) Policy-Related Solutions**: 8-point policy subject proposal was highlighted for communication with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Government of India as mentioned below:**

i)  Introduction of security deposit at the time of issuing of pass

ii)  Simplifying of penalties for overstaying: Enforceable penalties may be specified for overstaying individuals. These may include fines, blacklisting, or other legal consequences.

iii) Relaxing the fixed 7 days visit period: Instead of issuing a fixed seven-day pass, visitors may be required to specify the number of days they intend to stay within a prescribed limit. This may help reduce the high percentage of unnecessary pass renewals.

iv)  Organising joint inspection of designated border crossing points by stakeholders.

v)  Formulating a uniform SOP for all agencies involved to reduce confusion.

vi) Proof of Identity (PoI): be issued by civil authorities instead SHO/Village authorities that maintain updated records of residents in a given area to ensure greater reliability.

vii)  Excluding tourism as the purpose of entry etc. as it is difficult to collect sponsor or local contact details for such visitors

viii) A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) may be established for  responding to exigencies following medical screenings at the border.
**h) Logistical Upgradation**:

1. The strengthening deployment of police personnel in border areas to enhance surveillance and enforcement capabilities for better regulation of cross-border movement and in preventing unauthorized stay.

ii)  Adequate provision of essential equipment such as computers, scanners, printers, USB drives, and mobile phones may be made to facilitate electronic data storage, analysis, and monitoring of individuals crossing the border.

iii)  Dedicated mobile phones may be provided to enforcement agencies for making phone calls to track individuals overstaying beyond the permitted period. This may allow real-time verification and communication with overstaying individuals, their sponsors, or relevant authorities to ensure compliance.

iv)  The budget for Petrol, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) may be increased to accommodate the anticipated rise in enforcement activities, such as tracking and monitoring overstaying individuals, patrolling border areas, and facilitating prompt responses to violations.
