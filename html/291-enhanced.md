 During the course of enquiry, Pu Lalsawma, Joint Director (Food &amp; Drugs), Controlling &amp; Licensing Authority, Food &amp; Drugs Administration Wing, Health &amp; Family Welfare Department, Mizoram was contacted and he opined that since Mizoram is a peaceful state as compared to other States, provision of security at the office of Drugs Inspector is unnecessary, but if possible during raids, security be provided to perform sensitive nature of duties.

 It was also learnt that meeting of Drug Inspectors was held on 10th May, 2019, at the office chamber of Pu Lalsawma, with reference to a letter received from AIDCOC (All India Drugs Controls Officers Confederation), for ensuring safety of Drugs Control Officers.
