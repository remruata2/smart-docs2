No. MSB/CB/SR/2020/592

Dated: 22nd October, 2020

  As per input, Mizo IR Bn. Duty Post set up in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic at Vairengte Auto rickshaw Stand, Vairengte-Assam border, was shifted today, i.e., 22.10.2020 @ 8:30 a.m. to Lailapur Auto rickshaw Stand, which is approximately 50 mtrs towards Vairengte. The said shifting of Duty Post has evoked strong opposition and criticisms from various quarters, especially, Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP), Vairengte Thalai Pawl, Vairengte Joint VC and Vairengte Community. The move was seen as an act of ‘back down’ of the State Government from its earlier stand and ‘withdrawal’ from its claim on the State’s territory.

 In this connection, MZP General Headquarters convened its Emergency Meeting today and subsequently issued a Press Release wherein it strongly condemned shifting of the above Police Duty Post and demanded the Government to re-deploy Armed Force in the previous position.

 Considering the seriousness of the current border issues with Assam and the heightened emotions of the general public of Mizoram at large and huge support and concerns it received from outside the State, it is pertinent to mention that any act of withdrawal of security force deployed at Mizoram-Assam border, particularly at Vairengte area, can lead to serious law and order problems at this juncture and another mobilization of general public with whatever available weapons/arms cannot be ruled out. Any act that can be perceived or seen as an act of retreat on the part of Mizoram Government vis-à-vis protection of its border needs to be done with all caution.

 In view of the above, it is strongly suggested that Mizo Armed Police Personnel should continue to be deployed at its earlier position, i.e., Vairengte Auto rickshaw Stand and any move for shifting of Security Duty Post should be done after taking into account the prevailing situation and all possible outcome and necessary prior consultation may be held with NGOs/Civil Society, if deemed necessary.

 Situation is under close watch.
