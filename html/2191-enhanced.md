**Sir,**

****With reference to the above subject and Home department letter, I am sending herewith the required information as under for further necessary action.****

****A five day long training on civil society based organisation organized by Chin National Council (CNC) was held on dt.21.6.2010 - dt.25.6.2010 at Archive Hall, Babutlang, Aizawl. The main purpose of this training is to form an NGO in the Chin State of Myanmar and some part of Myanmar plain area to act as a non- political organisation for all Chin Communities which would be functioning somewhat like Young Mizo Association (a/non political organisation) in Mizoram state. The training was attended by selected personalities from various communities within Chin State of Myanmar and 32 delegates attended the training. The training was sponsored by New Delhi based donor Agency "National Reconciliatory Program".****

**The following CNC leaders gave lecture to the trainees**

**1. Ralhnina - Gen. Secy.**

**2. Thanglianpianga - Jt. Gen. Secy.**

**3. Lalhmangaihzual i - Jt Gen Secy. CNC**

**4. Lalzenghaki - WLC**

**5. Khera uk Lian - CNF (Invitee)**

****During the training, there had been no discussion/lectures about Myanmar politics. However, the CNC held a meeting on dt.30.5.2010 at their office, Upper Republic, Aizawl and decided to boycott the forthcoming Myanmar election as they did not expect free and fair election under military Junta.****

**As desired by MHA, VISA Regulation and Protected Area Permit regime may be more strictly enforced and it is also suggested that full fledged Integrated Check Posts (ICP) may be established along Indo - Myanmar border at the earliest.**
