****Corporation, board and Societies not to recruit staff**: As per an Office Memorandum issued by Mizoram Finance Department, various Corporations, Boards and Societies under Mizoram Government are instructed not to recruit any new staffs by their own, without obtaining prior approval from finance department. According to the memorandum, these corporations and Boards often created additional posts by their own with the consent of their respective Governing Board which resulted in the need to allot additional funds to them. The memorandum highlighted how these additional funds created financial problems for Mizoram Finance department and failure to comply to this memorandum will result in non allotments of funds for their salaries.**
