2. Completed excavation works (earthwork) for foundation of 3 (three) Watch Towers and View Points.

It may be mentioned that Mizo residents of Phuldungsei and Zampui hill range approached Mizoram State government on several occasions to construct/develop government infrastructures at the area. Input received stated that residents of Phuldungsei village have no intention to oppose the above stated construction of infrastructural development works undertaken by Tripura government as the same will bring benefits to residents of the area and as no action regarding development/construction of developmental works has been initiated by Mizoram government. Leaders of Phuldungsei village expressed their desire for Mizoram government to take initiative for construction of infrastructural development projects. At the same time, they would not oppose any developmental works undertaken at the area by either State as the same would yield benefits to them.

In connection with the above infrastructural development projects undertaken by Tripura Tourism Development Corporation Ltd., 4 (four) leaders of MZP led by Pu Andrew F. Lalramnghaka, Vice President MZP met Pu Lalchamliana, Home Minister at the latter’s Office Chamber yesterday i.e., 4.5.2022 @ 3:30 p.m. During the meeting, leaders of MZP raised their opposition of the reported infrastructural development projects undertaken by Tripura government and the need to develop and strengthen IR personnel posted at the inter-state border. They also expressed their desire that the State government should immediately look into the matter.
Recapping earlier development, it may be mentioned that the standoff between Tripura and Mizoram over Phuldungsei Village in the Zampui Hill range, started in August, 2020 when Tripura Administration identified that 130 (one hundred thirty) people living in Phuldungsei Village were registered in electoral roll, ration card and other public welfare benefit schemes under both states. Later, Tripura claimed Phuldungsei and adjoining parts (Thaidawr Tlang) as parts of Tripura.

The tension flared up after an announcement made by SONGRONGMA, a conglomerate of various Bru associations within Tripura regarding their intention to construct a Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr Tlang, Phuldungsei and organize community activities in the area on 19th to 20th October, 2020. The same was strongly opposed by Mizo Students Union (MSU) and Mizo Convention, Tripura.

Further, Zampui Mizo Convention (MC), Tripura held an Executive Meeting on 13.10.2020 @ 7:00 p.m. at Behliangchhip Branch YMA Hall. Rev. David Ralte, President, MC chaired the meeting and 26 (twenty six) members attended the meeting. During the meeting, Bru SONGRONGMA’s intention to construct Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr Tlang, Phungdungsei, Mizoram during 19th to 20th October, 2020 was deliberated and resolved the following :-

1. Condemned the intention of Bru Hindu Association to construct Shiv. Mandir within Phuldungsei VC (Mizo village) area and considered it as utter disregard of the Mizo people.
2. The matter will be brought to the notice of Tripura Government with a request to prohibit the said initiative.
3. Total Bandh will be called on 19 to 20.10.2020 under the aegis of Mizo Convention within Zampui area.

In view of the above development, DC, Mamit issued prohibitory orders u/s 144 CrPC in and around the village to prevent any untoward incident and maintain order at the area. The prohibitory order was contested by Tripura on grounds of administrative jurisdiction. Subsequently, after holding dialogue by officials of both states, the proposed construction temple at the area by SONGRONGMA and the prohibitory order imposed by DC, Mamit were revoked.

Around 50 (fifty) Tripura State Rifles (TSR) personnel were deployed at Thaidawr Tlang and they were stationed at old BSNL Office and PRJB School at Phuldungsei (both buildings are within Mizoram side). Earlier, they had been performing duty at the approach road of Thaidawr Tlang, however, since the night of 26.10.2020, around 20 (twenty) TSR personnel were deployed at Thaidawr Tlang/Hill peak.

On 27.10.2020 @ 3:00 p.m. Post Commander, New Kawnpui BOP, 5th IR Battalion and party, who intended to conduct spot verification at Thaidawr Tlang as per the instruction of SP, Mamit were stopped by TSR personnel on their way to Thaidawr Tlang, and TSR personnel on duty informed them that visit of Thaidawr Tlang is not allowed without prior permission from the Tripura Government. In this connection, Mizoram Home Secretary sent a letter to its counterpart Tripura Home Secretary on 28.10.2020 wherein it reiterated that Thaidawr Tlang is a part of Mizoram, and requested that a contingent of about 100 Tripura State Rifles (TSR) personnel stationed at Thaidawr Tlang be shifted inside Tripura and any construction work at the area should be removed.

Tension mounted again in February, 2021 when Tripura Forest Department has taken initiative on 11.2.2021 for construction of Forest Check Post at Khantlang Junction (Mizoram side), Mizoram-Tripura border which is around 1 km east of New Kawnpui BOP. In this connection, VC Khantlang and Young Chakma Association (YCA) submitted a written petition to Mizoram Home Minister and Forest Minister on 13.2.2021 which stated their opposition to the proposed construction of Tripura Forest Check Post at Khantlang Junction as the area fell under Khantlang VC jurisdiction and requested to take necessary action.
In connection with the above, SDO (Civil), West Phaileng and SDPO, West Phaileng visited the area on 15.2.2021 and held a short interaction with Tripura Forest RO and staff, who were available at the area. Officials of Mizoram informed Tripura Forest RO not to continue construction of Forest Check Post at Khantlang Junction, Mizoram-Tripura border as the area falls under Mizoram jurisdiction.

Further, SDPO, Kanchanpur, North Tripura, Range Officer and officials of Tripura Forest Department, personnel of BSF and Tripura State Rifles came to Khantlang Junction (Mizoram side), Mizoram-Tripura border, on 23.2.2021 @ 12:00 noon with an intention to construct Tripura Forest Check-Post at the said area.

Upon learning the stated development, SI Liantluanga, the then Post Commander, 5th IR Battalion New Kawnpui BOP rushed to the area and informed officials of Tripura government not to take any initiative for construction of Forest Check Post at the area without prior approval of DC, Mamit. However, Tripura Forest Officials erected signboard bearing 'Forest Check Post Kawnpui, Kanchanpur Forest Sub-Division, Kanchanpur, North Tripura' at the area, and the signboard was subsequently removed by the Post Commander, New Kawnpui BOP in presence of the above stated Tripura officials. Later, officials of Tripura government left the area without any untoward incident. After the above stated incidents, there has been no report of tension along Mizoram-Tripura border.
