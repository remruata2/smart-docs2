****Assam Police Dismantled Farm Huts****:**According to report, 50 cubic of sawn timber owned by RK Laldawgliana of Buhchang within his land at Ramthar Zau/Bitlachhora was forcibly taken away by 6 armed Assam Police personnel, 2 Assam Forest personnel and 10 Brus last Wednesday. They also took 1 goat and 2 hens from Sofiq Uddin hired for caretaker by RK Laldawngliana at the farmland. They also threatened to burn Sofiq Uddin's house if he does not leave within 3 days.**

 Around 30 Assam Police went to Buhchang farmland yesterday and dismantled two houses of the caretakers of RK Laldawngliana's farmland along with two houses of the caretakers of R.Kapzuala's farmland which is next to RK Laldawngliana's farmland.

 RK Laldawngliana had already lodged an FIR to Bilkhawthlir Police out post on Wednesday, and Mizoram Police had visited the place of occurrence. The problem was again reported to Bilkhawthlir Police out post yesterday but the OC is reported to tell them that no action can be taken if not ordered by the authority.

 Three months before this incident, Assam forest personnel were reported to have examined RK Laldawngliana's farmland along with its neigbouring area.
