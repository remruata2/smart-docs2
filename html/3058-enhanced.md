****SPECIAL REPORT****

No. MSB/CB/SR/2020/263

Dated: 9th May, 2020.

As per input, members of South Chawilung Branch YMA who perform border guard duty at Chandarabighat, a sub-village under Khojoisury VC, Lunglei District since 5.5.2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were prohibited to perform patrolling duty along the Indo-Bangladesh Fencing line by 60 Bn. BSF deployed in the area. Around 6 members of South Chawilung Branch YMA set up Duty Camp near Gate No.16 of Indo-Bangladesh Fencing and have performed round the clock duty since then. They were reportedly asked to dismantle their Duty Camp and to withdraw from the border fencing line by BSF last evening i.e., 8.5.2020 and as a result, YMA members withdrew from their Camp at around 9:30 p.m. and returned to South Chawilung after they have dismantled their Camp.

As per input, BSF permitted YMA members to perform patrolling duty only 150 mtrs. away from Indo-Bangladesh Fencing. However, South Chawilung Branch YMA felt that since there are 2 (two) culverts along the fencing line in the area which can be easily used for border crossing, patrolling outside 150 mtrs. will not be effective in preventing unauthorized border crossing.

South Chawilung Branch YMA is deeply upset over the incident and has given information regarding the incident to Group and Sub-Headquarters YMA leaders.

As per input, Tlabung Branch, YMA is also now prohibited by BSF to occupy their Duty Post which was set up under a steel bridge along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border at Tablabagh.

In this connection, 10 (ten) Leaders of Khawthlang Tuipui Group YMA left Tlabung by boat today, i.e., 9.5.2020 @ 10:00 a.m to visit YMA Duty Post set up at Tablabagh area. They were, however, stopped and prevented from proceeding further by 131 Bn. BSF at Nunsury. Consequently, Khawthlang Tuipui Group YMA convened a meeting at YMA Run, Tlabung under the chairmanship of Pu Zokunga Sailo and 23 (twenty three) members attended. The meeting observed with serious disappointment the actions of the 60 Bn. BSF and 131 Bn. BSF and their alleged lack of cooperation in guarding the border and even discussed total withdrawal of YMA from border guarding. The meeting also considered deployment of YMA__members away from the Fencing line to be less effective as there are a number of

culverts and gullies that can easily be used for border crossing. The meeting after prolonged deliberation, however, agreed to continue COVID-19 duty as permitted by BSF, i.e., 150 mtrs. away from Fencing, in view of the gravity of threat posed by COVID-19 and on the strength of the request made by Sub-Headquarters, YMA, Lunglei. It also requested South Chawilung Branch YMA to resume COVID-19 border duty at the earliest.

Similarly, Sub-Headquarters YMA, Lunglei convened an Emergency Meeting of its Office Bearers’ later today @ 1:00 p.m at their office. The meeting pointed out that border guarding duty along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border is undertaken by YMA Khawthlang Tuipui Group at the request of Young Chakma Association (YCA). It expressed serious concern over the above actions of BSF and considered BSF objection on deployment of YMA duties, particularly in Fencing Gate No. 14, 15 and 16 areas, will leave them highly vulnerable to unwanted cross-border movement. The meeting passed the following resolutions which were subsequently highlighted in a PR issued later today :-

1. YMA will continue to perform COVID-19 border duty for the safety of our State and YMA Sub-Headquarters Lunglei is ready to face any opposition in this regard.
2. Government should take necessary action to solve the problems faced by YMA in guarding the border.
3. All culverts that could be used for border crossing should be immediately sealed.

Situation is under close watch.
