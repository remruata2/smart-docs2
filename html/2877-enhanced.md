Regarding FIR lodged at Aizawl Police Station on 20.7.2012 by Assam Rifles against people who have LSC in the area occupied by Assam Rifles, the Police examined LSC of the upper part of Bethlehem Veng in Assam Rifles area yesterday: the Police have seized LSC of 8 people so far.

The Police notified 45 LSC holders mentioned in the FIR to come at their own land while verification was done but only 17 people appeared and the whereabouts of other 28 people are not known.

LSC owners admit that it is wrong to have LSC on Assam Rifles land, but at the same time, they said as LSC were given out by Revenue Department and it was the fault of Revenue Department, though they implored the Police not to seize their LSCs, the Police have to act as per procedure.
