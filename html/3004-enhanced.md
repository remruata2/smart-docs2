****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/818

Dated: 5th November, 2019.

 The on-going roadblock organised by Bru NGOs in between Kanchanpur and Ananda Bazar, Tripura continued today, i.e. 5.11.2019 and around 1,000 (one thousand) persons participated in the roadblock.

 Information has been received that 2 (two) persons, viz. Langaih Reang, s/o Lalsinga of Hamsapara Camp and Dohoram of Kaskau Camp suffered physical injuries at the hands of Tripura Police. The said two persons, while proceeding towards Kanchanpur in a two-wheeler to participate in the roadblock, were stopped at Police Check Gate at Joyshree Village (before reaching Kanchanpur) by Tripura Police allegedly for checking of the two-wheeler document as a result of which an altercation occurred. It is reported that they suffered physical injuries while they went to take out the two-wheeler. The participants of the roadblock were unhappy over the incident but no specific action plan was drawn up in connection with the incident.

 Information has also been received that the general public who participated in the roadblock are demoralised and frustrated of their action and are losing hope of it achieving positive outcome. Many are expressing their desire to call-off the roadblock w.e.f. 6.11.2019, but the leaders of Bru NGOs are yet to decide their future course of action.

 There is no reported incident of death or persons being hospitalized due to alleged starvation as on today.

 Situation is under close watch.
