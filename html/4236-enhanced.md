_YOUNG MIZO ASSOCIATION (YMA)_

**Young Mizo Association (YMA) :** Young Mizo Association (YMA) as it is popularly known today was formerly called Young Lushai Association (YLA) when it was formed in June 15, 1935 by the Christian missionaries and the pioneer Mizo Christians.
 Indian Independence in 1947 brought about political revival even in Mizoram resulting in the change of “Young Lushai Association’ to “ Young Mizo Association” on 7th October,1947, as the latter has a more panoramic coverage.

Eligibility:  Everyone can become a member once he/she has attained 14 years and there is no upper age limit. A person can remain a member of the Y.M.A as long as he wishes, regardless of his age, contrary to what the word ‘young’ seems to suggest (In fact, the word ‘young’ is descriptive of the Mizos as a community). There are two ways of becoming its member- Firstly, one becomes its annual member by contributing Rs.5/-. Secondly, one can become its member by contributing Rs.100/-. Further, if an individual has been a member of the Y.M.A for more than 5 years, he/she can apply for life membership to the CEC (Central Executive Committee) through the local branch to which he/she belongs. The present enrolment of Y.M.A members has crossed over 4 lakhs and is the biggest organization in the state apart from the Church.
 Y.M.A is an all India Organisation with branches at Mizoram, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura. It is registered under the Societies Registration Act (Act XXI of 1860) Registration No. SR4 of 1977.
Motto of Y.M.A:  1. Good use/ Proper utilization of leisure time.  2. Reverence for a good Christian life.  3. Striving towards a holistic development of the Mizo society. 



Chain of Authority in Y.M.A.

 The highest authority is the General Conference. Next to this is the Central Co-ordination Committee (CCC). Below this governing body is the Central Executive Committee (CEC). Under the CEC, there are sub-headquarters, groups and many sub-divisions called branches which are further divided into sections. At present, YMA has 5 sub-headquarters, 47 group YMA and 772 branches, spread all over Mizoram and in the states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura.
