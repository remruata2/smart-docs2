<p style="margin-right:-2px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">There was bomb blast at a mosque named &lsquo;Bhaithul Mukharram Jamma Masjid&rsquo; located near Zophai in the disputed Inner line Forest Reserve area around 0215 hours in the intervening night of 23<sup>rd</sup> &ndash; 24<sup>th</sup>&nbsp; May, 2019.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the wake of the recent continuation of Masjid construction work carried out by Muslim community at Zophai situation assessment on the issue was conducted by meeting leaders of Kachurthal Masjid Committee at Jamira and discussed with them the current situation at length as well as possible backlash in an event of the problem getting out of hand.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kachurthal Masjid Committee insisted that the Masjid construction has nothing to do whatsoever with the boundary dispute. That, the land they had procured from a Mizo resident of Bairabi was meant previously for cemetery where they later constructed a Masjid, and would not bother whether the site is within the territory of Mizoram or Assam. They argued that the construction of a Masjid at Zophai is no different from the one in Aizawl, or those buildings Mizo Christians have at different Mission Fields in Assam.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also insisted that they sincerely wanted to maintain peace in the area and that they had been doing so in cordial relation with NGOs of Bairabi to date. The President of Kachurthal Masjid Committee, Mr. Zafar Iqbal, referring to the recent incident of bomb blast at Bhaitul Mukharam Masjid on the night of 23.5.2019, claimed that more than a thousand Muslims across the country had come forward for support and solidarity which they regretted by saying that the incident was mere handiwork of some miscreants which should not be taken on communal lines, and they had done so in an effort to pacify tension in the area. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">While the implicit comments by the Kachurthal Masjid Committee leader about their response to the Muslim Community&rsquo;s support across the country,in the wake of recent bomb blast, in a way, reflects their sincerity to maintain peace in the area, as well as their desire not to get Muslim community entangled in the boundary issue, it can also be construed as a warning of possible repercussions in an event of the Masjid being targetted.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kachurthal Masjid Committee also learnt that a meeting between Officials of Assam and Mizoram with the initiative of the Central Government is imminent, and are hopeful that the meeting would bear fruitful solution to the current impasse.</span></span></span></span></p>

They felt that it is imperative, at this juncture, to maintain peace at all cost. In short, they are open while expressing their view, stating that they have had enough of communal tension, enough of being the focal point in politics, saying that they are directly the worst affected, and would welcome maintenance of peace rather than conflict with their neighbours on Assam side. </span></span></span></span></p>
