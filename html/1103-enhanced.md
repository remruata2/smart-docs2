To,

 The Asstt. Inspector General of Police - III

 Mizoram, Aizawl

Ref: NO.PHQ/OPS-190/MP Elect/ 2014/289  dt. 8.4.2014.

Subject: Report on Bomb Blast in Bungkawn, Aizawl District in Mizoram-regd.

Sir,

 With reference to your letter number and subject cited above, I am to state that an explosion took place in the morning of 22.3.2014 at around 3:50am near the residence of Pu Hmingchungnunga, Chairman, Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) at Bungkawn Vengthar, Aizawl highly suspected to be deliberately planted causing some damages. However, no human casualty had been caused by the blast.

 In this regard, Aizawl PS Case No. 84/2014 dt. 22.3.2014 u/s 447/427 IPC r/w Sec. 3(a) E.S. Act had been registered. However, no arrest has yet been made till date. During the course of investigation, it is affirmed that there has been no election/political overtones to the incident, rather it is strongly presumed the issue relates to long rivalry between the incumbent Chairman of Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) Hmingchungnunga and the Manipur-based armed group of HPC(D).

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**

Superintendent of Police
