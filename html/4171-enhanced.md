| d. | Gist of the cases | Yesterday, an enquiry report submitted by SI R. Lalhmangaihzuala to the effect on dt. 11.12.2024 at around 4:50 p.m., one person appeared at Saiphai Outpost stating that there would be a transaction (handing over) of Heroin (No. 4) at the interstate border (Mizoram and Assam) near Notosora Bridge Saiphai. He further stated that his friends posing as willing buyer were in contact with one person to sell Heroin (No. 4). He requested us to intervene and seized the Heroin during the transaction. He further stated that the transaction is in progress at the interstate border and requested immediate intervention of Police as his friends did not bring money for the transaction exposing their intention of fooling the owner. Accordingly, due to the constricted timeframe, SI. R. Lalhmangaihzuala and party (one Head Constable and one Constable) proceeded towards Mizoram and Assam border near Notosora Bridge availing the informant’s vehicle so as not to raise suspicion. It was already dark on reaching the place where the informant informed where the transaction is going to happen, which was in the middle of Teak plantation. The Informant then drove away in his car after dropping the Police party at the location. There were two vehicles at the location, one vehicle besides the road and the other vehicle about 50 meters within the teak plantation. Further, there were around eight persons present who were Non-Mizos believed to be the owner of the suspected No.4 Heroin and friends of the informant. On approaching the location and informing that Police have arrived, one person suddenly fled into the teak plantation. HC Lalngaizuala pursued him, but since it was very dark, he could not apprehend the person who ran inside the teak plantation. Scuffle ensued and apprehended one Non-Mizo. But, after ascertaining that he was one of the accomplice of the informant, he was later uncuffed. After which Police party seized 70 soap cases of Heroin from Maruti Fronx, which was the vehicle of the informant’s friends. As the informant’s friends informed the Police that it was not safe for them to stay in the location for long, they hastily took off from the location with their vehicle as the public from Karkot village were assembling due to the scuffle at the location. Due to the circumstances cited above, mandatory provisions under ND&amp;PS Act could not be initiated in the seizure of the suspected No. 4 Heroin and communication issues between Police and the locals from Karkot village. In order to avoid unnecessary law and order issues with the locals from Karkot village, SI. R. Lalhmangaihzuala and party (one Head Constable and one Constable) along with the suspected Heroin No-4 proceeded back to Saiphai Outpost. On reaching the Outpost, SI. R. Lalhmangaihzuala and party (one Head Constable and one Constable) counted the soap case of suspected Heroin No. 4- totaling 70 soap cases and seized accordingly on the same night. i.e. 11-12-2024 @ 7:45 pm. in presence of one civil witness Constable. Weighing and packing was also done and the seized suspected Heroin weighs 2774 grams amounting to Rs. 83,00,000/- approximately. The seized suspected Heroin No-4 was deposited at the Saiphai Outpost Malkhana for the time being vide MR No. 4/24 Dt. 11.2024 and GD Entry was made vide GDE No. 8/24 Dt. 11.12.2024. During the course of Enquiry, ascertaining the process of the transaction and ascertaining the owners of the vehicle (Maruti Fronx) from where the seizure was made and ascertaining the identity of the friends of the Informant was trying to be made by contacting the informant, but till date, the Informant could not be contacted nor details of the transaction or the accused could not be ascertained from the version of the Informant. Several attempts have been made to contact the Informant, but in vain till date. During further enquiry of the case, I came to learnt that the Heroin had been sent by suspected Kuki militants working with Manipur Frontline Workers in order to raise funds for their outfit. The courier of the seized suspected Heroin who was trying to sell to the Informant and his friends is absconding and hiding in fear of retaliation from the Frontline Workers/Kuki militants. In the light of the enquiry conducted from Dt. 12.12.2024 to 23.12.2024 regarding the ownership of the buyers and sellers of the suspected Heroin No. 4, an enquiry report was submitted for immediate necessary action. The seized suspected Heroin was produced to OC Vairengte Police Station. Hence, VRTE PS C/No. 58/2024 dt. 24/12/2024 U/S 21(c) ND&amp;PS Act was registered and SI PC Hmingthansanga is endorsed to investigate the case. |
