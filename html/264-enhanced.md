Subject: Assessment of threat perception.

 This is to inform you that a letter(enclosed) has been received from DIG(NR) to conduct assessment on threat perception in respect of Chief Engineer, Project Pushpak(BRTF) letter dated 26.12.2015 stating that the road stretching from Km 32 to 42 and Km 82 to 164 on Sairang-Tuipuibari road is under the responsibility of 115 RCC Project Pushpak. Maintenance of the road could not be taken up due to the security problem, the letter stated.

 In this connection, you are instructed to examine the ground situation as to whether giving security to the 115 RCC is necessary or not and also indicate the nature and scale of security to be given if necessary. Your report in English may be submitted at the earliest.

Enclo: As above.
