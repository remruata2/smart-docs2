****Enquiry Report in connection with Lunglei P/S C/No. 90/24 dt.10.05.2024 u/s 20(b) (ii) (B)/ 29 ND &PS Act :****

On 10th May 2024, Lunglei DSB staff seized 13.01kgs. of Ganja at around 05:30 a.m. near Eldorado building, Lunglei Bazar Veng which was transported using a Duster Car. The following four persons who were travelling by the said car from Aizawl to Lunglei on the night of 09.05.2024 and who are all drivers by profession were apprehended at the place of occurrence:

 (a) Joseph Hmangaihsanga (31) s/o Simon Zoduhsanga, Chawnpui, Aizawl

 (b) Khupminlian (20) s/o Ginzalal, Madanriting, Shillong, Meghalaya.

 (c) Lallawmawma (38) s/o Vanlalrema, Vaivakawn, Aizawl.

 (d) Lalbiakliana (28) s/o Thanglalrema, Bawngkawn Brigade, Aizawl

The accused persons were handed over to Lunglei PS by Lunglei DSB staff and hence Lunglei PS Case N.o 90/24 dated 10.05.2024 u/s 20 (b) (ii) (B)/ 29 NDPS Act was registered and were formally arrested. At the time of the seizure, approximately one kilogram of Ganja were wrapped separately using brown cello-tape which was further kept inside an old duffle bag. Interrogation of the accused persons revealed that the smuggled articles are transported from Shillong but the means of transportation were not revealed by any of the accused persons. At the time of the interrogation, Khupminlian of Meghalaya stated that he came to Aizawl on around 20.04.2024 and placed an order for the Ganja on 06.05.2024 from a non-Mizo transporter through telephone. The consignment then reached Aizawl on the evening of 08.05.2024 which the accused person pickup from a local but unidentified person at Aizawl, Dawrpui Veng who transported the Ganja in a gearless scooter. However, the accused person, namely Khupminlian could not provide any information about the telephone numbers of the alleged smuggler (s) or transporter and their identities.

The Call Detail Records of the telephone number of Khupminlian of Meghalaya (8798210754), the prime suspect of the case was obtained by CID (SB) on 07.06.2024. Though there is some technical issue with the provided information on the CDR, analysis of the tower locations of the said phone number revealed that contrary to his statement, Khupminlian was in Shillong, Meghalaya on 06.05.2024 and left Shillong on the evening of 07.05.2024. As per the location of his mobile phone, Khupminlian then reached Aizawl on the forenoon of 08.05.2024 via Kawnpui and Lungdai villages. 

From the light of the above movement of the accused Khupminlian of Meghalaya who is a driver by profession and often work as a substitute driver at his father’s maxi cab counter at Shillong, it is strongly believed that Khupminlian (20) s/o Ginzalal, Madanriting, Shillong, Meghalaya had procured the seized Ganja from Shillong, Meghalaya and transported the contraband by himself using a public transport since he did not possess any vehicle or conveyance. The accused possibly drove or boarded a maxi cab which can be substantiated from the fact that his movement from Kawnpui to Aizawl was via Lungdai road.
