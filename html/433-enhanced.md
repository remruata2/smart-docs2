 The combined team left Aizawl on the afternoon of 9th June, 2012 and halted for the night at Vairengte instead of proceeding straight to Silchar Airport that evening in order to avoid unnecessary exposure. The team left Vairengte on the early morning of 10th June, 2012 and arrived Silchar Airport around 9:00 AM. The team Commander Pu C. Lalruaia, Addl. SP, Aizawl quickly contacted the CISF Officers(Airport Security) on their arrival at the Airport and briefed them about their operation plans, and also requested their co-operation.The two HPC(D) leaders were arrested immediately after the flight landed at the Silchar Airport and were taken towards Mizoram after having jurisdiction. The arrest, as well as other formalities were done quietly and quickly as planned.
