The caller had demanded Rs. 3 (three) lakhs. The caller had also threatened the Range Officer not to divulge anything about the extortion demand or else he would be eliminated.

 Upon enquiry, the Range Officer (RO) had disclosed that the extortionist had again called him last night, i.e. 14.09.2014 @ 9:30pm suggesting payment of the amount through bank account. The RO however told him that he did not have the amount demanded at the moment and suggested payment may be made in installments. At this juncture, the caller had told the R.O that he would call him back on 19.09.2014 after consultation with his superiors.

 The RO further disclosed that he had, on earlier occasion, paid Rs. 2 (two) lakhs during June, 2014. He stated that the extortionist had instructed him to handover the cash to Pu Bawiha, VCP of Khawlian. However, when the RO went there to hand over the cash, the VCP had gone somewhere and had handed over the cash to Pu Liansanga, church elder (BCM), as instructed by the VCP. The RO stated further that he had also received acknowledgement call from the extortionist over payment of the said Rs. 2 lakhs.

26.9.14 Input received indicated that the HPC(D) had made extortion demands to various Retailers, Village Councils, contractors and some Government servants in Sakawrdai, Khawlian, Darlawn and Suangpuilawn area. Input suggests that a contractor (Mobile no. 8729918649 whose identity is yet to be ascertained), who is known to be doing construction of Police Quarters at New Vervek O.P, has agreed to pay a certain amount of money to the HPC(D) 2ndin-charge of Hmar Bial area, who is also identified as S/S Sgt.

 The HPC(D) normally make extortion demands through mobile phones asking the V/Cs to hand over the money to them on Manipur side.

 Given the scenario of the extortion spree by HPC(D) inside Mizoram from across their hideout in Manipur, it is imperative to adopt measures to check and prevent these extortion activities.

23.10.14 Hmar Peoples’ Convention-Democrat (HPC-D) issued a press release on 23.10.2014 condemning the frequent demands of ransom from Village Councils and Departments under the Government in Northern parts of Mizoram. The HPC(D) claimed that their organization never indulged in such unhealthy activities.

24.11.14 The HPC(D) (Sangbera’s faction) has issued a diktat expressing its desire that no Political party within their demand area should file nomination for the upcoming Village Council (VC) Election 2015. The HPC(D) has directed Village Councils within their demand area to form a common candidate in their respective villages instead. An unsigned letter typed in a Letter-head of HPC(D) Army wing bearing the name as ‘Bieka Hmar’ Area Commander, and the date as 16.11.2014 was received by VCs of Saipum and Saiphai Villages on 22.11.2014 in which the HPC(D) had also expressed strong resentment on the Government of Mizoram and NGOs for their alleged discrimination against the Hmar Community.

 Another group of HPC(D) (Sangbera’s faction) cadres numbering 12 (twelve) armed with sophisticated weapons had infiltrated into Tinghmun village on the night of 22.11.2014. The group first approached the VCP who arranged a vehicle (Sumo Maxi cab) MZ 01D 9774 driven by Materema as requested by the HPC(D) and entered a Labour camp located about 5(five) kilometres towards Sakawrdai side @ 02 : 00 am (23.11.2014). The group then handed over an extortion letter demanding 10% of the estimated amount from the contractor, Pu Malsawmdawngliana s/o V. Neihkunga of Chanmari, Aizawl who is doing road construction works between Sakawrdai and Tinghmun. The letter is hand-written in HPC(D) letter-head purportedly signed by L.Hmar, and the amount to be paid before 10th December 2014. It is reported that 8(eight) Workers including Pu Lalhmingtana of Sakawrtuichhun, Aizawl Manager of the road construction were staying at the camp on that night. The group had taken 220 Gelatin sticks (approx) along with 100 detonators and also snatched all mobile phones of the workers. The mobile phones were however returned through the VCP of Tinghmun @ 09:00 am after the group left the village.

 It is also reported that the group was led by S/S Sgt Maj Lalbieklien and Ex-Const Malsawmkima 1st MAP (deserter).

The letters were purportedly signed by ‘Siama Hmar’, who is believed to be S/S Sgt, Maj. Thangsiem, Area commander. They also demanded Rs 10,000/- to be sent to village Elders of Sihpuikawn, Manipur before 15th December 2014 positively. It is reported that no VC has so far paid the extortion demand.

 It is also reported that in some villages, the outfit(HPC-D) leaders had contacted village leaders through telephone and asked them to hand over the demand money through Pu Lalhmangaihzuala, Vice President, New Vervek Village Council. So far, no report on such transaction has been received and the situation is kept under close watch.

Accordingly, 4 (four) school teachers, 1 (one) retailer, 3 (three) members of Village Council Khawpuar, and a Village Crier (Tlangau) gathered in the house of Pu Zoremthanga. The HPC(D) cadres demanded Rs 50,000/- to Village Council leaders, Rs 20,000/- to retailer and 5% of one month’s salary to school teachers. Accordingly, Village Council leaders gave Rs 7,000/- to HPC(D) cadres and the retailer also gave Rs.10,000/- to HPC(D) cadres. However, the school teachers could not give the demand of HPC(D) cadres as they have not yet received their salaries.

Although, the identities of these HPC(D) cadres could not be ascertained as of now, it is strongly believed that they were the group led by S/S Sgt. Major Thangsiem, Commander and S/S Sgt.Chuailova, 2ndi/c who are active in Parbung/Senvon areas inside Manipur.

 On hearing the infiltration of these HPC(D) cadres, Mizoram Police party numbering @ 25 personnel under the command of SDPO Sakawrdai immediately rushed to Khawpuar in the morning of 10.2.2015 to enquire the incident and a criminal case is being registered at Sakawrdai Police Station.

08.05.2015 On the night of 7.5.2015, the Mizoram Police Operational Party which was patrolling the area of Mizoram bordering Manipur received specific information that the main persons accused in the ambush, who were wanted in FIR No.6/15 dated 29/3/2015 u/s 302/307/396/397/120(B)/326 IPC r/w 25(1A)/27(B) Arms Act of Sakawrdai PS, were hiding in Tiaulian village of Manipur, just across the border. The information was very specific and the accused would have slipped away, therefore, Operation Team decided to verify the information and approached Tiaulian village, early on the morning of 8.5.2015 at the break of dawn. On seeing the approaching Police party, some persons started running and were asked to stop. Instead of stopping, these persons started unprovoked firing on the Police party who had no option but to return fire in self-defense. One of the attackers was hit by the defensive fire while others managed to escape. The attacker, who was hit, succumbed to his injuries and was identified as deserter Constable **H.C. Malsawmkima** of Mizoram Police who had deserted along with two service weapons and ammunitions of Mizoram Police on 11.7.2014 and joined HPC-D. The deceased has also been identified as one of the main accused in the ambush of 28.3.2015.

The said ammunitions are supposed to be carried by Inspr.Tlangthangzuala @ Zuala, O/C Parbung Police Station, Manipur Police and his party who will be conducting spot verification and enquiry on the recent incident at Tiaulian, Manipur. Police party who are supposed to carry the ammunitions will be travelling in Police Gypsy and another vehicle probably Mahindra Bolero hired by HPC(D) will be carrying pro-HPC(D) Cameramen and journalists.

 As of now, the exact time of their departure could not be ascertained, but as per their tour programme, they will first reach Patpuihmun via Parbung road and then Ankhachhuah from which they will hire a Launch (propelled Boat) for Tiaulian.

 Information also added that the initiative taken up by DGP Manipur to transfer out Inspr. Tlangthangzuala @Zuala from Parbung Police Station was turned down by the Hon’ble Home Minister of Manipur on the personal request of Chaltonlien, Congress MLA, Tipaimukh Constituency.
