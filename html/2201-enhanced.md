****GENESIS OF THE FORMATION OF****

****MIZORAM PEOPLE FORUM(MPF)****

 Following the expectations set by the Indian Electoral Laws and System for the efficient running of a democratic government, the different churches of Mizoram have been taking active part in the process by issuing election messages before the election and offering prayers for peaceful conduct of the poll; the YMA and other voluntary groups have also taken certain measures in this regard. Although it can be said that these messages, to a certain extent, improved the efficiency of the elections it was, however, not deemed fully satisfactory. During these elections the amount of money that was utilized for the election purposes increased significantly. The amount of money spent in the 1978 MLA Election and the amount spent in the 2003 MLA Election has increased by manifolds, as per the research. This is expected to drastically increase the practice of corruption in Mizoram.

 The Mizoram Presbyterian Church Synod Meeting (vide Synod 2004 Gen. 11&amp;Gen.58) resolved to rectify and reform the state of politics in Mizoram. Following this resolutions(SEC 201:13, 206:45), the Synod Executive Committee held talks with leaders of different churches of Mizoram, different prominent NGO’s, intellectuals and respected individuals of Mizoram. Ensuing with the different views and advice of these groups and individuals a concrete action plan was made.

 Adhering to this plan of action, the different churches and prominent NGOs of the state held a deliberation on July 5th, 2005 where they decided on the need to improve the state of politics in Mizoram and adopted a proposal for the same. However, it was resolved that each church and each group have a discussion on the proposal within their own church or group. On September 1st, 2005, the representatives from the different churches and prominent NGOs came together and formally accepted the formation of the Mizoram People Forum(MPF) so that a greater initiative can be taken towards the improvement of politics within the state, wherein a Working Committee was set up to chalk out the modalities and working plan, as well as the objectives. After careful consideration deliberation and assessment of these objectives, it was deemed satisfactory and so the Mizoram People Forum was formally formed on June 21st, 2006.
