In fact in the strife-torn North East India, Mizoram can boast of being the least militant infected State mainly because the budding militancy have been nabbed by Mizoram Police in its infant stage. The last of such militant was the coming overground 64 strong SPLA cadres just after completion of their training somewhere in the border between Myanmar and Manipur under the eagis of PREPAK in 2009.</span></span></span></span></p>

A truce, termed suspension of operation had also been drafted and the Govt. look forward to having the next round of meeting shortly. Collection of taxes in their so called demand area has also subsided during the recent past.</span></span></span></span></p>

Movement of this militant have been closely watched and have never posed major threat to the internal security in Mizoram except minor kidnapping cases in the border areas of Mizoram-Tripura-Bangladesh.</span></span></span></span></p>

Considering seizure of huge cache of arms prior to 2009 some arms and contraband goods after this notion could not be ruled out. However, it could also boldly be said that arms trafficking has been successfully checked during the last two years.</span></span></span></span></p>

The 700km. plus international border is somewhat porous and are sometimes taken advantage of by various insurgent groups for arms smuggling and also for transit of the militant group themselves. Border security forces as well as Assam Rifles personnel could not fully cover the whole border areas and hence intelligence network and State Police force needs to be strengthened so as to assist para military forces posted in the border areas to check free movement of undesirable elements and also to prevent illegal immigrants from entering Indian soil.</span></span></span></span></p>

Seizure of arms, drugs, arrest of perpetrators etc confirmed that Mizoram is the main transit route of all NE insurgent groups including anti-social elements for procurement of arms both from Bangladesh and Myanmar. In the last 4/5 years, the State Police seized 153 and 124 sophisticated and non-sophisticated arms respectively, total - 277 and total 13637 ammns. during 2008 to Aug, 2012 alone and in fact, seizure of arms, ammns, drugs and the arrest made in this period could have been just a tip of an iceberg.</span></span></span></span></p>
