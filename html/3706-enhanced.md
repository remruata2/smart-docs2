**Points: 9.2(iii) Myanmar Refugee Issue:**

 Mizoram shares 496.531 kms of international border with Myanmar as per the record of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram which is unfenced. Moreover, the Free Movement Regime allows people of the adjoining countries to enter 16 kms into the neighboring state. The Indo-Myanmar border security is currently handled by Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

 Military rule which took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 deposed thedemocratically electedNational League for Democracy and the escalating resistance put up against the military regime by Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) had a huge impact and resulted in the influxes of considerable number of refugees from Myanmar in general and Chin community in particular seeking asylum and taking shelter in Mizoram. Input received indicated that CRPH and CDM supporters are adamant and determined to continue their armed resistance which could potentially increase the arrival of more Myanmar refugees. These refugees presently took shelter in various districts of Mizoram and are accommodated in their relative’s houses and makeshift camps set up by NGOs. According to the latest information received, makeshift camps for Myanmar refugees are constructed at Zawlsei, Vaphai, Farkawn and Chawngtui Villages in Champhai District and at Thingsai, Bualpui 'H', New Ngharchhip and Cherhlun Villages by in Hnahthial District by their respective local NGOs.

 The district wise details of Myanmar refugees, as per this office records, are highlighted in the following table (as on 25.04.2023):

|  **Sl.No** | **District** | **Total numbers of Refugees** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Aizawl | 3306 |
| 2. | Lunglei | 1807 |
| 3. | Champhai | 10226 |
| 4. | Lawngtlai | 5900 |
| 5. | Siaha | 7872 |
| 6. | Hnahthial | 1142 |
| 7. | Serchhip | 509 |
| 8. | Kolasib | 215 |
| 9. | Saitual | 125 |
| 10. | Khawzawl | 190 |
| 11. | Mamit | 356 |
| **TOTAL -** |  | **31,648** |


 These figures are compiled from the daily information received from the various sectors officers of CID (SB) posted in different parts of the states. It may also be mentioned that the above figures are prone to fluctuations as the refugees themselves did not settled down permanently and often moved across the border due to certain reasons such as financial reasons, family affairs etc.

 Influx of Myanmar refugees in large numbers can have an adverse impact socio-economically not only to their relatives who shelter them but also the state government in general. The increase in the number of thefts and robberies may also be attributed to the large number of unemployed refugees. The possibility of Law and Order due to internal feuds between the permanent resident of Mizoram and the refugees could not be ruled out on issues like issuance of birth certificate or other documents to these refugees.

 Another possible consequence of the escalating situation of Myanmar and the influx of refugees is the increase in the amount of narcotics and illegal arms smuggled across the border. The reasons for these increase may be attributed to the decline in the number of military check gates on the Myanmar side and the refugees themselves acting as a peddlers/dealers of these contrabands to support themselves and their families financially as most of these refugees are unemployed in Mizoram and had quit their job in Myanmar.

**Points 19.7(II) Strengthening of Security and Intelligent Network along Mizoram - Myanmar border:**

 According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, about 40 villages scattered along the unfenced Mizoram-Myanmar border. Apart from the Border Guarding Force (Assam Rifles) and BOPs in different border areas set up by Mizoram Police, Integrated Check Post to monitor the movement of people across the border will function soon at Zokhawthar.

 Sector Officers of CID (SB) are posted in each districts of Mizoram bordering Mizoram namely Siaha District, Hnahthial District and Champhai District to build a robust intelligent network system for internal security as well as to curb the menace of smuggling of contraband items. To strengthen the intelligent network along the Mizoram - Myanmar border, apart from the existing Sector offices, Special Branch has created new Sector office recently at Zokhawthar on 23.03.2023 which hopefully will greatly increase the intelligence collection particularly in the bordering areas of Champhai district.

Owing to the strong network intelligence collection in place and to counter the menace of smuggling of contraband items, immense efforts constantly and below is given a table showing the amount of seizure such contrabands by CID Special Branch:

**Points: 19.7(iii) - Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agencies and Intelligence Agencies about Rohingyas Crisis and its security implication:**

 The persecution of Myanmar's Rohingyas Muslim dates back to at least the 1970s. Since then, the Rohingyas people have been persecuted on a regular basis by Myanmar government and the so called Buddhist nationalists. The Rohingyas crisis had deepened due to the violent acts of a Muslim insurgent group on 25th August, 2017 acting under the banner of Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). The subsequent offensive operation launched by Myanmar Army against these Muslim insurgents resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and exodus of waves of Rohingyas from Rakhine State, Myanmar into the neighbouring Bangladesh.

Rohingya refugees if present in Mizoram and new entry if any is closely monitored by all Sector Officers and field staffs of Special Branch stationed in different parts of Mizoram. Since, the presence of Rohingyas in Mizoram is not reported at this office, the implication on internal security negligible as of now. However, information regarding refugees seeking asylum in Mizoram are regularly shared with other sister agencies operating in the state through SMAC and LIA meetings.
