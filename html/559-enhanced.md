****ISSUES OF BRU REFUGEES****

**HISTORY**

**On 21.10.1997, Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed** by some Bru miscreants which ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an **Autonomous District Council** by the Brus. Tension between the two communities escalated and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram towards Tripura.

The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given **refugees status in Tripura**. They were given **shelter in six refugee camps** and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government.

Amidst this type of situation, Mizoram and Central Government devised plans to repatriate these refugees to Mizoram several times without much success.

**REPATRIATION PROCESS**

Regarding the issue of Bru refugees, the Ministry of Home Affairs has set the deadline for Repatriation of Bru refugees on 30th September, 2019.

 There were 1,681 families (8,869 members) repatriated during 1st to 8th Batch (ie, 2010 to 2018). 4,323 families were already identified in 2019 and 26,365 family members are expected to be repatriated during 2019.

**REASONS FOR HAMPERING THE SUCCESS OF REPATRIATION**

 Firstly, some of the educated leaders of the Bru refugees greatly benefited from their fellow refugees mainly from assistance received from Central Government. They believed themselves to be loosing their easy source of funds if the refugees were repatriated and inturn instigated and sometimes threatened others not to get involved in the repatriation process.

 It is no wonder that, various demands which may be considered not implementable by the State and Central Government are often made deliberately by the Bru refugees whenever repatriation process is about to begin.

 Meanwhile, the Mizo community can accept only those who fled Mizoram in the wake of 1997 incident and their direct descendants for repatriation to Mizoram.

**Law & Order Problem related to Bru Issue**

The main issue which often sprang up regarding Bru refugees is the intentions of Election Commission of India to let these refugees to cast their votes (State Assembly and Parliamentary) during the elections at their respective refugee camps, which has been strongly opposed by the Mizos. In previous years, this objection had let to the near boycotting of the complete election process itself.
