 The three leaders of HPC(D) being detained in Central Jail by Mizoram Police were brought to District Court yesterday and responding to Vanglaini's question, Sangbera said that as they were prisoners they had nothing to say concerning HPC(D) not allowing to file any nomination in the VC election. He said they were in no position to say whether the act of their fellow HPC(D) members were good or bad.

 Lalropuia blamed Mizoram Govt. for their arrest. He said that Mizoram Govt. deceived them by telling them that an arrangement was made to have proper discussion. Instead, the Mizoram Govt. detained them and that now they were very displeased with Mizoram Govt. He also said that member of certain opposition parties and ruling party came over to Central Jail to see them but he was not sure if they were sent by Mizoram Govt. to pay them visit.
