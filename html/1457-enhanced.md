****SUGGESTIONS FOR HIGH LEVEL COMMITTEE ON MYANMAR REFUGEES****

1.  The recent conflict between leaders of NGO United and MPs of  Myanmar where Pu Pathanga, MP Mathupi even submitted a letter to the  Hon'ble Home Minister, Mizoram was due to some misunderstanding  between them regarding utilization of funds. To avert the possibilities of these  kind of misappropriations of funds, a suitable advice/suggestion may be given  to the leaders of these refugees.

2. Refugees who are accommodated in both R.Dengthuama Hall, Mualpui,  Aizawl and BSUP, Sihphir, according to reports, expressed that their main  requirement is adequate ration in their daily life.

3. There are 27 Myanmar MLAs/MPs residing in Aizawl. Some of them  even  rented a house on their own while others jointed their relative in the  City. These  MLAs/MPs are facing accute shortage of funds for basic needs  such as House rent  etc. If arrangements could be made for them, it would  relieve their hardship to a great  extend.

4. Apart from the refugees accommodated at R.Dengthuama Hall and  BSUP, Sihphir, there are several refugees scattered throughout Aizawl. If these  refugees could be settled in a designated Camps, it will be easier for the  Government to look after  them.

5. Some of the Myanmar MPs/MLA who had fled to Mizoram often  received intimidations and threats through mobile phones from Zomi  Revolutionary Army Cadres. To comfort and instill confidence in them, it  might be helpful if uniformed Mizoram Police personnel visited them at their  residence at a frequent time interval.
