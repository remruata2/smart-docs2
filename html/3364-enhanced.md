**INTERNAL SECURITY MIZORAM**

1. **Internal security situation in Mizoram**

 Mizoram (“Land of the Mizos”) was known as the Lushai Hills District of Assam before it was renamed the Mizo Hills District in 1954. In 1972 it became a centrally administered union territory under the name of Mizoram, and in 1987 it achieved statehood. It has an area of 8,139 square miles (21,081 square km) and a population of 1,091,014as per 2011 census.

Mizoram State although being one of the most peaceful State in the country is sandwiched between two foreign countries(i.e. Myanmar and Bangladesh) and also militant infested States like Manipur, Assam and Tripura are its immediate neighbours which calls for extra alertness in all its border areas.

Mizoram has 496.531 kms. long international border with Myanmar and 319.791 kms. with Bangladesh. The international border is somewhat porous and is sometimes taken advantage of by various insurgent groups for arms smuggling and also for transit of the militant group themselves. Border Security Force as well as Assam Rifles personnel could not fully cover the whole border areas and hence intelligence network and State Police force needs to be strengthened so as to assist para-military forces posted in the border areas to check free movement of undesirable elements and also to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the Indian soil. While the Border Security Force guards the Bangladesh border, the border with Myanmar is guarded by the Assam Rifles.

 Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where around 102 (one hundred two) Cadres and 12 (twelve) Council Members of HPC(D) came to over ground at the ceremony. However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and planning to reorganise themselves which could, in due course of time, pose security problems especially in the northern most and north eastern parts of Mizoram.

 As for the North-Western region, the Bru insurgency has been contained to a great extend so much so that this insurgent Group has become more or less a group of Bandits without any specific demands or objectives. Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF) which was formed in 1997 signed Peace Accord with Govt. of Mizoram on 26.4.2005 and surrendered to the Government on 25.7.2005 and 195 (one hundred

ninety five) Cadres came over ground along with 9 (nine)weapons. Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram(BLFM) surrendered to the Government on 26.10.2006. About 804 (eight hundred four) Cadres came over ground with 66 weapons and 45 ammunitions.

 In fact in the strife-torn North East India, It is commendable of being the least militant infected State and it is mainly due to the swift action of Mizoram Police in nabbing militancy in its early stage.

 Security of Mizoram is entrusted mainly with Mizoram Police with sister agencies viz. Assam Rifles, Border Security Force and Central Reserve Police Force. Mizoram Police deployed Mizoram Armed Police (MAP)/Indian Reserve Battalion mainly along interstate borders by setting up Border Out Posts (BOPs). 3 (three) Battalions of Assam Rifles(AR) manned the Indo-Myanmar border in the East and South while 3 (three) Battalions of Border Security Force(BSF) manned the Western border with limited man-power which leaves many areas vulnerable to infiltration. The porous international borders served as a possible route for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, trafficking of human etc. across the borders of Mizoram. Influx of illegal foreigners from Bangladesh and Myanmar into Mizoram could also create deeper problems.

 Besides, the above noted armed groups operating from across the inter-state boundary which had been more or less contained, there are other insurgent outfit like the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT), National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak Muivah (NSCN) (IM), Arakan Liberation Party (ALP) having base camp across the international border neighbouring Mizoram. Movement of this militant have been closely watched and have never posed major threat to the internal security in Mizoram except few kidnapping cases in the border areas of Mizoram-Tripura-Bangladesh.

 It is often said that the above noted militants and other militants of the North East are using Mizoram for trafficking of arms consignment. Many instances of seizure of some arms and contraband items within the state during the past years indicate use of the state as a trafficking route of the contraband items. However, it could also boldly be said that arms trafficking has been successfully checked during the last two years.

 The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful. Although, Mizoram is surrounded by countries and states which are having many disturbances with respect to insurgency and terrorism.

1. **External security situation in Mizoram**

 The long porous international border could be a security threat to the state. There have been many instances of Arakan Army (AA) presence/activities along Mizoram-Myanmar border in the past years. TheArakanArmyis aRakhine InsurgentGroup inMyanmar, founded on the 10th April 2009.It is the armed wing of theUnited League of Arakan (ULA). The purpose of the AA is to protect Arakan people and to establish peace, justice, freedom and development. They often exchanged fire along the border and illegally entered into Mizoram territory.

In recent year, it has been reported that **over****2,70,000 (two lakhs seventy thousand) Rohingyas refugees entered Bangladesh through border points of Chittagong Division (Bandarban, Rangamati & Khagrachhari Cox Bazar, etc.) in recent year. As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division, further infiltration of illegal migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.**

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Due to its long porous international border with Myanmar and Bangladesh, unlawful influx of foreigners and large scale smuggling of drugs and various contraband into the state through the porous borders has remained a serious concern for several decades.

****It is necessary to explore the possibilities to tackle and check on growing influx of illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh and Myanmar.

CURRENT ISSUES :

**Mizoram - Assam border dispute -**

Mizoram has a boundary of 123 kms with Assam, 66 Kms with Tripura and 95 Kms. with Manipur. Border Security of Mizoram is entrusted mainly with Mizoram Police with sister agencies namely, Assam Rifles, Border Security Force and Central Reserve Police Force.

 For the people of Mizoram, the only known and accepted boundary between Mizoram and Assam is the Inner Line on the Southern Frontier of the District also known as **The Inner Line of the Lushai Hills, 1875**which was notified****on 20th August, 1875 under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873 as subsequently revised in 1878.

 This is also the boundary recognised by and in actual practice both by the people residing in border areas and even by the Assam Government.

There are three points which have been regarded as the boundary points between Cachar and Mizo Hills in practice. These are Kukichera on the Dhaleswari river, Duarband on the old Silchar- Aizawl road and Baga Bazar (Banga Bazar) on the present Silchar-Aizawl road (NH-54). Government servants on transit were regarded to have passed the boundary between Cachar District and Mizo Hills at these points (Vide Assam Fundamental Rule 106 read with Subsidiary Rule, 137). A Mizo Officer who was a Government servant at that time (now retired) clearly mentioned about this).

Therefore, considering all the historical background as well as facts and circumstances of the recent past that are still related amongst the Mizos, it is not possible for the Mizos to accept the imaginary lines, which was drawn without their knowledge or consultation in 1933.

The three South Assam districts of Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj share border with Mizoram’s Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl districts. Mizoram was part of Assam till 1972, when it became a separate Union Territory. In 1987, it became a full-fledged state. While the two states have sparred over the border in the past, the stand-offs have been relatively non-violent and low-key compared to Assam’s dispute with its other neighbours – Nagaland, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh – on the same matter.

_Major Incidents -_

**26.7.2021:** On 26.7.2021 @ 11:30 a.m. around 200 (two hundred) Assam Police led by an IGP of Assam police arrived at Vairengte Auto Stand, near Vairengte (inside Mizoram territory) and tried to forcefully push back 1st Mizo IR Battalion Personnel, who are on duty at the area. SP, Kolasib and party immediately tried to have a dialogue with Assam Police, but the Assam Police refused and informed him that the area falls within Assam territory and they intend to construct camp at the area.

 Later, Assam Police, who heavily outnumbered Mizoram Police at the area forcefully pushed back Mizoram Police and stationed themselves at Mizo IR Bn. camp. Civilians from Vairengte also arrived at the area, and a confrontation and scuffle took place between Assam Police and residents of Vairengte. Assam Police fired a number of Tear Gas and Smoke Bomb towards civilians of Vairengte and Mizoram Police and due to this, 7 (seven) persons sustained minor injuries

 Tension between the 2 (two) sides continued to escalate as Assam Police continue to forcefully occupy Mizo IR Bn Camp and on the same evening. At around 4:40 p.m. exchange of fire took place at the inter-state border as Assam Police first open fire towards Mizoram Police and civilians. The firing lasted for about 45 minutes and subsequently Assam Police abandoned the Camp and withdrew from the area and Mizoram police are still remaining at the area at that time. As per unconfirmed input, there are reported casualties among Assam Police Personnel (5Assam police personnel and 1 civilian killed with several among Assam police wounded) due to firing and there is one Hav. Lalbuatsaiha of 5th IR who sustained a minor injury of grazed gunshot wound on his arm among Mizoram Police. PC Lalmuansanga of Vairengte sustained bullet injury on his thigh and was evacuated to District Hospital, Kolasib.

_MYANMAR REFUGEES -_

 Mizoram shares 496.531 kms. of porous International border with Myanmar as per the record of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram. The Indo-Myanmar border posts are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

 Military takeover took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 whendemocratically electedmembers ofMyanmar'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy, were deposed by Myanmar's Military.

 The escalating resistance put up against the military regime by Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) definitely had an impact and permeate the Indo Myanmar boundary, which resulted in influx of a considerable number of refugees arriving and taking shelter in Mizoram and Manipur. Input received stated that CRPH and CDM supporters are adamant and determined to continue their resistance which had shown a new level including armed resistance for their personnel defence. CRPH and CDM had been steadfast in collecting arms and ammunitions as much as possible from the neighboring countries particularly from the state of Mizoram and Manipur. Besides, they are intending to impart wide scale training on handling of arms and weaponry to its youth supporters. However, the training is yet to commenced due to non availability of suitable training ground. To reinforce and strengthen their resistance in a more effective manner against the military regime, Civil Security Defence (CSD), Tahan Civil Defence Force (TCDF) and Kalay Civil Army (KCA) are working together and a larger group Upper Chindwin Peoples Defence Force (UCPDF) was also formed for effective counter measures against the Military regime.

 Meanwhile, it is pertinent to mention that despite the arrival and presence of refugees in Mizoram, the state Government in compliance to the direction of Ministry of Home Affairs in respect of Myanmarese refugees, had not endorsed and facilitated the arrival of Myanmar refugees. However, civil society organizations and NGOs cannot let down these Myanmarese refugees particularly from the Chin/Sagaing Region who shared close ethnicity and cultural affinity with the Mizos. Further, the assistance provided by these NGOs’ confined solely upon arrival of these asylum seekers within the territory of India.

 To enhance and further intensify the efforts of CRPH and CDM in their endeavour against the military regime as well as to restore democracy, several ousted NLD MPs’ have entered and stationed within India via Mizoram and Manipur. These ousted legislators have been approaching several civil societies and NGOs’ and sought their assistance in various ways.

 Many Myanmar refugees presently took shelter in various districts of Mizoram following military coup in Myanmar. These refugees are accommodated in their relatives house and makeshift camps set up by NGOs. The district wise details of Myanmar refugees are indicated in the following table (as on 17.1.2022):

**Young Mizo Association (YMA) :** Young Mizo Association (YMA) as it is popularly known today was formerly called Young Lushai Association (YLA) when it was formed in June 15, 1935 by the Christian missionaries and the pioneer Mizo Christians.
 Indian Independence in 1947 brought about political revival even in Mizoram resulting in the change of “Young Lushai Association’ to “ Young Mizo Association” on 7th October,1947, as the latter has a more panoramic coverage.

Eligibility:  Everyone can become a member once he/she has attained 14 years and there is no upper age limit. A person can remain a member of the Y.M.A as long as he wishes, regardless of his age, contrary to what the word ‘young’ seems to suggest (In fact, the word ‘young’ is descriptive of the Mizos as a community). There are two ways of becoming its member- Firstly, one becomes its annual member by contributing Rs.5/-. Secondly, one can become its member by contributing Rs.100/-. Further, if an individual has been a member of the Y.M.A for more than 5 years, he/she can apply for life membership to the CEC (Central Executive Committee) through the local branch to which he/she belongs. The present enrolment of Y.M.A members has crossed over 4 lakhs and is the biggest organization in the state apart from the Church.
 Y.M.A is an all India Organisation with branches at Mizoram, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura. It is registered under the Societies Registration Act (Act XXI of 1860) Registration No. SR4 of 1977.
Motto of Y.M.A: 1. Good use/ Proper utilization of leisure time. 2. Reverence for a good Christian life. 3. Striving towards a holistic development of the Mizo society. 



Chain of Authority in Y.M.A.

 The highest authority is the General Conference. Next to this is the Central Co-ordination Committee (CCC). Below this governing body is the Central Executive Committee (CEC). Under the CEC, there are sub-headquarters, groups and many sub-divisions called branches which are further divided into sections. At present, YMA has 5 sub-headquarters, 47 group YMA and 772 branches, spread all over Mizoram and in the states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura.

**Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) and Mizo Students Union(MSU) :**

 These are the two main students organisations of Mizoram having their General Headquarters in Aizawl. Under them are affiliated a certain numbers of regional/sub clan student organisations.

****Mizo Zirlai Pawl**(_Mizo students' Association_) is aMizomultinational student organization and apex students body inMizoramstate. Established on 27 October 1935 inShillongby Mizo earlier educated students. It was registered as SR No. 35 of 1969–70 underIndian Societies Registration Act.

**Mizoram People Forum (MPF):**

 Following the expectations set by the Indian Electoral Laws and System for the efficient running of a democratic government, the different churches of Mizoram have been taking active part in the process by issuing election messages before the election and offering prayers for peaceful conduct of the poll; the YMA and other voluntary groups have also taken certain measures in this regard. During these elections the amount of money that was utilized for the election purposes increased significantly. This is expected to drastically increase the practice of corruption in Mizoram.

 The Mizoram Presbyterian Church Synod held talks with leaders of different churches of Mizoram, different prominent NGO’s, intellectuals and respected individuals of Mizoram.

 The representatives from the different churches and prominent NGOs, after careful consideration deliberation and assessment formally formed the Mizoram People Forum on June 21st 2006.

 Ever since its establishment, MPF has taken great efforts for holding clean, free and fair election in various elections within Mizoram. For this, an agreement, commonly known as “Articles of Agreement” was signed between MPF and all the political parties of Mizoram. The joint efforts these political parties and the Mizoram People Forum in implementing this agreement have been a great success in the past elections.
