Dated: 8th July, 2019.

 Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) General Headquarters, Aizawl issued a Press Release highlighting its Executive Meeting held today, i.e. 8.7.2019 @ 12:00 noon. The Meeting opposed the contest of the rights of the sons of the soil by those successful non-Mizo candidates in the recently declared NEET, JEE and SMATEE results. The meeting expressed its heartfelt gratitude to the Government for the decision taken by Council of Ministers’ Meeting held today wherein ‘Indigenous People’ under Category-I of ‘The Mizoram (Selection of Candidate for Higher Technical Courses) Rules, 2016’ was reserved solely for ‘Zo-Ethnic’ communities as Zo-Ethnic are the only indigenous people of Mizoram. MZP also requested the Government to conduct selection for Technical Courses as per the said rules and will stand up against any attempt to fight over the rights of the Mizo communities.

 The meeting also questioned the commitment of the ‘Core Committee’ that was constituted to study and take necessary action on the issue of Mizoram-Assam border dispute. The Committee, which was under the chairmanship of Mizoram Chief Secretary, has held several meetings with MZP. As decided by the Core Committee, MZP had submitted important documents on Mizoram-Assam border dispute on 16.4.2019, but no tangible actions were initiated till date.

 On the issue of recent renovation and occupation of one building situated at the disputed Forest Reserve area at the outskirt of Vairengte by Assam Forest, the meeting appealed the Government to take necessary action for vacating the said building on or before 12.7.2019. If the Government fail to achieve this, the meeting demanded the Government to construct ‘Zofate Chawlhbuk’ at Zophai, Bairabi on or before 17.7.2019. Should ‘Zofate Chawlhbuk’ not constructed within the stipulated time, MZP will organise “Ram Chhan Kawngzawh” on 19.7.2019.

 The meeting also expressed its gratitude to the Government for setting up of Inquiry Committee to inquire into the collapse of BSUP buildings at Durtlang on the evening of 2.7.2019 and further demanded those responsible to be awarded suitable punishment.
