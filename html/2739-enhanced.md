****HMAR PEOPLES CONVENTION (HPC) &****

****HMAR PEOPLES CONVENTION (DEMOCRATIC) [HPC(D)]****

**1. Birth of HPC and Demand for Autonomous District Council :**

 The Hmars being a dominant ethnic group of Mizoram have never felt the need nor aspired for any special political status for their community in Mizoram. They were a secured and contented community. However, mainly due to the influence of the Hmars living out side the State, politically ambitious section of the community started propounding the need for preserving their democratic rights, culture and ethnic identity. In 1986 the Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) was formed with the sole objective of the creation of an Autonomous District Council (ADC) for the Hmars within Mizoram. Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent unlawful activities like abducting and killing of the Mizoram Police personnel, extorting money etc. and thus jeopardising the law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area.

**2. Signing of Peace Accord :**

 The Mizoram Police was geared up and the Government of Mizoram eventually managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants resulting in the signing of a Peace Accord on 27th July 1994. The Govt. of Mizoram also agreed to set up the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) for the socio-economic upliftment of the people living in the Hmar dominated areas. Peace was thus restored in Mizoram after the signing of the Accord.

**3. Formation of HPC(D) :**

 However, inspite of the Peace Accord, there were still a disgruntled section of the HPC set up, led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate, the then General Secretary of the HPC who were not ready to accept the Peace Accord. Lalhmingthanga Sanate formed a militant outfit called the Hmar Peoples Convention (Democratic) (HPC(D)) in 1996 with its nerve centre at Hmarkhawlian (Lakhipur) in Cachar District of Assam. The HPC(D) was formed with the political objective of renewing demand for ADC under the active patronage of NSCN(IM).

**4. Split in Hmar Peoples Convention (Democrat) [HPC(D)]**

 HPC(D) has split into two factions on 29.9.2011. One faction is led by H.Zosangbera, Gen. Secretary and another faction by the deposed President Lalhmingthanga Sanate.

**5.****Signing of Memorandum of Settlement (MoS)**

****

******After a couple of Peace Dialogue between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D), on 2.4.2018 @ 4:30 p.m, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D), H.Zosangbera’s Faction signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) at the function held at the State Guest House, Aizawl. The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC(D) was held at CTI, Sesawng on 12th April, 2018 where 102 Cadres and 12 Council Members of HPC(D) come to over ground at this ceremony.**

**6. Lalhmingthanga Sanate’s Faction**

****

****Executive Council Emergency Meeting of HPC(D) held on **29.9.2011** impeached its President Lalhmingthang Sanate for signing a Deed of Agreement to join the KNO camp without consulting the HPC(D) Executive Council, the highest policy maker of the HPC(D) organization. This led to the splitting of HPC(D) into 2 (two) factions as mentioned above.

 Lalhmingthanga Sanate’s faction is still active (barely) in the bordering areas of Mizoram and Manipur. This faction, around a dozen in numbers can be branded only as an ‘armed gang’ having no legitimate political cause.
