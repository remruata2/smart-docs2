No. MSB/CB/B-19(A)/    Dated Aizawl, the June, 2014

To,

 The Under Secretary,

 Govt. of Mizoram

 Home Department, Mizoram, Aizawl

Subject: Provision for house guard in the official residence of Pu Lal Dingliana, Chief Information Commissioner, MIC.

Ref: No:D.32019/14/2013-HMP dt.2.6.2014.

Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, I am submitting herewith the assessment of threat perception in respect of Pu Lal Dingliana, Chief Information Commissioner, MIC for your kind information and necessary action.

 In the course of stringent assessment conducted, careful examination on the apprehended person, Lalhmangaihzuala and the police personnel involved in his apprehension along with civilians witnesses at the time of the incident was conducted and it was ascertained after medical examination that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of committing the mischief. It can be assumed that had the accused really tried to commit serious crime against Pu Lal Dingliana or his properties, he would have waited for late night when the street were empty and without being drunk. He also admitted that his action on that night were due to his drunkenness. When he was caught red handed by CIC, he claimed to be searching for his uncle whom he referred as ‘Pu Lal Thanhawla’ which clearly indicated him as not being able to use his conscience properly. Feasibility for providing house guards in this case was conducted and the residence of Pu Lal Dinglaina was also carefully examined.

 The residence of Pu Lal Dingliana is located at Mc Donald Hill, Zarkawt, opposite to Zarkawt Presbyterian Church, the residence of Pu Lal Dingliana is a three storeyed building which are all occupied by his families and is situated on the side of the main road leading to Mizoram Chief Minister Bungalow. A small courtyard which hosts a small garage barely enough for one car is in front of the main door. The front side of the house facing the main road is surrounded by iron grill fencing roughly four feet high, which is not much of a problem to any one willing to enter inside.

 Considering the facts related to the present CIC, his position in the Government could be deemed as among the top of Government officials and certainly entitled to providing house guards. However, at the moment, if such house guards are to be provided, which probably would be, around five armed constables with two NCOs, problems would arise for their accommodations. Although, the CIC residence might be able to vacate their garage which is situated in their basement for these armed personnel, the said garage is equipped with a rolling shutter for entry with no other windows which is out of question for using as a barrack/guard room as the occupants will have to open it after every two hours due to the shifting of their duty timings. Besides, no bathroom facilities are available in this garage not to mention any water supply.

 It is further learnt that after he is posted as CIC, no person had been awarded any punishment as a result of information given out by his commission till date which reduces his personal threat as a CIC.

Yours faithfully,
