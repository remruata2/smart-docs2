****SPECIAL REPORT ON NEWLY FORMED INSURGENT GROUP****

****No.MSB/CB/B-5/2025/054

 Dated: 4th February, 2025

A new Bru insurgent group, Tripura Ham Bagra TA Army (THBTA), has been reported to emerge in Tripura, comprising around 50 members, including 20 Bru refugees from Mizoram. The group is led by Phillip Ryoung (formerly Auto rickshaw driver) from Bandarima Village, North Tripura District, Tripura.

1. **Bru issues in Mizoram and Background of THBTA Formation**

The Bru Issues in Mizoram is deeply rooted in the demand for autonomy in Mizoram and the subsequent violence that erupted in 1997. The Bru National Union (BNU) had sought the creation of an Autonomous District Council for Brus in western Mizoram, which was met with strong opposition from the Mizo community. This led to the formation of the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) in 1996 and engaged in various activities, including robbery, assault on innocent civilians, and frequent extortion through demand letters directed at the Mizo population in western Mizoram which subsequently resulted in communal violence, forcing thousands of Bru people to flee Mizoram and seek refuge in Tripura. However, the Government of Mizoram initiated peace talks and BNLF members surrendered to Government of Mizoram on 25th July, 2005. Another Bru insurgent i.e Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM) was also formed but surrendered on 26th October, 2006.

In the meantime, there was another insurgent group i.e. National Liberation Front Of Tripura (NLFT) which was formed in 12th March, 1989 in Tripura. The NLFT sought to secede from India and establish an independent Tripuri state. After a series of peace talks, Tripura Peace Accord, a tripartite accord was signed on 10th August 2019 by the Government of India, Government of Tripura and the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) to end the insurgency. However, there are some discontented faction and continued their insurgencies. On 4th September 2024, the remaining faction of NLFT along with All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF) signed the 2024 Tripura Peace Accord with Government of India, Government of Tripura ending the 35 year old Insurgency in Tripura.

1. **Formation of Tripura Ham Bagra TA Army (THBTA)**

The formation of THBTA is linked to the exclusion of certain individuals from the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) cadre list, which was submitted to the Tripura State Government as part of the Peace Accord signed on 4th September, 2024. These individuals, aggrieved by their exclusion and hoping for government rehabilitation, entered Bangladesh with the intention of forming new insurgent group. Sister Intelligence Agency indicated that the main aim of THBTA is to carve out North Tripura District from Tripura and form a Bru state.

1. **Cadre strength and Camp of THBTA**

The cadre strength of THBTA is estimated at around 50 (fifty) personnel and it is reported that out of these 50 personnel, there are around 20 (twenty) Brus from Mizoram who were displaced to Tripura. Sources have also indicated that THBTA are possessing two (2) firearms but the number of firearms holdings may have increase. It is also reported that THBTA are having camps at Old Zopui and New Zopui under Baghaichhari PS, Rangamati District, Bangladesh.

1. **Activities of THBTA**

By the end of November 2024, THBTA had threatened several Bengali and Bru contractors in the Bandarima area, North Tripura District, Tripura, by phone, claiming to act on behalf of Phillip Ryoung. They demanded payment of 20% of the contractors' estimated earnings, warning of severe repercussions if their demands were not met. As a result of these threatening calls, the contractors filed a complaint at Ananda Bazar Police Station, North Tripura District, Tripura. 

As of January 28, 2025, THBTA has collected donations within Tripura. However, no activities have been reported within Mizoram. Additionally, there are indications that THBTA plans to conduct mass recruitment, although no such recruitment has taken place in Mizoram till date.

1. **Potential threat issues for Mizoram**

1. It has been reported that THBTA has conducted recruitment among Brus in Tripura. So, THBTA conducting recruitment discreetly among Brus in Mizoram cannot be ruled out.

1. THBTA has made financial demands among Contractors in Tripura and it is reported that they have started to engage in extortion among the Brus in Tripura. There is a great concern that they may also extend their extortion among the Mizo villages in Jampui Hills, North Tripura District, Tripura. In any such event, there is possibility of communal issue between the Mizos and Brus, particularly in Mamit and Kolasib Districts of Mizoram, disrupting the prevailing peaceful condition of the state.

1. Being a newly formed insurgent group, THBTA will be needing finances for procuring arms and ammunitions, conducting recruitment and training, etc. So, there is apprehension that they might also resort to kidnapping and extortion at the tri-border areas of Mizoram, Tripura and Bangladesh within W.Phaileng sub-division, Mamit District.

The activities of THBTA are being closely monitored to ensure public safety and prevent any potential threats for the state in particular and the nation as a whole.
