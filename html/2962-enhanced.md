****REPORT ON MIZORAM BORDER DEFENCE ARMY(MBDA)****

Lalhmingthanga Sanate, Founder President of Hmar People Convention (Democratic), presently residing with his family members at Hmarkhawlian, Cachar District, Assam (who refused to over ground during the Peace Accord signed by HPC(D) and government of Mizoram in the year 2018) held a meeting with RC Singson @ Ramchanlova (former Army Chief of HPC(D)) of Thenzawl, Mizoram on 15.12.2021 at Hmarkhawlian, Assam in connection with the tense Mizoram-Assam inter-state border situation. After discussing the matter at length, the duo decided to raise new outfit in the name of “Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA)” with the following plan of actions:

1. To launch attack against Assam Police deployed along Assam-Mizoram border with Arms.
2. To threaten/intimidate Non-mizos residing along the Assam-Mizoram border.
3. To procure arms and ammunitions from National Socialist Council of Nagaland –NSCN (IM).
4. To collect donation from residents of Saiphai, Mizoram and its surrounding areas for procurement of arms and ammunitions.

Following the above decision, RC Singson, Commissioner/Commander -in-Chief of MBDA, along with the following persons served ‘Demand Letter’ using HPC (D) Letter Head to Non-mizo residents of Chemphai and Saiphai, Kolasib district and its surrounding areas during the concluding part of December, 2021:

1. Lalngaisanga @ Sangtea - SS Commander
2. Lalhriatzuala of Saiphai, Kolasib district, Mizoram
3. Jamal- SS Pvt. MBDA, Saipum, Kolasib district, Mizoram
4. Basir, SS Pvt. MBDA (Address unknown)
5. Zodawlliana @ Dawla, Saiphai, Kolasib district, Mizoram

The above mentioned persons were armed with 1 (one) .32 Pistol and 1 (one) Miniature (.22 Rifle) mounted with Telescope while serving the ‘Demand Letter’ and they extorted money amounting to Rs. 52,000/- from various persons.

On 25.1.2022, Mizoram Police nabbed the following 2 (two) persons engaged in the stated extortion: Lalhriatzuala, Saiphai and Sunday Lalrinsanga, Saiphai, and the below noted items were also seized from their possession:

1. 1(one) no. of AK-47 Magazine and 3(three) rounds of ammunitions
2. 4 (four) nos. of Mobile Phones
3. 3(three) rounds of Miniature (.22Rifle).

However, the below mentioned persons managed to evade arrest:

1. Lalngaisanga @Sangtea, SS Commander, MBDA
2. Jamal, SS Pvt. MBDA of Saipum
3. Basir, SS Pvt. MBDA (Address unknown)

In connection with the above incident, Vairengte PS C/No.3/2022 u/s 395 IPC r/w 25(1A) Arms Act Dt. 26.1.2022 has been registered. The following day, i.e., 27.1.2022, RC Singson, Commissioner/Commander -in-Chief of MBDA was arrested by Mizoram Police and all the 3 (three) arrested accused were remanded into Judicial Custody on 29.1.2022.

However, the above mentioned 3 (three) absconding accused persons are still on the run and attempts are being undertaken for their immediate arrest. It is strongly suspected that their hideout is within Assam territory.

It is pertinent to mention in this regard that the outfit named Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA) was raised and coined by Lalhmingthanga Sanate, founder President, HPC (D), in his attempt to take personal advantage of the recently tensed Assam-Mizoram inter-state border situation. It may also be worth mentioning that investigation of the above mentioned case revealed that cadre of Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA) implanted explosives attached with detonator (approx. 2 kgs), which was recovered near the construction site of a Bridge connecting PuChalchhunga’s farm land to Pu Lalnuntluanga’s farm land across Saihapui river, Phainuam-Buarchep area on 6.11.2021 @10:25 a.m.

In view of the above, immediate arrest of Lalhmingthanga Sanate, founder President, HPC (D) and the absconding accused is considered the need of the hour as they may pose threat to internal security of both states viz. Mizoram and Assam, and Non-mizos residing along the inter-state border and Assam Police deployed along the inter-state border. It is, therefore, suggested that necessary action may kindly be taken by Assam Police to affect arrest and initiate appropriate legal action against the said Lalhmingthanga Sanate and the above-mentioned absconded persons.
