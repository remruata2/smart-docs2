**Threat perception assessment of AR Ground and Raj Bhavan**

Threat perception assessment of AR Ground &amp; Raj Bhavan was thoroughly conducted and it was found that since there is no new instruction from the higher authority in regard to duty deployment of the Independence Day, the deployment is likely to be arranged much the same as the previous year’s arrangement i.e. starting from the previous day’s evening till the morning of celebration’s day, there will be AR Ground duty of MRP personnel and also during the said hours, a patrolling groups of party from all Police stations within the city will also be deployed. Subsequently, the said two security deployments ahead of the Celebration day will be relieved by the normal duty deployments of the actual celebration day. Likewise, as of now, city area patrolling from Police stations within the city as well as other static security deployment in or around AR Ground is not yet set out and situation is the same for Raj Bhavan which is reportedly heavily guarded by Assam Rifles’ armed personnel. Additionally, it was also reported that Parade contingents for the said celebration day had already begun their practice session on the AR ground starting from 7:00 am till 9-10:00 am in the morning.

 It is then learnt that in regard to the upcoming Independence Day Celebration of 2019 at AR Ground and Raj Bhavan, advanced security deployments other than the normal routine patrolling from each P/S is not yet to be found.
