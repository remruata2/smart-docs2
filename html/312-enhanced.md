**1. Pu K.Lianzuala, ex MLA and Chairman, MKVI Board :**

******Being Chairman of MKVI Board, he often faced certain disgruntled persons who are disappointed at not receiving funds or loans from the Board, which cannot be treated much as a threat to his life.. However, as a Chairman of MKVI Board and a prominent politician , he like the other two protected persons mentioned below, his time schedule involves visiting different places throughout the state where he often takes his PSO along with him. He further claimed that his designation as a Chairman of MKVI Board is equivalent to state minister which entitled him a PSO. It seems that the main reason for his desire to have a PSO is to have an extra hand when traveling from place to place rather than from security point of view. Apart from this, no immediate threat is found to exist against him.**

**2. Pu Lalduhawma,President, ZNP :**

****Pu Lalduhawma, Ex MLA has been provided one PSO after his request for it with the pretext of having threat from undesirable elements way back in 2015. However, he had not received any more threat from any person these days. He often visited his farm located at Sihhmui and according to him, Sihhmui area is prone to arms smugglers and insurgents as a hide out (Arrest of insurgents and seizure of arms were done in previous years in the vicinity) in which he as an ex-MLA and President of ZNP, needs some protection just in case. Apart from this, to attend party matters, traveling from one place to another throughout Mizoram is a common thing for him where a possibility for him in encountering human obstacles is always there which may not be appropriate for him to tackle it personally from his position as a politician.

**3. Prof. JV Hluna, President, BJP Mizoram Pradesh :**

******At present, Prof. JV Hluna, State President, BJP Mizoram Pradesh is being provided one PSO after Government of Mizoram obliged to his request for it. The PSO was provided to him after a mis understanding arose between him and Students organizations of Mizoram regarding declaration of Khuangchera as Indian freedom fighter by BJP. His effigy was even torched by members of the student organizations on 18th Aug. 2016. The misunderstanding, however ended peacefully with no other untoward incidents.**

 As far as that incident is concerned, threat against Pu JV Hluna can be considered as nil. He himself admitted that as long as he is inside Aizawl city, his requirement of PSO is minimal.

 On the other hand, being State President of BJP, Prof JV Hluna needs to travel a lot inside Mizoram, visiting various party units and members sometimes at night through out Mizoram especially as MLA election for Mizoram Legislative Assembly is drawing nearer.

**Conclusion:** Although no imminent threats are found to exist against the three protected persons at the moment, it may be concluded that whether threat against them existed or not, each of them would like to have an extra hand or an aide at their disposal when moving around especially when they considered themselves with their designation.
