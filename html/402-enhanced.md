****BRIEF NOTE ON THE DEMANDED SINLUNG HILLS AUTONOMOUS DISTRICT COUNCIL.****

** Hmar People Convention (HPC) was formed on Dt.3.7.1986 at Sakawrdai, Aizawl District with the aim of creating Autonomous District Council in Hmar tribes inhabited areas of north eastern and western part of Mizoram, bordering Assam and Manipur which comprise 26 (twenty six) villages within Mizoram state. After struggling to achieve their objective by resorting to arms/ violence for 5 (five) consecutive years w.e.f. 1989 with 13 (thirteen) rounds of peace talks between the HPC and the Government of Mizoram, Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed between the two parties on 27.7.1994 which resulted into the setting up of Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) in 1997. However, certain members of HPC, led by Pu Lalhmingthanga Sanate of Khawlian village, who were disgruntled with the MoS, signed in 1994, had formed **HPC (Democratic) in 1996**.**

 The HPC (D) had split into two factions on 29.9.2011 following the impeachment of its president, Lalhmingthanga Sanate for signing a Deed of Agreement to join the Kuki National Organization (KNO). One faction is led by H.Zosangbera, Gen. Secretary and the other by the deposed President, Lalhmingthanga Sanate.

The outfit, despite their demand for an Autonomous District Council inside Mizoram, located their Hqrs. / hideout at Sibapurikhal (Ankhachhuah) in Manipur as well as Hmarkhawlian in Assam state.

 The HPC-D intensified their criminal activities since early January 2012 by interfering in the Village Council (V/C) election within their demand area for which State Election Commission was compelled to postpone election for V/C of 13 (thirteen) villages within Aizawl District and 2 (two) other villages from Kolasib District. Besides, the HPC-D forcibly dissolved as many as 37 (thirty-seven) YMA Branches within their demand areas. They also collected force donation from V/Cs, Govt Employees and Contractors within their demand areas which draw the attention of the Government. Accordingly, the top 3 (three) leaders viz. 2 (two) armed wing leaders namely S/S Army Chief Ropuia and S/S Dy. Army Chief Biaknunga were arrested at Silchar Airport on 10.6.2012 and H. Zosangbera, Chairman of HPC ‘D’, at IGI Airport, New Delhi on 17.7.2012. The 3 (three) leaders had been kept under judicial custody. S/S Army Chief Lalropuia was released on bail on 21.11.2012 on medical ground. Thereafter the other 2 (two) were also released on bail on 6.2.2013.

 The Government of Mizoram, so far, had held 2 (two) rounds of peace talk with the HPC (D). The first round of talk was held on 11.11.2010 at State Guest House, Aizawl in which Suspension of Operation (SoO) was signed for a period of 6 (six) months w.e.f. 11.11.2010. The second round of talk was held on 31.1.2013 at State Guest House and SoO was again signed for a period of 6 (six) months w.e.f. 31.1.2013 which may be extended by mutual consent.

 One development worth mentioning here is that Sinlung Hills Autonomous District Council Demand Committee (SHADCDC) had been founded, under the reported aegis of Rosiama’s faction of Hmar Peoples’ Conference, in the month of May 2012 under the leadership of Pu Lalmalsawma Darngawn. The SHADCDC, led by their chairman, Pu Lalmalsawma Darngawn, held a press conference on Dt.11.3.2013 at the Aizawl Press Club announcing that steps and efforts taken by them for the setting up of Sinlung Hills Autonomous District Council and their intention of submitting a Memorandum to the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India in this regards.
