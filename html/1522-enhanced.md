****ENQUIRY REPORT ON ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF PCJSS****

**1.** According to information received, PCJSS are intending to re-group and to revitalise their cadres, the exact place and time of which is not finalised yet. However, what is ascertained is that it will not be inside Mizoram and that it will likely be along the Indo-Bangladesh border areas.

**2.** The said, Raja Laksmi Prasad, Contact No.9612017390 is indeed a member of PCJSS Central Committee but has no designation in Armed Wing/Armed Cadre. The in-charge of Armed Wing and Training of PCJSS are Lt.Col. Ketu Babu Chakma and Major Osim Chakma.

 Based on technical report, the location of Raja Lakshmi Prasad till today are as under :

 As for the given map co-ordinate (ie, 220 56' 00"N 920 39' 00"E), according to Google Map, falls in between Kawmzawl and Saza IB, Lunglei District and not on Parva-2 village, Lawngtlai District, Mizoram. Moreover, the location of Raja Lakshmi Prasad, (from tracking his mobile No. 9612017390) is in between South Sabual and Buarpui in Lunglei District on 25.1.2021. As on yesterday, ie, 27.1.2021, his location is inside Lunglei Town area and has not been to Parva in the past few days. (_Google Map location is also enclosed._)

 Further information received indicated that PCJSS has no Transit Camp in and around Parva area. Prior to 2018, a camp was established by them near Kamtuli village, which is now completely vacated.

 Closing their cadres from the Southern parts of Bangladesh, PCJSS are planning to re-group these cadres in Panchuri Diginala Camp, Bangladesh. The main reason behind this decision is because of the intense activities of their rival Chakma Militant outfit, UPDF (United People Democratic Front) in Bandarban District, which is located in the Southern parts of Bangladesh.

**3.** Information from civilian source indicated that PCJSS had not established any Camps around Parva - 1, 2 &amp; 3 areas apart from their camp near Kamtuli village which was abandoned in 2018. It may also be mentioned that Parva-1 is inhabited by Chakmas with around 300 houses, Parva-2 is around 80 houses of Bru families and 60 houses in Parva-3 which is inhabited by Bawm.

 A detachment of vigilant Assam Rifles and BSF personnel along with staff of SIB are presently stationed in Parva - 2 areas. As such, it is unlikely that PCJSS will set up Camps in these areas under the watchful eyes of these armed para-military forces and in an area dominated and inhabited by Brus.
