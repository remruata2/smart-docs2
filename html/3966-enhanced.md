_Inter-Group Clash Between PCJSS and UPDF(P) in Rangamati: One Dead, Several Injured :_

On the morning of 06 June at approximately 8:30 AM, a gunfire exchange occurred between the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) and the United People's Democratic Front (Progressive), UPDF(P) at Bangaltuli Union, Baghaichari Upazila, under Rangamati District.

During the incident, one UPDF(P) cadre was killed on the spot. Additionally, one AK-47 rifle was recovered by PCJSS personnel at the site. Two other members of the UPDF(P) sustained serious bullet injuries in the confrontation.

Tragically, a five-year-old child was also reported injured by gunfire allegedly fired by UPDF(P) during the exchange.

All PCJSS personnel involved in the operation withdrew safely following the incident. A contingent of the Bangladesh Army subsequently arrived at the location to verify and assess the situation.

From April to June 2025, the Lawngtlai border region has seen growing militant buildup, military encroachment, and cross-border alliances involving radical Islamist groups. With the establishment of fortified army camps and militant training zones across the border, the threat to Mizoram’s internal security, communal harmony, and national sovereignty has intensified. A strong, multi-layered response blending technology, border policing, community vigilance, and regional cooperation is urgently required to safeguard the region.

****Report on Recent KNF/A Arms Deal, New Camp, and JAFHS Alliance -****

It has been learned that the KNF/A (also referred to as KCNA) recently completed an arms deal involving 18 Myanmar-made MA-3 rifles and an unspecified quantity of ammunition. The weapons were reportedly purchased from Myanmar-based insurgent groups, whose identities are yet to be confirmed. Out of the 18 rifles, five along with some ammunition have been shifted to the KNF/A headquarters at Rengtlang, while the remaining 13 rifles are currently hidden in an undisclosed location outside Hruitezawl village in Lawngtlai District.

Meanwhile, on 18 May, villagers of Chhippui discovered two abandoned bags near the international border (IB) and handed them over to the Border Security Force (BSF) at Chhippui Border Outpost (BOP). Upon inspection, BSF personnel recovered 100 rounds of 7.62mm and 150 rounds of 5.56mm ammunition from the bags.

Reports further indicate that KNF/A has declared Rengtlang (Botgach Mura) as its new headquarters and has re-established strong ties with the Islamist militant group, Jamatul Ansar Fil Hindal Sharqiya (JAFHS). Reliable sources reveal that several JAFHS cadres are currently stationed at Rengtlang alongside KNF/A members and are planning to undergo fresh training under the KNF/A.

The newly established KNF/A camp is situated atop the Rengtlang hill range in the Barthali Union under Bilaichari Upazila, near the international border adjacent to Chhippui, CADC. Presently, approximately 30 KNF/A cadres and 18 JAFHS cadres are stationed at the camp, equipped with around 5–7 assault rifles, including AK-47s and MA-3s.

 It is also reported that KNF/A has received a sum of 1 crore Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) from JAFHS in support of mutual interests. In this context, KNF/A is actively seeking to procure additional arms and ammunition from rebel groups operating in Myanmar. ****

**SAC Military Movements and Resistance –**

 As of June 2025, intense fighting continues in Chin State, Myanmar, between the State Administration Council (SAC) military forces and a coalition of resistance groups known as the Chin Brotherhood Alliance. This alliance includes the Chinland Defense Force (CDF), Chin National Defence Force (CNDF), and various local People's Defence Forces (PDFs) where Sizang PDF are participated as Majority.

The SAC deployed approximately 600 troops aiming to advance into Chin State. However, their progress was halted near Mualpi, close to a coffee plantation, due to strong resistance from the Chin Brotherhood and allied forces. In retaliation, SAC forces reportedly burned down Mualpi Village in Tedim Township, leading to significant civilian displacement.

**Current Situation –**

 The resistance now controls a significant portion of Chin State, with the SAC's presence largely confined to isolated areas. Despite this, the SAC continues to conduct airstrikes in an attempt to regain lost territory. The situation remains fluid, with both sides preparing for potential escalations. The Chin Brotherhood Alliance continues to fortify its positions, while the SAC seeks to reclaim control through military offensives.
