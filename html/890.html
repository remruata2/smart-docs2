REPORT ON ALLEGED SETTING UP OF CAMP(S) BY ARAKAN<br />
ARMY (AA) INSIDE MIZORAM<br />
Information has been received from Sister Intelligence Agency that the AA (Arakan<br />
Army) is setting up camps at Kakichhuah areas, along the Indo-Myanmar border on Mizoram<br />
soil. In this regard, an enquiry was conducted to ascertain the stated input.<br />
Pu Vanlalmawia of Hruitezawl Village was engaged and he personally visited<br />
Kakichhuah and its surrounding areas on 19.12.2019 &amp; 20.12.2019. He contacted several<br />
reliable persons residing in the areas and as per his report there is no evidence to suggest the<br />
existence of AA camp inside Mizoram.<br />
Pu Laltlanchhuaha, VCP, Kakichhuah was contacted through telephone and he stated<br />
that there is no AA Camp in Kakichhuah or its surrounding areas, such as, Sabualtlang. He,<br />
however, pointed out that there were 2-3 AA camps at Kakichhuah areas during 2018 and the<br />
AA Cadres were also frequently being sighted during 2018. He reported that those camps<br />
were vacated during the concluding period of 2018 due to frequent clashes between AA and<br />
Myanmar Army and due to heightened presence of Indian security forces in the areas. The<br />
Village Council leaders were informed to keep close vigil on possible presence of AA on<br />
Indian soil.<br />
Known AA leaders were also contacted and they reported that they have no camp<br />
inside Mizoram and reiterated that they have no intention to establish camp(s) in Mizoram in<br />
the foreseeable future. As per input, the nearest AA camp inside Myanmar is around 15 kms<br />
from the Indo-Myanmar border.<br />
