****LAW AND ORDER SITUATION IN AIZAWL DISTRICT****

****FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS****

*************

 Mizoram is one of the most peaceful States in the country. In fact in the strife-torn North East India, Mizoram can boast of being the least militant infected State mainly because the budding militancy have been nabbed by Mizoram Police in its infant stage. This being the case, there was no major law and order breakout caused by activities of the militants and the agitating bodies/associations for the last five years. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mizoram is free of any insurgent and militant activities. Activities of militant and agitating bodies/associations under Aizawl district and how the police had dealt with those activities may be summarised as under:

**HPC(D)**:

 The Hmar Peoples Convention(Democrat) a militant group having base in Manipur and Cachar bordering the northern part of Mizoram revived its activities since 2007 in the form of sending demand letters to some Village Councils of northern villages of Aizawl district and later on collecting the so-called annual taxes at the rate of Rs.100/- per household and Rs.200/- each from Govt. servants inside the demand area falling under Mizoram State. Some of the village councils had submitted the demanded money under duress. Criminal cases have been registered at the concerned Police stations. No arrest, however, have yet been made. Mizoram, having a porous border with neighboring States, entry or passing through by other N.E insurgent groups cannot be ruled out.

  On 4.3.2007, HPC(D) militants killed 6(six) Hmar National Assembly(HNA) cadres on the bank of Tuiruang river inside Tinghmun village council area after they were kidnapped by their assailants on 21.2.2007 because of the factional rivalry.

**Kuki Liberation Army(KLA)**:

 On 26.2.2008, dead body of one Thangcha Kigpen(40) S/o Semkhopau Kigpen of Sadar Hills, Manipur was found in front of MNF party office Aizawl. It was later learnt that he was killed by his comrades due to alleged misappropriation of the KLA fund.

**ACTIVITIES OF NGOs ETC**:

 Besides the above activities mentioned, activities of NGOs etc. may also be summarised as under:

 The Long March from Hnahthial bound for Aizawl organised by Hnahthial District Demand Committee was started on 24.4.2008 and displayed placards and posters demanding official functioning of Hnahthial district and reached their final destination i.e. MSU General Headquarters, Aizawl on 26.4.2008. Mass Hunger Strike was started on 28.4.2008 and called off on 17.5.2008. No un-towards incident happened.

 The MSU activists in protest against the recruitment procedures of teaching and non-teaching staff of MZU accused the V.C for violating the agreement which they had with him some time ago, set effigy of V.C on fire on 17.5.2010. Again on the morning of 18.5.2010 about 70 members of MSU activists surrounded the residence of the V.C preventing him from coming out of the house to go to his office to attend the ongoing recruitment. 60 members of MSU were arrested out of which 46 of them were remanded into judicial custody. The remaining members of MSU again agitated in protest against the arrest of their members and organised sit-in demonstration in front of Vanapa Hall.

 Certain labour unions namely National Trade Union of Mizoram, Federation of Mizoram Trade Union, Centre of Trade Union of Mizoram and Mizoram Labour Union combined and styled themselves as Mizoram Trade Union Joint Action Committee(MTUJAC) had staged a hunger strike demonstration from 14.3.2011 to 21.3.2011 demanding implementation of minimum wages rate recommended by the concerned Board and reinstatement of MR workers sacked by some departments. Some incidents, however, presumably the handiworks of extreme members of MTUJAC had taken place such as - On 10.3.2011@11:50pm, 33KV double power line located at Thuampui, Aizawl was attacked with explosives/bomb but fortunately caused no damage. On 18.3.2011@10:45pm, 250KVA Transformer at Rangvamual was attacked with explosives believed to be gelatine. No major damaged was caused except leakage of oil chamber. Timely collection of intelligence reports have prevented such further incidents.

 During the last five years, the following arms and ammunitions have been recovered and seized by police in Aizawl district:

 1) Firearms of different types - 96 nos.

 2) Different kinds of ammunitions - 10270 nos.

 3) Gelatine Sticks - 1114 nos.

 4) Detonators - 766 nos.

 In the ongoing drive against benami traders by the NGOs, the Central Young Mizo Association on 10.8.2011 had served a notice to all benami traders to legalise their business before the end of August 2011. At the same time, on 10.8.2011, the North East Minority Students' Association sent a letter to the Chief Minister of Assam accusing the Mizoram NGOs of harassing the Bengali speaking traders in Mizoram and requested him to take necessary action lest they will do by themselves. The border area development minister of Assam, Mr. Siddique Ahmed was also reportedly been saying such statement and discussed the matter with Assam Chief Minister, Mr. Tarun Gogoi. The minister was also quoted as telling the media persons that the YMA and MZP have checked the ILP of manual workers hailing from Barak area and notified them to quit Mizoram and such notice caused unrest among the non-Mizos. Meanwhile, The Mizoram Muslim Welfare Society, an apex body of Muslims living in Mizoram strongly condemn the false accusation of any such harassment. The development in this regard/matter is kept under close watch.

 It could well be concluded that inspite of the activities of militant in some pocket of the district and the agitation and strike called by students body or trade union, there was no major breakout of law and order problems which paralysed the normal life of the general public during the last five years.
