****Enquiry Report in connection with Lunglei P/S C/No. 90/24 dt.10.05.2024 u/s 20(b) (ii) (B)/ 29 ND &PS Act :****

 In connection with the above mentioned case, four accused persons , who are all drivers by professions, were carefully examined. They were :

 a) Joseph Hmangaihsanga (31) s/o Simon Zoduhsanga, Chawnpui, Aizawl.

 b) Khupminlian (20) s/o Ginzalal, Madanwriting, Shillong.

 c) Lallawmawma (38) s/o Vanlalrema,Vaivakawn, Aizawl.

 d) Lalbiakliana (28) s/o Thanglalrema, Bawngkawn Brigade, Aizawl.

 From the light of the examination, Khupminliana visited Aizawl from Shillong on dt.20.4.2024 and stayed at the residence of Pu Puia, Chanmari West, Aizawl where he became aware of the lucrative business of Ganja smuggling from one of his friend. On dt.06.04.2024, through one contact number (Ganja supplier) provided to him by his friend, he ordered 12 Kgs. of Ganja which was delivered to him at Dawrpui, Aizawl using a scooty by one non-Mizo (who was unknown to him) on dt.08.04.2024 at the rate of â‚¹23,000. Later, as one of his friend, Joseph Hmangaihsanga claimed that he can sell off the contraband (Ganja) at Lunglei areas at the rate of â‚¹ 8,000 per Kg. they proceeded towards Lunglei town from Aizawl after borrowing one Duster car from one person, Dika of Zotlang, Aizawl on the night of dt.09.05.2024.

 On the morning of dt.10.05.2024, Khupminliana and Joseph Hmangaihsanga, accompanied by Lallawmawma and Lalbiakliana were apprehended at around 5:30 am near Eldorado Building, Lunglei Bazar veng by Lunglei DSB Staff along with 13.01 Kgs. of Ganja which they were transporting using a Duster car.

 From the interrogation result of these accused persons, the smuggled Ganja are evidently transported from Shillong , Meghalaya although Khupminlian, the person who received it from the supplier strongly denied knowing the person who send them to him in the first place. One of the co-accused, Joseph Hmangaihsanga also claimed that he was not sure of the exact person to whom their smuggled goods were to be handed over during that time. As such, to further enquire the source of the seized Ganja, the mobile No. CDR of Khupminlian s/o Ginzalal, Madanwriting, Shillong and Joseph Hmangaihsanga s/o Simon Zoduhsanga, Chawnpui, Aizawl whose Mobile Numbers are 8798210754 and 9366628314 respectively need to be analysed.
