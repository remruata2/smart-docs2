**ACT EAST POLICY - SECURITY CHALLENGES AND PREPAREDNESS**

Look East Policy of India was launched by the former Prime Minister P.V Narasimha Rao in 1991. The main focus of this policy was to shift the country’s trading focus from the west and neighbors to the booming South East Asian countries. This policy continues till the formation NDA government in 2014. Since the formation of the new government in the centre, the government transformed it to “Act East Policy” and it was launched at the East Asia Summit in Myanmar in November, 2014. It is a diplomatic initiative to promote economic, strategic and cultural relations with the vast Asia-Pacific region at different levels.

**Act East Policy and Mizoram**:

Mizoram shared 496.531 kms. boundary with Myanmar and could be the gateway to the South East Asian countries once the projects under Act East Policy are completed due to its strategic location. Despite having occupied a strategic place in the AEP for it ‘high standards’ of human development indices such as literacy rate and sex ratio, infrastructural deficit however it still remains acute. Mizoram is predominantly an agrarian state like most of the other states of Northeast with more than 70 percent of its population engaged in agriculture. Although it is one of the fastest growing economies of India with a growth rate of above 8 percent since 2014, improvement in agricultural productivity has remained marginal. The industrial sector has not grown as a result of lack of infrastructure and scarce availability of raw material. The contribution of the tourism sector to the economy of Mizoram is also very less due to the geographical isolation of the State. The intra-state connectivity remains poor. For instance it takes nearly four hours to cover 80 kilometres of distance between southern part of Mizoram capital Lunglei and Lawngtlai. Mizoram conducts virtually no trade with either the mainland or neighbouring countries. It was therefore imperative for the AEP to ‘bridge the distances’ physically and economically in Mizoram.

**Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project****(KMMTTP):**

The most vital and visible manifestation of Act East Policy is the KMMTTP. TheKaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Projectis a project that will connect the eastern Indian seaport of KolkatawithSittweseaport inRakhine State, Myanmar by sea. In Myanmar, it will then link Sittwe seaport toPaletwa,Chin Statevia the Kaladan riverboat route, and then from Paletwa by road toMizoramstate in Northeast India. Originally, the project was scheduled to be completed by 2014 but it has not been completed till today.

The project has several sections combining multi-modes of transport:

1. 539kms. shipping route from seaport ofKolkatainIndiatoSittweseaport inMyanmarviaBay of Bengal. This sea route has been operational for several decades.
2. 158kms. river boat route fromSittweseaport to Inland Water Terminal (IWT) atPaletwaJetty viaKaladan riverinMyanmar, (June 2017)
3. 110kms. road route from IWT Paletwa to Indo-Myanmar border inMyanmar. Construction contract awarded in June 2017.
4. 90kms. route from Indo-Myanmar border at Zorinpui to Aizawl-Saiha National Highway at Lawngtlai District, MizoraminIndiaby road onNational Highway 54 (India)(NH-54), which then continues further toDabakain Assamvia 850kms. long NH-54 which in turn is part of the largerEast-West Corridor connecting North East Indiawith the rest ofIndia.

This project will reduce distance fromKolkatatoSittweeby approximately 1328kms. and will reduce the need to transport good through the narrow Siliguricorridor, also known asChicken's Neck.

The project is being piloted and funded by theMinistry of External Affairs (India). The preliminary feasibility studies were carried out byRail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES). Construction work onSittwe port and the boat jetty inPaletwa, as well as the dredging work, will be executed by theInland Waterways Authority of India(IWAI), with Essar Projects Ltd, a division of theEssar Groupappointed in May 2010 as the main contractor.

 Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project initially faced problems such as under estimation of the road length inMyanmarand plans to construct hydro-electric projects —Chhimtuipui RiverandLungleng River— on two tributaries of theKaladan Riverfollowed by another project downstream. That the first two projects are being built by one public sector undertaking and the third is being constructed by another PSU (Public Sector Unit) has also led to coordination issues. Due to construction of this hydro-electrical project, Navigation of boats could be effected.

 The project includes a waterway component of 158kms. on Kaladan River from Sittwe to Paletwa in Myanmar and a road component of 109kms. from Paletwa to Zorinpui along the India-Myanmar border in Mizoram.

**Challenges and Preparedness:**

1. _Slow Progress of the KMMTTP_ :

There are many factors which attributed the slow progress to the project which are (i) long rainy season which resulted in shorter duration of construction of road in a year (ii) remoteness of the region in Mizoram which causes delays in the supply of fuel and spare parts, and further delaying the project.

 The factor which concerned with security is demand of compensation as many landlords in Lawngtlai are demanding compensation for the highway that supposedly passed over their lands and has resulted in blockades of the ongoing construction work on numerous occasions. Lawngtlai District Land Owners Association (LDLOA) was formed and commenced picketing against staff/workers of RDS Company and ARSS Company, Contractors engaged under KMMTTP on many occasions and sometimes blockade of road in protest against the alleged undue payment of compensation to LDLOA members.

1. _Militancy challenge in Myanmar_ :

Myanmar government was hesitant to begin KMMTTP work since the highway would pass through some areas where a rebel group called Arakan Army (AA) has a presence. R.D.S. Pvt. Ltd undertook road construction in between Zorinpui and Paletwa Myanmar and they are presently constructing 4.9 kms. out of the total 49 kms. to be constructed. This project would pass through Arakan Army (AA) Operational Area under Rakhine State. On the morning of 19.6.2020, while the construction work was going under the guard of Myanmar Army (MA), Arakan Army (AA) opened fire to Myanmar Army (MA), as per report some MA personnel sustained injury due to the attack. Manager and workers of company took shelter inside Mizoram and the work could not be resumed till date.

After the incident, resumption of the work was not allowed by Arakan Army (AA). It has been learnt that as long as India’s cooperate with Myanmar Army (MA), they would not allow continuing the work and demanded signing of tripartite agreement of representatives of Govt. of India, Official of Construction Company and Arakan Army (AA) in order to resume the work.

1. _Refugee problems_ :

Hundreds of refugees streamed into Mizoram following clashes between the Myanmar Army (MA) and the Arakan Army (AA) in the year 2017. The same case may happen again due to major attack of Myanmar Army (MA) by Arakan Army (AA) and also if the Myanmar Army (MA) launches any major operation there may be influx of refugees/AA into Mizoram. After completion of the KMMTTP there may be unabated influx of foreigner into Mizoram due to Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar.

1. _Cross Border Crime_ :

There may be increase in cross border crimes due to better road connectivity after completion of KMMTTP. This may open door for illegal activities such as Arms Smuggling, Human Trafficking, Drugs Smuggling and illegal migration of foreigners due to the very strategic location of Mizoram. It would be necessary to beef up the security along Myanmar and Mizoram border in order to restrain cross border crime once the project is completed.

1. _Beefing up of Border Security_ :

The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime(FMR) between India and Myanmar allows Myanmarese nationals to enter up to 16 kms. into Mizoram Territory without any Visa restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border and BSF guard Indo-Bangladesh border. Mizoram shared 496.531 Kms. with Myanmar and 319.791 Kms. with Bangladesh. In order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the border of Mizoram and Myanmar.

1. _Setting up Battalion Headquarters_ :

The 3rd Indian Reserve Battalion currently deployed at Assam is planning to set up its Headquarters at Thingkah, Lawngtlai District. Construction work of infrastructural need is going on, and it is expected to be completed soon. Once they are stationed at the new headquarters, they will be an important asset to maintain peace and security in the southern part of Mizoram. They would be very useful in Maintenance of Law &amp; Order and guarding of international boundary and cross border crime.
