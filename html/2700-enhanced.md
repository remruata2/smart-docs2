**_Enquiry report in connection with Myanmar nationals obtaining Aadhar Card by using_  _documents issued by Churches in Mizoram_**

 One account in a popular social media platform - Facebook, which is obviously a fake one, who goes by the name- Zoa Khiangte posted on Facebook group called Mizo Special Report, his personal experience about Myanmar Nationals obtaining Aadhar Card using documents issued by the Churches in Mizoram. While conducting investigation on this issue, some Church leaders in Mizoram, officials of Lengpui Airport, Aizawl Post Office and a couple of common service centers within Aizawl city were contacted for corroboration of the said Facebook post. Regarding this post, the following are the findings of this enquiry :-

1. Post Office staffs of Aizawl confirmed that they had received some names of Adhaar cards which are likely to be Chin people. When the cards were again sent to the concerned local councils for further dissemination, no adverse response had been received from the local councils till today.

1. After careful investigation, there are no Church leaders who claimed to have issued Baptisma Certificate to any Myanmar Nationals.

1. At Lengpui Airport, Myanmar Nationals those who utilized fake Aadhar Card for travel accesses were apprehended a few months earlier. Upon enquiry, some of these fake Aadhar Cards were made in Delhi using Photoshop editing software. Thereafter, in fear of apprehension, no other Myanmar Nationals tried to pass through Lengpui Airport and opted other means for travelling to Delhi . Airport authorities further expressed the lack of checking machines for genuine Aadhar Card and are done manually by Airport Police staffs.

1. Some operators of Common Service Centre in Aizawl pointed out excerpt of “The Aadhar Act, 2016” which stated that an individual who has resided in India for a period or period amounting in all to 152 days or more in the 12 months immediately preceding the date of application for enrolment can obtain Aadhar Card by submitting his demographic information and biometric information.

  Therefore, it is found that some of Myanmar Nationals who had been  staying more  than 12 months in India are eligible for obtaining Aadhar Cards as  per the Aadhar Act, 2016.
