The conference report that the road is used by several vehicles from outside Mizoram and as there is no check gate, travelers often brought in illegal abusive substances and other stuff without having to pay tax; the road is very convenient for vehicle robbers and they often used it to drive stolen vehicles out of Mizoram. Demand for check gate was also made last year but no action was taken and since the condition worsens, the delegates decided to renew the demand to the Government of Mizoram. </span></span></span></p>
