<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">3.10.2</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> A total of 29 Border Out Posts (BOPs) have been established under the MAP (4) and IRBs (25), along with 47 (MAP) and21 (IRB) Static Guards. The location of Police Stations, Police Out Posts and BOPs of the MAP/IRB should be plot on a map, along with the location of the existing and proposed BOPs of the BSF, with the aim of being able to see the disposition of the BSF and State Police BOPs in a composite manner, to see how the network of State BOPs, PSs and Ops, in conjunction with the BSF BOPs could be used as an effective second line of defence behind the border.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">3.10.3</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> With reference to the crime control functions of the local police, it was mentioned that the Central Scheme of CCTNS, which could also play an important role in tracking border crimes and criminals involved, had been substantially implemented in the State. However, there are serious limitations in respect of connectivity which is being provided, under the existing Scheme, through BSNL. The State Government has submitted a proposal to MHA for creating a V-Sat based network, along with a DPR, but they have been told by MHA to take up the matter under the Police Modernisation Scheme which the State Government does not find feasible; they want the proposal to be considered at the level of the Home Minister and be funded as a special project. In our view, the proposal should be looked at, and considered, in the context of the development of an effective border protection grid, which has been discussed in more detail later.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">3.10.4</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> In addition to the State Police, there is also a Home Guard Organisation in Mizoram, as in all other states, with a sanctioned strength of 1260, including 154 regular posts. The Home Guards are presently being used mainly for guarding security and other important installations/establishments in various districts. Keeping in view the long international borders in Mizoram, and the difficulties in border protection, including surveillance and quick reaction, etc., on account of difficult terrain conditions, the State Government has proposed the rising of a separate Home Guards Battalion as a Border Wing of the organisation, comprising 75 full time and 714 part time functional posts (combatants), involving an annual expenditure of around Rs.9 crore. It has been suggested that, with the rising of such a Battalion, the strength of the BOPs of the Border Guarding Forces could be enhanced with added elements from the proposed Border Wing of the Home Guards, which could help in moreeffective patrolling and, most importantly, providing the vital element of local knowledge with reference to the terrain, possible infiltration route, identification of infiltrators/anti-national elements, etc. In addition, this will also provide an employment avenue for the youth in border areas. The possible deployment pattern, which includes deployment of one company in each of the border district, has also been indicated. We are of the considered opinion that this proposal merits serious consideration, and further details of deployment, use, etc., could be worked out jointly by the State Police, Home Guards Organisation and the BSF.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">3.10.5</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> An important aspect in relation to the above proposal would pertain to funding. During discussions with the State Government it was mentioned that, due to the fact of the State being largely peaceful, the Central Government is not providing any funds under the head of Security Related Expenditure (SRE) any longer. It may be observed, in this context, that the proposal to raise a Border Home Guards Battalion could be seen as another form of employment/deployment of SPOs for purposes of border protection. Keeping this in view, as also the fact that the mandate of the High Level Empowered Committee (HLEC) of the State Police and other organisations, the issue of funding the proposal should not present any significant problems and difficulties.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">If necessary, assistance could be provided to the State Government for minimum critically necessary infrastructure for their BOPs and enhancement of deployment at such locations.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Assistance should be provided to the State Government with reference to CCTNS, and linkages with BSF should be built into such a network, to facilitate inter-agency intelligence and operational coordination with reference to border protection.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The proposal of the State Government for raising a Battalion of Border Home Guard should be urgently considered for approval, and this should be integrated into the proposed Border Protection Grid.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">3.12.2</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Firstly, there are the aspects of connectivity and linkage with areas in the hinterland, and vital facilities related to a wider area level/religion infrastructure. These essentially include road connectivity with the main highways, which we have discussed earlier, and availability of electricity and telecom connectivity, which would be dependent upon a wider power/cable grids. The State Government needs to look at all these areas in a focused manner. Particular attention, is required on connectivity, both terrestrial and mobile telephony. As far a roads are concerned, at one level, there is need to look at the arrangements for the maintenance of the National and State Highways &ndash; it is understood that the responsibility for the formal is also now with the State Government; and, at another, there is need focussed attention on developing connectivity with the border villages and habitations under the PMGSY within a time-bound action plan. As far as telecom links are connected, a special plan for establishing mobile towers in the presently unconnected areas should be considered.</span></span></span></span></p>

We feel that there is need to conduct surveys and prepare sector specific plans with respect of the border Blocks, Funding for such plans could be provided through the BADP, the budget of the CADC and the Social Infrastructure Fund of the Ministry of DONER.</span></span></span></span></p>
