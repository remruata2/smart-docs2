Sir,

 With reference to your letter No. and subject cited above, I have to state that few elements of Bru insurgents operating under the umbrella of National Liberation Front of Tripura(NLFT) was formerly known as Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram(BNDLFM). In the beginning of this year 2014, the volunteers of aforesaid BNDLFM called themselves as Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram(BDFM). Their activities are closely monitored through human intelligence as well as through technical surveillance.

 Besides, Hmar People's Convention(Democratic) (HPC(D)) is a Manipur based insurgent group operating along Mizoram-Manipur border including adjoining villages on both sides of the two States, the said HPC(D) has signed Suspension of Operation(SoO) with Government of Manipur since 2008 which was reviewed and extended every after one year. Their activities are closely monitored through human intelligence as well as through technical surveillance.

 This is for your kind information and further necessary action please.
