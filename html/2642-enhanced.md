Ref :- No.PHQ/AIGP(Mod)/NPM/2021/149 Dt.06.09.2021.

Sir,

  With reference to the subject and letter no. mentioned above, this is to state that Sl.No.26, 27 and 30 of the project, under National Police Mission have not been taken up by CID(SB) as they are beyond the capabilities of the Unit. It may be mentioned that Project No.26 is more concerned with Traffic Branch/DEF as it aims to provide prompt Medical aid and treatment to road accident victims. Similarly, CID(SB) is not capable of establishing Social Media Labs, although social medias are being monitored by staffs of CID(SB) for any reliable and important intelligence input. Lastly, CID(SB) has no technical expertise or resources to develop a Mobile App.

 Submitted for kind information and necessary action, please.

Yours faithfully,

(B.LALDINGNGHETA) Addl.SP

For Sr. Superintendent of Police
