Both the factions claimed to be the genuine BLFM outfit and competed each other to get more members by launching an extensive fresh recruitment drive. Their main slogan and bait to get more recruits is that they are surrendering to the GOM in the near future and surrender benefits to the tune of Rs. 90,000/- per head is at hand. This slogan opened pandora&rsquo;s box and almost every household in the refugee camp were lured to send one of the family members to get enrolled in the outfit.
