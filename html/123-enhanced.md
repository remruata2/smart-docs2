Polling process went off smoothly barring few instances of EVM malfunctions which were promptly replaced. There have also been complaints with regard to misprint of the MNF party symbol, i.e. ‘Star’ which was wrongly printed as ‘Sun’ in Vanglaini Daily Newspaper issued on 11.4.2019. The MNF party had sharply reacted to this alleging that the error was deliberate with ulterior motive and subsequently lodged a complaint to the CEO, Mizoram. Consequent to the complaint submitted by MNF party, the CEO has issued a Show Cause Notice to the Independent candidate supported by INC and ZPM, Pu Lalnghinglova Hmar, who also happened to be the Jt. Editor of Vanglaini Daily Newspaper. In this connection, FIR was submitted by Pu Vanlalngaihsaka, Returning Officer, 1-Mizoram (ST) PC and DC, Aizawl at Aizawl PS (GDE No.14 @ 3:15 p.m of 11.4.2019) and case is likely to be registered after taking cognizance from competent Court.

 INC and ZPM also submitted a complaint to the CEO, Mizoram on 11.4.2019 stating that errors occurred in Lunglei District in which names of candidates at Sl.No.4 &amp; 5, i.e. Lalhriatrenga Chhangte and Lalnghinglova Hmar respectively, both independent candidates had been interchanged and thereby causing confusion for elderly voters in particular.
