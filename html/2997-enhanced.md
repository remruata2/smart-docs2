****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/304

Dated: 7th May, 2019.

With reference to our Special Report No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/298 Dt.06.05.2019, information has been received that the “Site Banner“ put up by MZP at Zophai yesterday had disappeared today, apparently removed by unknown person/persons. The MZP were understood to have resented this indicating their intention to re-visit Zophai in the near future. Input received indicated that there is a likelihood of the MZP deliberately trying to blame the Bengali settlers on Assam side of being responsible for removing their “Site Banner“ even though they also suspect that it was done by the NGOs of Bairabi. The MZP General Hqrs. has instructed Bairabi Sub-Hqrs to first submit an FIR in this regard. A meeting will be held soon to decide their course of action in this regard.
