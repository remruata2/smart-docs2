In Silchar with the help of Local Auto Driver (name not known) he made a fake Voter ID in the name of Muktab Uddin Mazarbhuya / No.LSY2439181 with a simple process by getting his photo pasted on Muktab Uddin Mazarbhuiya&rsquo;s voter ID card.

It has been revealed that Lalengzauva gave Rs. 20,000/- to Haukhenkham. After delivering the consignment for the second time, Haukhenkham had told Lalengzauva that he did not want to interfere in the bussiness anymore. Lalengzauva accordingly had intimated the same to Shomsul. However, Shomsul Alam requested him to once again help him and promised to purchased a Bolero if they could bring the third consignment for him. On 30.05.2019 @&nbsp; 12 : 05 p.m. Shomsul Alam sent a mobile number (9774085763) followed by a voice message @ 12 : 06 p.m. &nbsp;instructing Lalengzauva to make a call at the number which Lalengzauva did, and giving further instruction to co-accd Haukhenkham, transaction of the contraband was carried out accordingly at Zokhawthar the same night.
