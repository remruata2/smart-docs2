****Subject: Suspicion against Pu J.Lalchhawna, Chief Controller of Mizoland Finance Service.****

**Ref: No.D.32020/12/2011-HM dt.27.9.2011.**

**Sir,**

****With reference to the above, I am submitting the enquiry report in respect of J.Lalchhawna, Chief Controller of Mizoland Finance Service and Liannothanga of Chhinga Veng as under.****

**J. Lalchhawna: He is the proprietor of Mizoland Finance Service and reportedly collected money amounting to Rs.300 lakhs from the public. He once intended to smuggle red sanderwood but his contact/agent had given him fake ones and hence gone bankrupt. Due to that failure, he is presently unable to give back the money collected from the public/customers who in turn pushed him hard for repayment. Though he claimed not to have indulged in arms smuggling, his bankruptcy might have compelled him in doing such business and the same cannot be ruled out. His movement is kept under close surveillance.**

****Liannothanga: Liannothanga@Panova is residing in Chhinga Veng since a long period of time. He firstly run business by making different shops such as Photo Studio, Garments Shop. However, due to some problem he closed his shops and sold off his plot of land located at Zuangtui to start a bigger business i.e. smuggling of red sanderwood. For this he had a non-Mizo partner(name unknown) and handed over cash Rs.250 lakhs to him but unfortunately his partner ran away without giving back his money nor red sanderwood.****

**Though Liannothanga had involved in arms smuggling activities in the past, presently he is very weak due to sickness and is unlikely to involve in illegal smuggling. His activity/movement is kept under close surveillance.**

****Yours faithfully,****
