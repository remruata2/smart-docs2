**INFLUX OF REFUGEES IN MIZORAM**

Following the military takeover in Myanmar on 1st February, 2021 and the resultant clashes between the Myanmar Army and the Resistance Forces of Myanmar, a considerable number of refugees, particularly from the Chin community, have sought asylum and taken shelter in Mizoram since the coup. Some of the larger influxes of Myanmar Nationals into Mizoram are as under:

1. The alleged inhumane way of handling the protesters by the new military government led to influx of a few thousand Myanmar Nationals in the early part of the military regime.

1. An intense arm fight between CDF and Myanmar Army at Lungler Village on 09.09.2021 and the retaliation by Myanmar Army by Airstrikes led to a large-scale influx of more than 1500 Myanmar Nationals into Mizoram’s Champhai and Hnahthial District.

1. The arm attack of Myanmar Army at Rikhawdar camp on 28.01.2023 by PDF led to huge influx of Myanmar Nationals as many as more than 2400 into Champhai District of Mizoram.

1. The arm clash between Arakan Army and Myanmar Army near Varang village, Myanmar in between 28.08.2022 and 30.08.2022 and in between 28.01.2023 and 04.02.2023 led to an influx of a large number of Myanmar Nations into Lawngtlai District of Mizoram.

1. The military operation against the Myanmar Army by the combined resistance force on 12.11.2023 at Khawmawi and Rihkhawdar, Myanmar and the subsequent clashes between the Myanmar Army and the resistance force in several parts of Chin State of Myanmar led to an influx of huge number of Myanmar Nationals as many as more than 6500 into Mizoram. However, many of the Myanmar Nationals who had seek refuge inside Mizoram in the recent incidents went back to their villages as the resistance forces had captured the Myanmar Army post in most places.

1. Latest report stated that a number of Myanmar Nationals seeking refuge in Mizoram due to the order of compulsory joining of the Myanmar Army by the State Administrative Council (Myanmar Army) have significantly increased recently. It is reported that as many as 763 (seven hundred sixty three) Myanmar Nationals had fled Myanmar and entered Zokhawthar in the hope of escaping the order as of 18.03.2024. These Myanmar Nationals are mainly from Tahan, Pingkung and Letpanchaung of Myanmar and stayed with their friends and families living in the 5 (five) refugee camps at Zokhawthar. The numbers of these Myanmar Nationals trying to escape compulsory joining of the Myanmar Army and entered Mizoram are likely to increase in the coming days.

The district-wise number of Myanmar Nationals seeking shelter in Mizoram as per state government records as on 28.03.2024, is as follows:

1.  Aizawl:  3,306

2. Lunglei:  2,009

3. Champhai: 12,484

4. Lawngtlai: 5,954

5. Siaha:  5,916

6. Hnahthial: 1,101

7. Serchhip:  509

8. Kolasib:  138

9. Saitual:  195

10. Khawzawl: 125

11. Mamit:  356 

**TOTAL: 32,093**

**Uniform Personnel of Myanmar surrendering to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles:**

 Due to the intense military operations conducted by the combined resistance forces of Myanmar against Myanmar Army in several places of Chin State, Myanmar, many Myanmar Army and Police personnel posted and camped near the IMB surrendered themselves to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles at different places. These personnel of Myanmar were evacuated to safety for their return into Myanmar. The lack of proper Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on the issue of surrendering of Myanmar Army personnel or government servant needed a review to devise a strategy on the matter. Uniform personnel of Myanmar who surrendered to Mizoram Police/Assam Rifles:

**Date of surrender No. of personnel Place of surrender**

13.11.2023  39 Army personnel Zokhawthar PS

14.11.2023  06 Army personnel Zokhawthar PS

16.11.2023  29 Army personnel Saikhumphai, Champhai.

28.11.2023  30 Army personnel Laki, Siaha.

29.12.2023  151 Army personnel AR Post Tuisentlang, Lawngtlai.

06.01.2024  104 Army personnel AR Post Lungpuk, Siaha.

17.01.2024 276 Army personnel AR Post Parva, Lawngtlai.

**Total 635 personnel**

**Challenges in managing the refugees:**

1. The Myanmar nationals are sheltered in various districts of Mizoram and many of them are accommodated in their relative’s houses and some are staying in their own rented houses and makeshift camps set up by local NGOs. The whereabouts of these refugees could not be ascertained as there is no proper record of their movement. It has been reported that some of the refugees are acquiring moveable and immovable properties in their name and using the name of their relatives.

1. Influx of Myanmar refugees in large numbers adversely impacted their relatives who shelter them and the State Government socio-economically. The increase in the number of thefts and robberies could also be attributed to the large number of unemployed refugees. The possibility of Law and Order due to internal feuds between the permanent resident of Mizoram and the refugees could not be ruled out on issues like illegal possession of birth certificate or other documents to these refugees.

1. An instruction has been issued by Ministry of Home Affairs (Foreigners Division) for obtaining the biometric data of these Myanmar Nationals by the end of September 2023. However, the Council of Ministers in its meeting held on 27th September 2023 decided not to proceed with collection of Biometric and Biographic preparation of Myanmar refugees and the decision of the newly formed government is awaited in this regard.

**B. 2) Issue of Uniform Personnel of Myanmar surrendering to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles:**

Due to the recent intense military operations conducted by the combined resistance forces of Myanmar against Myanmar Army in several places of Chin State, Myanmar, many Myanmar Army and Police personnel posted and camped near the IMB surrendered themselves to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles at different places. These personnel of Myanmar were evacuated to safety for their return into Myanmar. The lack of proper Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on the issue of surrendering of Myanmar Army personnel or government servant needed a review to devise a strategy on the matter. Uniform personnel of Myanmar who surrendered to Mizoram Police/Assam Rifles:

**Date of surrender No. of personnel Place of surrender**

08.12.2023   06 Police personnel Kakichhuah, Lawngtlai

**Total 110 personnel**

1. **MOVEMENT OF CONTRABAND ITEMS:**

**Smugglers and traffickers of contraband items took advantage of the long stretch of unfenced porous international border along the Indo-Myanmar Border in trafficking illegal items across the border. Apart from Mizoram Police, the Border Guarding Force had seized large consignments of Narcotic drugs at regular intervals. A brief summary of the seizures of Arms and Ammunitions and Explosive Substances is as under: ******

1. **Drugs:**The total value of seized narcotic drugs in the year 2021 is Rs. 2474 Lakhs and its increases to Rs. 4342.2 Lakhs in 2022 which is an increase of 75% and yet increases to a little over Rs. 1,84,67 Lakhs in 2023 (upto November) which is another increase of 325%. The number of foreigners arrested in connection with ND&amp;PS Act cases increases from 12 (twelve) persons in 2021 to 50 (fifty) foreigners in 2022 and rises to 52 (fifty) foreigners in 2023.
2. **Arms Ammunition and Explosives:**The number of cases registered in the year 2021 under Explosive Substances Act is 03 (three) in which no foreigners were arrested while the number of foreigners arrested in 2022 where 12 (twelve) cases were registered increases to 04 (four) and in 2023 where 09 (nine) cases were registered the number of arrested foreigners increases to 08 Myanmar nationals. The number of cases registered under Arms Act in 2021 is 18 (eighteen) in which 07 (seven) foreigners were arrested, 28 (twenty) cases were registered in 2022 in which 09 (nine) foreigners were arrested while 27 (twenty seven) cases were registered in 2023 (Upto November) where 04 (four) foreigners were arrested.****

Increase of smuggling of narcotic drugs in Mizoram with a rise in seizure of narcotic drugs and other contrabands items can be attributed to the consequences of the civil war in Myanmar and internal conflict in Manipur and the subsequent influxes of refugees from Myanmar and displaced persons from Manipur. A few cases had also been registered against Myanmar nationals who are obtaining unauthorized Aadhaar card, PAN card, vehicle registration card, voters’ identity card etc. illegally.

The interrogation of the accused persons in the cases of the above seized arms, ammunitions and explosives substances revealed that these contrabands were meant for the involved conflict groups of Myanmar and Manipur. Inputs strongly suggested that the sale proceeds of these seized narcotic drugs were mostly meant to financially support these groups.

1. **MYANMAR INSURGENT GROUPS HOLDING MEETINGS AT AIZAWL:**

A three days meeting on Future Chinland Constitution Planning was held in between 07.09.2023 to 09.09.2023 at Central YMA Hall, Aizawl. The meeting was attended by 108 delegates including MPs, MLAs, Township Leaders of Chin State, Myanmar and representatives of Chinland Defence Force (CDF). The meeting resolved to form Chinland Council and appoint a 31 member drafting committee to finalize the Draft Constitution (Final Draft). The complacency in allowing the said meeting of insurgent groups of Myanmar in Aizawl could post a threat to the security of the state as well as the country which is highlighted under:

1. It could adversely affect the ties between India and Myanmar and hampers the ongoing projects of India’s Act East Policy like the Kaladan Multi Transport Transit Project (KMTTP) and the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway.
2. Providing a safe haven for these insurgents groups may lead to gathering of arms and ammunition in the state or using the state as a safe route for transporting smuggled narcotic drugs or other contraband items by such groups to finance the military operation of the groups in Myanmar.
3. Due to the close ethnic ties between the people of Mizoram with these insurgent groups and the influxes of Myanmar Nationals in Mizoram, the possibility of recruitment, illegal collection of fund from the locals or refugees which could impact the security of the people of Mizoram could not be ruled out.
4. The internal feud between the different factions of these insurgent groups of Myanmar if carried forward inside the state will be catastrophic.
