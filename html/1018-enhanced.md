****INTERNAL SECURITY WITH FOCUS ON INTELLIGENCE SHARING AND CO-ORDINATION FOR COMBATING TERRORISM/INSURGENCY ETC. IN MIZORAM****

****I.****Overview of State Security********

The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful.

 Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (The insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decades armed insurgency of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where around 104 Cadres and 12 Council Members of HPC(D) came to over ground at the ceremony.

 As for the North-Western region, the Bru insurgency has been contained to a great extend so much so that this insurgent Group has become more or less a group of Bandits without any definite demand or objectives.

However, Mizoram is having approximately 404 kms. and 318 kms. porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively. Assam Rifles manned the Indo-Myanmar border in the East and South while BSF manned the Western border with limited man-power which leaves many pockets vulnerable to infiltration. The porous international borders served as a possible route for IGs to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, etc across the borders of Mizoram.

**II. Intelligence sharing and co-ordination for combating terrorism/insurgency :**

A robust mechanism for intelligence sharing among the various States and Central agencies is in place in the country. The coordination mechanism for intelligence sharing at state–level that presently exist in Mizoram is highlighted as under:

**(a) Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC):**

Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC) was set up in Mizoram Police during May, 2011. It is one of the Centres amongst various Intelligence Agencies under Ministry of Home Affairs for effective sharing of intelligence input/report with other Central and State Agencies. Regular SMAC meetings of Nodal Officers of the State police, security forces, paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies deployed within the State of Mizoram are being conducted regularly at SIB Hqrs., Aizawl. During such meetings, intelligence inputs are shared and discussed with responders/State Police and often Law Enforcement Agencies for necessary follow up action.

**Suggestion to improve the System of SMAC in Mizoram:** 

Real time sharing of intelligence inputs through Threat Management System (TMS) with other intelligence agencies is hampered due to frequent disruption of connectivity (intranet) of the system. It is therefore suggested that suitable measures may be taken to plug such loophole.

**(b) Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA) Coordination/ Directional Meeting:**

Assam Rifle and Border Security Force (BSF) have regularly conducted LIA Coordination Meeting in Aizawl. LIA Directional Meeting is also regularly conducted by BSF in Silchar, Assam. During such meetings, intelligence inputs are shared and discussed with responders/State Police and often Law Enforcement Agencies for necessary follow up action. The LIA Coordination meeting is held under the chairmanship of DIG, 23rd Assam Rifle if LIA is conducted by Assam Rifle and DIG, Sector HQ BSF presided over the meeting if it was conducted by BSF.
