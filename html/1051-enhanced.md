******Tablighi Jamaat**__

**Tablighi Jamaat**(Urdu:ØªØ¨Ù„ÛŒØºÛŒ Ø¬Ù…Ø§Ø¹Øª‎, literally the_Proselytizing Society_), is an Islamic missionary movement that focuses on urging Muslims to return to practising their religion as it was practised during the lifetime of theIslamic prophetMuhammad, and particularly in matters of ritual, dress and personal behaviour. The organisation is estimated to have between 12 million to 80million adherents worldwide,with the majority living in South Asia, and a presence in somewhere between 180and 200 countries. It has been deemed as one of the most influential religious movements in 20th century Islam.

 Established in 1927 byMuhammad Ilyas al-KandhlawiinMewatregion of India, it began as an offshoot of the Deobandi movement, and as a response to perceived deterioration of moral values and a supposed neglect of the aspects of Islam. The movement aims for the spiritual reformation of Islam by working at the grassroots level.The teachings of Tabligh Jamaat are expressed in "Six Principles" (_Kalimah (Declaration of faith)_,_Salah (Prayer)_,_Ilm-o-zikr (Knowledge)_,_Ikraam-e-Muslim (Respect of Muslim)_,_Ikhlas-e-Niyyat (Sincerity of intention)_,_Dawat-o-Tableegh (Proselytizaton)_).

 Tablighi Jamaat denies any affiliation in politics and_fiqh_ (jurisprudence), focusing instead on the Quran and Hadith.It states that it rejects violence as a means for evangelism.

**History**

 The emergence of Tablighi Jamaat represented the intensification of individual reformation aspects of the original Deobandi movement. It was also a continuation of the broader trend of Islamic revival in India in the wake of the collapse ofMuslim political hegemonyto theMaratha Empireand the subsequent consolidation of theBritish raj.

 The emergence of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided closely with the rise of various Hindu revivalist movements such as_Shuddhi_(purification) and_Sanghatan_(consolidation) launched in the early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Christianity.

**Origin**

 The practices and teachings in the Prophet's Mosque in Medina and asabusSuffah Muhammad Ilyas, the founder of Tablighi Jamaat, wanted to create a movement that would enjoin good and forbid evil as theQurandecreed,as his teacherRasheed Ahmad Gangohidreamed of doing.The inspiration for this came during his secondpilgrimagetoMeccain 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal.He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate theMewatiMuslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.

 Muhammad Ilyas abandoned his teaching post atMadrasah Mazahir UloominSaharanpurand became a missionary for reforming Muslims (but he did not advocate preaching to non-Muslims). He relocated toNizamuddinnearDelhi, where this movement was formally launched in 1926,or 1927.When setting the guidelines for the movement, he sought inspiration from the practices adopted by Muhammad at the dawn of Islam. MuhammadIlyas put forward the slogan,Urdu:"!Ø§ï®® Ù…Ø³Ù„Ù…Ø§Ù†Ùˆ! Ù…Ø³Ù„Ù…Ø§Ù† Ø¨Ù†Ùˆ"‎, "O Muslims, become [true] Muslims!". This expressed the central focus of Tablighi Jamat: their aim to renew Muslims socially by uniting them in embracing the lifestyle of Muhammad. The movement gained a following in a relatively short period and nearly 25,000 people attended the annual conference in November 1941.

 At the time, some Muslim Indian leaders feared that Muslims were losing their religious identity and were heedless of Islamic rituals(mainly daily prayers). The movement was never given any name officially, but Ilyas used to call it_Tahrik-i Imaan_.

 TheMewatregion where TJ started aroundDelhiwas inhabited by theMeos, aRajputethnic group, some of whom had converted to Islam, and then re-converted to Hinduism when Muslim political power declined in the region, lacking the necessary acumen (according to one author, Ballard) required to resist the cultural and religious influence of majority Hindus, prior to the arrival of Tablighi Jamaa

**Expansion**

Bishwa IjtemainBangladesh

 The group began to expand its activities in 1946. The initial expansion within South Asia happened immediately after the partition of India in 1947, when the Pakistan Chapter was established in the hinterlands ofRaiwindtown nearLahore, Pakistan. The Pakistan Chapter remained the largest until Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan in 1971. Today, the largest Chapter is Bangladesh followed by the second largest in Pakistan. Within two decades of its establishment, the group reached Southwest and Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. The Tablighi Jamaat's aversion to politics, and also its lack of any direct and practical economic-political-social viewpoints, like the occupation of Palestine, helped it enter and operate in societies, especially western countries and societies where politically active religious groups faced restrictions.

****Foreign missions****

 The first foreign missions were sent to theHejaz(westernSaudi Arabia) and Britain in 1946.The United States followed and during the 1970s and 1980s the Tablighi Jamaat also established a large presence in continental Europe.In France it was introduced in the 1960s, and grew significantly in the two decades following 1970.

 In Europe Tablighi Jamaat focused on marginalised populations – "migrant workers deprived of any cultural access to European society, `lost` teens, drug addicts". It peaked in popularity and numbers in Europe between the mid-1970s and mid 1980s, and declined thereafter (in France it reportedly started to decline around 1989) as young people from Muslim families, educated in Europe, began to seek "a more intellectual framework for their faith", and moved towardSalafiIslam.In France, as of 2004, it was represented on theFrench Council of the Muslim Faith.During the first half-decade of the 21st century Tablighi Jamaat went through a major revival in France, reaching 100,000 followers by 2006. However, the United Kingdom is the current focus of the movement in Europe, primarily due to the large South Asian population that began to arrive there in the 1960s.By 2007, Tablighi Jamaat members were situated at 600 of Britain's 1,350 mosques.

 After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the movement made inroads into Central Asia. As of 2007, it was estimated that 10,000 Tablighi Jamaat members could be found inKyrgyzstan,that was largely driven by Pakistani members initially.

 Pew Research Centerestimates there are between 12 and 80million adherents, spread across more than 150 countries.By some measures this made Tablighi Jamaat the largest Muslim movement in the World. The majority of the followers of the Tablighi Jamaat live in South Asia. It is estimated that nearly 50,000 members of Tablighi Jamaat are active in the United States.

 An attempt atSalafistexpansion among the MuslimChamsin Vietnam has been halted by Vietnamese government controls, which has been of benefit to Tablighi Jamaat.

**Beliefs and objectives**

 Members of Tabligh Jamat are allowed to follow their ownfiqhas long as it does not deviate fromSunniIslam.Tablighi Jamaat defines its objective with reference to the concept of_Dawah__,_the proselytizing or preaching of Islam. Tablighi Jamaat interprets_Dawah_as_enjoining good and forbidding evil_only and defines its objective within the framework of two particular Qur'anic verses which refer to this mission.Those two verses are:

Who is better in speech than one who calls (men) toAllah, works righteousness, and says, "I am of the muslims (those who submit to Allah) "?

— _Qur'an,__sura__(chapter) 41 (__Fussilat__),__ayah__(verse) 3_

Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity.

— _Qur'an sura (chapter) 3 (__Al-i-Imran__), ayah (verse) 104_

 Tablighi Jamaat encourages everyone to fulfill the Islamic requirement of_dawah_even if the person falls short of strong religious intellect. This was different from the other Islamic movements which were mainlyulama-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote_dawah_as a mechanism of self-reform.

 Like Salafists, Tabligh seek a "separation in their daily life from the `impious` society that surrounded them". The only objective of Tabligh Jamaat, overtly stated in mostsermons, is that Muslims adopt and invite for the Islamic lifestyle, exemplified by Muhammad, in its perfection. This involves a detailedorthopraxy: "followers must dress like the Prophet, sleep as he did on the ground, on one's right side";enter bathrooms leading with the left foot, but put pants on leading with the right foot; do not use a fork when eating, instead use your index finger, middle finger and thumb; men shave their upper lips, but let their beards grow; their pants or robes should be above the ankle "because the prophet said letting clothes drag on the ground is a sign of arrogance".The movement encourages Muslims to spend time out of their daily routine in the tablighi activities so that the rest of routine could be harmonised with Tablighi lifestyle. Adherents are also encouraged to enroll in Deobandi madaaris (found around the world) to deepen their faith.

 The method adopted by Muhammad Ilyas was to organise units (called_jamaats_,Arabic:**Ø¬Ù…Ø§Ø¹Ø§ØªÙ**‎ meaning_Assembly_) of at least ten persons and send them to various villages or neighborhoods to preach. These outings,_Dawah_tours (see below), are now organised by TJ leaders.In these tours, emphasis is laid on "Ahadithabout virtues of action" (imitating Muhammad). In the ahadith (reported sayings of Muhammad) of_fazail_(virtues) these has been called_Eemaan_(faith) and_Ihtisab_(for the sake of Allah) and TJ believes this is the most vital deriving force for reward in_akhirah_(afterlife). TJ founder Ilyas preached that knowledge of virtues and_A'amalu-Saliha_(Good Deeds and Actions) takes precedence over the knowledge of_Masa'il_(jurisprudence). Knowing jurisprudence detail (Fara'id (mandates) and Sunan (traditions) of Salat) is useful only if a person is ready to perform rituals such as offeringSalat. They insist that the best way of learning is teaching and encouraging others, with the books prescribed by Tabligi Jamaat Movement in the light of Quran and Hadith stories of Prophets,_Sahaba_(Companions of Prophet) and_Awlia__Allah_("Friends of Allah").Even though there are publications associated with the movement, particularly byZakariya Kandahalwi, the emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication.A collection of books, usually referred as_Tablighi Nisaab_(Tablighi Curriculum), is recommended by Tabligh Jamaat elders for general reading. This set includes four books namely (_Hayatus Sahabah_,_Fazail-e-Amaal_,_Fazail-e-Sadqaat_and_Muntakhab Ahadith_).

 Tablighi ethic discourages social engagement or participation with some non-orthodox customary and ceremonial rituals which are usually extravagantly followed in South Asia. For example, marriages are performed en masse at annual congregations and other similar mass meetings, so that the costly celebrations common in South Asia are avoided.

 In its early days and in South Asia, the Tabligh movement aimed to return to orthodoxy and "purify" the Muslim religio-cultural identity of heterodox or "borderline" Muslims who still practised customs and religious rites connected with Hinduism. Especially to counteract the efforts of Hindu proselytising movements who targeted these often recently converts from Hinduism.Unlike common proselytising movements, has TJ mostly focused on making Muslims 'better and purer' and ideally "religiously perfect", rather than preaching to the non-Muslims. This is because (it believes) dawah to non-Muslims will only be effective (or will be much more effective) when a Muslim reaches "perfection".

****Six Attributes (SifÄt)****

 TJ visits a village or neighborhood, invites the local Muslims to assemble in the mosque and present their message in the form of Six Attributes.These six Attributes were derived from the lives of the companions of Muhammad. It is stated in one narration, "My Sahabah (companions) are like [guiding] stars, whosoever follows [any] one of them will be guided."[(Sahih Muslim 6466; 207-(2531) Darussalam ed.), Used in notable Fiqh books for 'judging' purpose]. Muslim's believe, they were the best human beings after Muhammad .Muhammad Ilyas just articulated six demands in the form of Six SifÄt which are quintessential to Tablighi Jamaat's teachings. Its basically a discussion about 6 special Attributes that one have to achieve, which will just make it Easy to follow the entireDÄ«n. According to them, the objectives are:

1. **Kalimah**/_Ê¾Ä«mÄn_[believe with conviction]: 'lÄ ilÄha illÄ -llÄh (There is) No god but Allah, muá¸¥ammadur rasÅ«lu -llÄh; is a sacred pledge of man with GOD (believe with conviction &amp; adopt thelifestyle) which should transform one'sCertainty, Lifestyle &amp; Affection [from Creation to Creator; Other's to Sunnah &amp; Worldly to Afterlife].
2. **Namaz**/_Salah_[Performing the prescribed prayers]: Achieve sahaba standard salah &amp; certainty so that one can get spiritual elevation, piety and a life free from the ills of the material world .
3. **Ilm****with****Zikr**[Knowledge with Remembrance]: One have to achieve enough wisdom so that (A) able to differentiate between what is permissible-impermissible, purity-impurity, legitimacy-illegitimacy in all aspects of his/her life (B) Know that, at any given moment, in one's 24-hour existence, what GOD wants of him/ her.| Ilm, Dhikr are interconnected &amp; to get benefit one have to achieve them simultaneously. At each moment in one's worldly existence he/she have to achieve, a conscious awareness, nearness, a ta’aluq [relationship] andMa'rifa[knowledge] of GOD.
4. **Ikram al-Muslim**[Honoring Muslims]: Treat fellow humans with honor and deference. with all the rest of the Ummah (and by extension, all of creation) – be based on love, compassion, honor, generosity and respect. Instead of demanding them, one should not only forgo his/her rights, but become deeply concerned with giving others at least their due (rights stipulated by the Sacred Law).
5. **Sahih****Niyyah**/_IkhlÄá¹£_[Only for GOD]: Sincerity of Intention – Reforming one's life in supplication to GOD by performing every human action (especially ibadah &amp;Muamalat) for the sake of GOD and toward the goal of self-transformation".
6. **Dawah & Tabligh**/ Tabligh-i-waqt [Invitation and Conveyance]: Inviting and Preaching – The sparing of time to live a life based on faith and learning its virtues, following in the footsteps of Muhammad, and taking His message door to door for the sake of faith, so that (A) All of humanity (Including Oneself) until the Day Reckoning embodies the first five of the Six Attributes &amp; (B) All of humanity attains salvation, saved from

**Organisation**

 Kakrail Mosque,Dhaka. The Tablighi Jamaat movement inBangladeshis mostly based here.

 Tablighi Jamaat follows an informal organisational structure and keeps an introvert institutional profile. It has been described as "a free-floating religious movement with minimal dependence on hierarchy, leadership positions, and decision-making procedures."It keeps its distance from mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly to avoid the disputes which would accompany these endorsements.As an organisation, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations and is not funded by anyone, in fact members have to bear their own expenditures. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as_Tablighi Nisaab_[Tablighi Curriculum]). The emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication.

 The organisation's activities are coordinated through centres and headquarters called_Markaz_. Tablighi Jamaat is maintained from its international headquarters, called_Nizamuddin Markaz_, in the Nizamuddin West district ofSouth Delhi, India, from where it originally started .It also has country headquarters in over 200 countries to co-ordinate its activities. These headquarters organise volunteer, self-funding people in groups (called_jamaats_), averaging ten to twelve people, for reminding Muslims to remain steadfast on path of Allah.These_jamaats_and preaching missions are self funded by their respective members.

 Amarat-Ameeris title of supervisor(doyen) in the Tabligh Jamaat and the attribute largely sought is the quality of faith, rather than the worldly rank.The ameer of Tabligh Jamaat is appointed for life by a central consultative council (_shura_) and elders of the Tabligh Jamaat. The first_ameer_wasMaulana (cleric) Muhammad Ilyas Kandhalawi, later succeeded by his sonMaulana (cleric) Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawiand then byMaulana (cleric) Inaam ul Hasan. During sometime in 1992, 3 years before the time of his demise, Maulana (cleric) Inaamul Hasan, formed a 10-member Shura (committee) to appoint an ameer. This 10 member shura committee consisted of Maulana Saeed Ahmed Khan Sb, Mufti Zainul Abideen, Maulana Umar sb palanpuri, Maulana Izhar ul Hasan, Maulana Zubair ul hasan, Miyaji Mehraab sb, Haji Abdul Wahab Sb, Haji engineer Abdul Muqeet sb, Haji Afzal sb andMuhammad Saad Kandhlawi.In 1995, after the demise of Maulana Inaamul Hasan sb, this shura consulted in Markaz Nizamuddin for the selection of Ameer, but instead of one ameer entire shura agreed upon that there will be no ameer and work will progress with shura by rotation of Faisals.

 After the demise of Hazratji's Maulana Inamul Hasan Sb Shura Members,14 Members of Shura was added by the Senior Ulama &amp; Eldes of Tabligh Jamat in front of more that 120 countries responsible zimmedars.

****Activities and traditions****

 The activism of Tablighi Jamaat can be characterised by the last of the Six Principles. This principle,_Tafrigh-i-Waqt_(English: sparing of time) justifies the withdrawal from World, though temporarily, for travelling. Travel has been adopted as the most effective method of personal reform and has become an emblematic feature of organisation. They describe the purpose of this retreat as to patch the damages caused by the worldly indulgence and occasionally use the dry-dock parable to explain this.

 These individual_jamaats_, each led by an_ameer_, are sent from each markaz across the city or country to remind people to persist on the path of God. The duration of the work depends on the discretion of each_jamaat_. A trip can take an evening, a couple of days or a prolonged duration.

****KhurÅ«j (proselytising tour)****

 Largest Islamic movement, Tabligh Jamaat encourages its followers to follow the pattern of spending "ten nights a month (Ashra),120continuous days a year (Teen Chilla), and ultimately 150days (5 Maah- Beroon) in tabligh missions". During the course of these tours, members are generally seen dressed in simple, white, loose-clothing, carrying sleeping bags on their backs.These members use mosques as their base during this travel but particular mosques, due to more frequent tablighiyat activities, have come to be specifically associated with this organisation. These mosques generally hold the periodic, smaller scale convocations for neighbourhood members.

 During their stay in mosques, these_jamaats_conduct a daily_gasht_, which involves visiting local neighbourhoods, preferably with the help of a guide. They invite people to attend the_Maghrib_prayer at their mosque and those who attend are delivered a sermon after the prayers, which essentially outlines the Six Principles. They urge the attendees to spend time in tabligh for self reformation and the propagation of Islam. Also the regular activities like eating, sleeping etc. are also carried out in the mosques.

 Generally, the assumed role of these_jamaat_members cycle in a way that they may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is generally referred to as_khidmat_which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements.The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's_mashwara_. The markaz keeps records of each_jamaat_and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques. Mosques are used to assist the tablighi activities of individual_jamaats_that voluntarily undertake preaching missions.Members of a_jamaat_, ideally, pay expenses themselves so as to avoid financial dependence on anyone.

**Ijtema****(annual gathering)**

_Bishwa Ijtema_(World Gathering) of Muslims at Tongi, Bangladesh

 An annual gathering of followers, called_ijtema_, is summoned at headquarters of the respective countries. A typical_ijtema_continues for three days and ends with an exceptionally long prayer. These gatherings are considered moments of intense blessings by Tabligh Jamaat members and are known to attract members in excess of 2million in some countries. The oldest ijtema of the World started in Bhopal, capital city of Madhya Pradesh, India. It attracts people from all over World. Almost 2 million people gather for this annual gathering. The largest of such annual gatherings is held in Bangladesh. The Bengali gathering, called_Bishwa Ijtema_(World Gathering), converges followers from around the World inTonginearDhaka, Bangladesh, with an attendance exceeding 3million people. In 2018 there was an ijtema in Aurangabad in India which changed the whole scenario of tablighi with minimum attendance of 4 million people gather from around the world under the patronage of Maulana saad khandalwi ameer tablighi jamaat of nizamuddin markaz. The second largest Tabligh Jamaat gathering takes place inRaiwind, Pakistan which was attended by approximately 1.5million people in 2004.In 2011 Pakistan divided the Ijtema into two parts and total 1 million people attended each of the two Ijtema

****Role of women****

 In TJ, women are encouraged to stay home, and to choose a life of "segregation between female and male". However they also engage in proselytizing activies, discussing among themselves in small groups the basics of Tabligh and traveling with their husbands (or another_mahram_) on proselytizing trips.Tabligh inculcates in them that dawah is also important alongside taking care of their spouses or taking care of their children.

 According to a 1996 study by Barbara Metcalf,the Tablighi Jamaat has encouraged to participate since the beginning of the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first_jamaat_of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.Accompanied by a close male relative, (_mahram_, Ù…Ø­Ø±Ù…), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands._Jamaats_of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.

 In many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of_da'wa_tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.[

**Controversies**

Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh,Montasik,Aceh Besar,Aceh

**Criticism**Due to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe completehijabfor which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women "strictly subservient and second string".

 Tablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from theBarelvimovement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on_da'wa_tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.

 Many critics, especially those fromHizb ut-TahrirandJamaat-e-Islami, criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of anIslamic constitution in Pakistan(1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969–1971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), andNizam-e-Mustafa Movement(1977). The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments ofKhan Ayub (1960s) andIndira Gandhi(1975–77), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.

 The difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.

 TJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association withSufis.Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz, the former grand mufti of Saudi Arabia is reported to have said that "Jama'atul-Tableegh ... have many deviations. They have some aspects ofbid‘ahandshirk, so it is not permissible to go with them," Another Salafi cleric, Falih Ibn Nafi Al-Harbi, has reportedly complained that TJ "are the originator of fictitious tales and baseless stories and people ofbid‘ah."The elders of Tablighi Jamaat are of the view that there are different schools of thought in Islam (like other religions), so emphasis on differences rather than unity will segregate (disamalgamate) and weaken the Ummah.

****Extremism****

 The Tablighi Jamaat has been accused of extremism and terrorism. Tablighi Jamaat leaders have denied any such links. The Tablighi Jamaat generally avoids political activities and debates, and instead focuses on religion only.The Jamaat does admit that it attracts all sorts of individuals and doesn't control its membership.

 Tablighi jamaat is oftenly very intolerable of the Muslims who don't fit their version of Islam. The movement has also been linked withTalibanmovement. The fact based account is presented in the book "Faith based violence and Deobandi militancy in Pakistan" by Jawad Syed, Edwina Pio and Tahir Kamran.

 Law enforcement officials says that Tablighi Jamaat's presence all around the world and its apolitical stance have been exploited by militant groups.Philip Haneydescribed Tablighi Jamaat as a "trans-national Islamist network",and assistantFBIDirector Michael Heimbach saidal Qaedahad used them for recruiting.However, Tablighi Jamaat itself has not been accused of terrorism US officials.Leaders of the Tablighi Jamaat have denouncedAl-Qaeda.According to Alex Alexiev, "perhaps 80% percent of the Islamist extremists have come from Tablighi ranks, prompting French intelligence officers to call Tablighi Jamaat the 'antechamber of fundamentalism.'"

 Tablighi members who have been charged with terrorism include:Zacarias Moussaoui(charged in the United States in the 11 September attacks),Hervé Djamel Loiseau(French citizen found in Afghanistan), andDjamel Beghal(Algerian-born French citizen andAl Qaedamember who was convicted of plotting to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Paris), Syed Rizwan Farook.In a foiled January 2008 bombing plot in Barcelona, Spain, "some media reports" stated that a Muslim leader in the city stated that the fourteen suspects arrested by police in a series of raids (where bomb-making materials were seized) were members of the Tablighi Jamaat. Other terrorist plots and attacks on civilians that members of Tablighi Jamaat have been connected with include thePortland Seven, theLackawanna Six, the2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, the7/7 London bombings, the2007 London car bombs, and2007 Glasgow International Airport attack.

TheAmerican Foreign Policy Council's report on Tablighi Jamaat states:

 The available data today indicates that TJ, at least in the preponderance of locations around the World where it is found, can be considered_ipso facto_a passive supporter of_jihadist_groups via its reinforcement of strict Islamic norms, intolerance of other religious traditions and unwavering commitment to Islamizing the entire planet. . . However, its eschewal of politics (at least publicly) has enabled TJ, in most venues, to escape suppression by wary government organs.

According to Marc Gaborieau, its philosophy and transnational goals include the "planned conquest of the World".

Many outside observers have described the group as "apolitical" at least in part because it avoids media and government notice, operates largely in secrecy, and has missionaries that lead austere lifestyles with principled stands against social ills. Three western experts on Islam, for example, have described it as a:

Peaceful and apolitical preaching-to-the-people movement -Graham E. Fuller, a former CIA official and an expert on Islam, (author of_The Future of Political Islam_)

Completely apolitical and law abiding - Olivier Roy, a prominent authority on Islam at theFrench National Centre for Scientific Research

A political, quietist movement of internal grassroots missionary renewal (While comparing its activities to theAlcoholics Anonymousfor the efforts to reshape individual lives)- Barbara D. Metcalf,University of Michigan

Another describes it as having an "apolitical stance" which has helped it to penetrate and operate without hindrance in Muslim and non-Muslim societies where politically activist Islamic groups face severe restrictions.—Mumtaz Ahmad

 However, Tablighi Jamaat members have been involved in politics in Pakistan, and in the West, a number of young men have passed through the group on their way to an extreme, militant interpretation of the religion.

 In Pakistan, prime ministerNawaz Sharif(whose father was a prominent Tablighi member and financier) helped Tablighi members take prominent political positions. For example, in 1998, Muhammad Rafique Tarar, a Tablighi sympathiser, took the ceremonial presidency while, in 1990, Lt. Gen. Javed Nasir assumed the powerful director-generalship of theInter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan's chief intelligence agency. In 1995, afterBenazir Bhutto, who was less sympathetic to Islamist causes, returned to the premiership, the Pakistani army thwarted a coup attempt by several dozen high-ranking military officers and civilians, some of whom were members of the Tablighi Jamaat and some of whom also held membership inHarkat-ul-Mujahideen, a U.S. State Department-defined terrorist organisation. In January 2016, in what was "probably the first time that any restriction has been placed on Tableeghi Jamaat" in Pakistan, thePunjabgovernment banned preaching on university campuses, and banned Tableeghi Jamaat (and other non-students) from preaching and staying in campus hostels.

**2019–20 coronavirus pandemic**

****Tablighi Jamaat attracted significant public and media attention during the2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. Between 27 February and 1 March 2020, the movement organised an international mass religious gathering at a mosque inSri Petaling,Kuala LumpurinMalaysia. The Tablighi Jamaat gathering has been linked to more than 620COVID-19cases, making it the largest-known centre of transmission of the virus in Southeast Asia. The Sri Petaling event resulted in the biggest increase inCovid-19 cases in Malaysia, with almost two thirds of the 673 confirmed cases in Malaysia linked to this event by 17 March 2020.Most of the Covid-19 cases inBruneioriginated here, and other countries includingSingapore, Thailand,Cambodia,Vietnamand thePhilippineshave traced their cases back to this event. Despite the outbreak, Tablighi Jammat organised a second international mass gathering on 18 March inGowa RegencynearMakassarinSouth Sulawesi,Indonesia. Though the organisers initially rebuffed official directives to cancel the gathering, they subsequently complied and cancelled the gathering.

**Pakistan**

 Yet another gathering was organised in Pakistan nearLahoreatRaiwind, for 250,000 people.The event was "called off" in response to the officials' requests, but the participants had already gathered and communed together. When they returned the virus travelled with them, including two cases in theGaza strip.During testing around 40 members of the jamat were found to be COVID infected. Another 50 people including 4 Nigerian women, suspected to be the carriers of the virus were quarantined 50km from Lahore. InHyderabad, Sindh, 38 members of the jamaat were found to be positive for coronavirus. Raiwind, the place where the event was held has been locked down by Pakistani authorities while the police arrested Tablighi Jamaat members from their offices in Sindh and Punjab for violating the law.Later, during the quarantine, a member of the organisation stabbed a policemen while trying to escape from the isolation facility. He was later arrested in Khyber Pakthunwa while the policeman was hospitalized in Layyah town. During this crisis, the Pakistan government found itself in a helpless situation. While initially the Prime minister Imran Khan downplayed the pandemic, the country saw a rapid rise in cases with limited testing facilities. The problem was further aggravated by doctors not reporting to work, clerics refusing to shut down mosques, parents unwilling to quarantine their children in congested homes as they play on the streets.Ninety four more Tableeghi Jamaat members tested positive for the corona virus on 31 March, 2020 in Hyderabad, in the Sindh province.

**India**

 TheNizamuddin factionof the Tablighi Jamaat held a religious congregational program inNizamuddin West, Delhi. There was anIjtema(congregation) in every week of March till March 21. The Delhi Government's order of 13 March that no seminars, conferences or any big event (beyond 200 people) are to be held was apparently ignored by the organisation, and the government also failed to enforce it. There were also other violation of rules by foreign speakers including misuse of tourist visa for missionary activities and not taking 14-day home quarantine for travellers from abroad.

 At least 24 of the attendees had tested positive for the virus among the 300 who showed symptoms by 31 March 2020.It is believed that the sources of infection were preachers from Indonesia.Many had returned to their states and also provided refuge to foreign speakers without the knowledge of local governments.and eventually started local transmissions especially inTamil Nadu,Telengana,Karnataka,Jammu and KashmirandAssam. The entireNizamuddin Westarea has been cordoned off by the Police as of 30 March, and medical camps have been set up.After evacuation from the markaz, of the scores of jamaat attendees, 167 of them were quarantined in a railway facility in south east Delhi amid concerns over their safety and transmission of the virus. The Tablighi Jamaat gathering emerged as one of India's major coronavirus hotspots in India,after 1445 out of 4067 cases were linked to attendees according to the Health Ministry.

 Questions have been raised as to how theDelhi Policeallowed this event to proceed in the midst of a pandemic,while a similar event was prohibited in Mumbai by theMaharashtra Police.Once the COVID lockdown came into effect in Delhi from 22 March onwards, the missionaries remaining in the Nizamuddin Markaz were trapped, and the functionaries began to seek assistance from the authorities for their evacuation. As on April 5th, more than 30% cases India were related to Tablighi Jamaat and this has increase the rate of positive cases getting doubled from an earlier 7.4 days to 4.1 days i.e. now every 4.1 days cases are getting doubled in India.On 31 March 2020, anFIRwas filed againstMuhammad Saad Kandhlawiand others by Delhi Police Crime Branch under Section 3 (penalty for offence) of theEpidemic Diseases Act, 1897and Sections 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease), 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) and 120b (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.
