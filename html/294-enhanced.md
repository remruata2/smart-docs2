Subject: Threat assessment in respect of Pu C.Lalrosanga, MP (LS).

Ref. : No.MCID/VIP Security/2013/264 Dt.19th December, 2019

Sir,

 In compliance to your letter no. and subject mentioned above, assessment of security threat in respect of Pu C.Lalrosanga, MP Lok Sabha, resident of Tuikual North, Aizawl, Mizoram was conducted and sources, contacts, informants and operatives were approached.

 Presently, Pu C.Lalrosanga, MP is staying at New Delhi to look after his daughter–in law namely Pi Saimawii who is currently undergoing breast cancer treatment in AIIMS Hospital. It is learnt that several precautionary advices were being received by him &amp; his family from known persons and also from unknown persons due to the recent issue of CAB/CAA. They sometimes felt a sense of uneasiness and discomfort for their safety and that of their family. Upon further enquiry, it was also learnt that the said MP, Pu C.Lalrosanga had neither received any direct or indirect life threatening words nor received any threat report from his PSOs.

  Taking into account the security threat that could emanates from different angles, it is concluded that the threat perceived either direct or indirect is minimal at present. Considering the nature of the present situation in connection with CAA issue with the possibility of a security breach and in order to enable his family to move freely without fear, it is most suitable that he may retained the temporary House Guards provided to him i.e One Havildar &amp; two constables including two Personal Security Officers (PSO).

 Submitted for kind information and further necessary action please.

Yours faithfully,

**(K.LALREMSANGA)**
