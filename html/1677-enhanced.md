**NOTES ON CHAKMAS OF MIZORAM**

_Origin in Mizoram, when did they come and how? :_

The Chakmas first entered Mizoram as porters/coolie of British army who conducted Lushai Expedition in 1872 A.D from Chittagong Hill Tracts (Bangladesh). Later, few Chakma families began to settle in Mizoram in 1905. They were listed in tribes list in 1956.

Chakmas showed it first trace in Mizoram somewhere near to river Thega (western Mizoram).The first Chakma immigration took place in between 1895 – 1905 when Vannawla, Chief of Lunginkhar (now within Bangladesh) sent his son Zakhupa with some of his Chakam subjects to his land Muallianpui (now within Mizoram) to make a new village at Sakhai (Borapansuri). Jaiawdar, Kharbari of Diblibagh village situated 8 kilometre north of Tlabung stated that the first migrants including him came from Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh (CHT) in 1905. Most of them settled near Diblibagh and Tablibagh.

The second migration took place when Chakmas made settlement on the bank of river Kawrpui, not far from Khanglui (Khojoysuri) owing to fertile and vacant portion of the land. In 1918 few Chakmas came to Mizoram and settled at Marpara and Phuldungsei. In 1925 they settled at Aivapui and Mualvawm within the chief’s land of Phuldungsei.

As per the Order No. 5 of 1954 issued by Mr. K.G.R. Iyer, the then Deputy Commissioner of Lushai Hills under Memo No. GP/21/54/52, Dated Aizawl, the 2nd July, 1954, it was directed to all chiefs and headmen in the Lushai Hills District that no influx of Chakmas and Tripuras will be allowed without the prior permission in writing of the Deputy Commissioner, Lushai Hills. Howsoever, with effect from 29-04-1972, the new Chakma District (Chakma Autonomous District Council) is formed in the southern part of Mizoram under the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India as per the Mizoram District Councils (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order, 1972 Dt. 5-5-1972.

_Where did they settle?_

Out of Mizoram’s eight districts the people of Chakma live in three districts viz. Lawngtlai, Lunglei and Mamit. The 'Chakma Autonomous District Council(CADC)' was formed under the Sixth schedule of the Constitution of India on April 29, 1972 (now within western part of Lawngtlai and Lunglei District) and the some Chakma inhabiting areas remained excluded from CADC area(as in Mamit District).The CADC has a land area of 1500 square kilometresand the population grew from 34,528 in 2001 to 43,528 (as of 2011).The total Chakma population of Mizoram is estimated to be more than 100,000. The literacy rate of Chakma Autonomous District Council is 68% as per census conducted by the Education Department of CADC in the year 2011.

**_Issues & Problems of Mizoram Chakmas-Response of State Government_**

_(i)Displacement by Border fencing:_

Mizoram Chakma Development Forum (MCDF) claimed that about 49.7% of the total Chakma population in Mizoram has lost their houses, lands, cultivation fields and others properties due to the ongoing India-Bangladesh border fencing in Mizoram.

On 21 April 2006, the State Government constituted a “State Level Co-ordination Committee on Border Fencing” to ensure that the victims received proper compensation and rehabilitation.

(ii)_Demand of removal of Chakma from Category-I in the State Technical Entrance Examination (STEE):_

Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) General Headquarters organized a series of protest against the inclusion of Chakmas and other non-indigenous students under Category-I under the State Technical Entrance Examination (STEE). The MZP General Headquarters claimed that Chakmas are not indigenous people of the State of Mizoram and therefore should be excluded from the Category-I in the State Technical Entrance Examination (STEE).Due to this protest movement 13 (thirteen) student leaders were arrested by Mizoram Police.

On 25.9.2014, thousands of students took out a protest rally within Aizawl City and in different part of Mizoram forcing the government to reach an agreement with the agitating students’ leaders.

The Central Young Mizo Association (CYMA) also strongly argued that Chakmas are never indigenous people of Mizoram and supported the initiatives of MZP for the exclusion of Chakmas as indigenous people of Mizoram under Category-I in STEE.

_(iii)Chakma Foreigner Illegal Settlement in Mizoram (illegal immigration):_

Concerned over an “abnormal increase” of Chakmapopulationin southern Mizoram, the state’s largest organisation Young Mizo Association has decided to conduct a census on Chakmapopulationin the stateto checkChakma infiltration.

 Pu.R.Lalzirliana, Home Minister ,etc called upon the Young Mizo Association leaders to cooperate with the government in properly maintaining village register which is meant for keeping record of genuine settlers of each village. He further suggested that a systematic plan be made such that this village register is tabled in the Legislative Session, adding, the same would be a good means of preventing illegal entry of outsiders.

_(iv) Construction of Zofate Chawlhbuk ( Zofate Resthouse) at Borapansury:_

Amidst a strong protest from Chakma Community, MZP General Headquarters is constructing Zofate Chawlhbuk (Zofate Resthouse) at Borapansury. The Chakmas claimed that such activity of student body amounted to illegal land encroachment/grabbing within CADC area.
