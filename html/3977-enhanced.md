**Subject : **Threat Assessment Report of Former Chief Minister****

Ref:  Letter No. D.32019/1/2024-IIMS, dated 25.02.2025 and Request from Pu Zoramthanga for increasing PSOs from 2 to 4.

Sir

A thorough Threat Assessment was conducted to evaluate the security of former Chief Minister Pu Zoramthanga. The assessment involved a site visit to his residence, consultations with key Mizo National Front (MNF) party leaders and individuals closely associated with him, and analysis of open-source intelligence. The inspection revealed that his residence is equipped with CCTV cameras to secure the perimeter; however, no security personnel are stationed at the property.

**Findings of the Assessment:**

Historical and Political Significance: Pu Zoramthanga played a central role in the Mizo National Front (MNF) insurgency and was instrumental in negotiating the Mizoram Peace Accord of 1986, which resolved decades of conflict. His transition from a militant leader to a prominent political figure, serving three terms as Chief Minister of Mizoram, has established him as a highly influential leader in Northeast India.

Role in Peace Negotiations and Ethnic Advocacy: Pu Zoramthanga has served as a mediator in peace negotiations between insurgent groups and the Government of India. His vocal support for the Kuki-Zo ethnic group during the Manipur conflict has drawn significant criticism from certain groups, particularly the Meitei community. The public burning of his effigy in Manipur reflects heightened tensions and potential threats arising from his political positions and advocacy for Zo ethnic groups.

_Security Risks:_ His outspoken support for the Kuki-Zo community has made him a target for extremist elements within the Meitei community and other opposing factions. Given his high-profile status, Pu Zoramthanga and his family face risks of kidnapping, intimidation, or physical harm from disgruntled groups or individuals. His advocacy for the reunification of Zo tribes (Mizo, Kuki, Chin, and related ethnic groups) across India, Myanmar, and Bangladesh further elevates his visibility and vulnerability.

_Threat Level:_ The assessment confirms that Pu Zoramthanga faces significant risks due to his historical role, past peacekeeping efforts, and involvement in sensitive issues such as the Manipur conflict.

****Current Context:** Several months have passed since Pu Zoramthanga last held the office of Chief Minister, and his public role has become increasingly limited. While potential threats may persist, it is recommended that his security arrangements be reviewed and aligned with those provided to other former Chief Ministers to reflect his current level of exposure.**

**Recommendation:** Given the identified risks and his reduced public engagement, a reassessment of Pu Zoramthanga’s security measures is advised to ensure they are proportionate to the current threat level while maintaining adequate protection.
