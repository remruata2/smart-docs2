Subject: Execution of repair/Maintenance work on Sairang – Tuipuibari road :  Security of BRO personnel – regarding.

Ref:  No.PHQ/OPS-47/LOOSE/13/02 Dt.4.1.2016.

Sir,

 Apropos the above, I am sending herewith the assessment and situation report regarding provision of security to the 115 RCC personnel.

 Careful investigation on the possibilities of threat against staff of 115 RCC Project Pushpak (BRTF), who are undertaking maintaining works of Sairang to Tuipuibari road(stretch from Km 32 to 42 and Km 82-164) from underground elements, was conducted by Inspr. Malsawma Royte, Field Staff of CID(SB).

 The enquiry officer found that as of now the area is relatively peaceful and no imminent threat to the security of BRTF personnel working in the area is perceived from NLFT or any Bru militants. Even the O/C of BRTF and his staff have not received any intimidation, threat or demand from underground element operating within the area since 2014. However, the possibilities of taking advantages of the situation by local miscreants need to be watched. According to reports from OC/JE BRTF and SDPO, West Phaileng, maintaining works is being undertaken by BRTF on these roads without any police escort.

 Considering the above situation, providing regular police protection/escort to 115 RCC personnel undertaking maintenance work of Sairang to Tuipuibari road (stretch from Km 32 to 42 and Km 82-164) road may not be necessary. However, as a precautionary measure Mizoram police and BSF personnel may continue regular patrolling within the area. The office of the undersigned is also closely monitoring movements and activities of NLFT, Bru militants operating in these areas.

 This is for your kind information and necessary action.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
