Dated: 31st July, 2020.

Information has been received that various business and transport associations of Champhai as well as Chhungte village community are having resentment and appears to be developing an anti-Assam Rifles (AR) sentiment mainly due to various activities of AR in the area, particularly setting up of duty post by AR at Khankawn within Chhungte village jurisdiction.

As per input, on the night of 18.7.2020, 25 (twenty five) trucks transported around 2000 bags of Areca Nut from various godowns of Champhai and left Champhai for Aizawl via Dungtlang. They were intercepted and seized by 8th AR at the outskirt of Chawngtlai and they were escorted to Champhai.

In protest against the above seizure, around 60 (sixty) persons of Champhai engaging in various businesses having linkage with Areca Nut business gathered at Champhai by-pass road, near Khankawn Police Checkgate, Champhai on 21.7.2020 @2:00 p.m. They gathered at the said location to prevent the AR from handing over the seized Areca Nut to Custom Preventive Force, Champhai. SDO (Sadar) and SDPO Champhai immediately rushed to the spot and the situation was brought under control. 28 truckloads of Areca Nuts seized by AR (including 3 trucks seized by AR at Hnahlan road) amounting to 2438 bags were handed over by the AR and they were deposited at 4 (four) selected godowns as per the order of Deputy Commissioner, Champhai.

In the meantime, Chhungte VC and Branch YMA, Champhai district issued a joint Press Release on 29.7.2020 which highlighted the following points:

i) It demanded AR to vacate their duty post set up at Chhungte VC area, i.e., at Khankawn, on or before 3.8.2020, failing which they will take necessary actions for their evacuation. It stated that frequent shifting of duty posts by AR and their conduct of vehicle checking at Khankawn makes the people of Chhungte and Champhai vulnerable to COVID-19 as AR is having high number of COVID-19 positive cases in Mizoram.

ii) AR should confine their duty at the Mizoram-Myanmar border.

iii) Chhungte is located at more than 10 kms from the border and is under Champhai Town Area and opposed being managed like a disturbed area.

In view of the above, Champhai Police convened a meeting with leaders of Chhungte village on 30.7.2020. The village leaders pointed out their concern over the presence of AR Check Post within the village area and their frequent checking of vehicles makes the residents vulnerable to COVID-19. Police authorities informed them that any attempt to initiate forceful eviction of AR from their current location without proper order from the government will be prevented by the Police with all resources available at its disposal. The village leaders assured the Police that they will not resort to violent or physical means to effect evacuation of AR from the said location.

Situation is under close watch.
