Sir,

 With reference to the above cited letter number, a comprehensive security threat assessment for the below mentioned officials was conducted by self as directed. The report of which is as indicated below-

1. **Shri S.B. Shashank, IAS**

Being the present Chief electoral Officer of Government of Mizoram, he is greatly observe by political parties and NGOs in a democratic state like Mizoram where peoples representatives are elect by the public. It is known that CEO’s responsibilities falls from drafting/finalizing of electoral roll till processing of Elections, due to this, CEO’s efforts on election matters are closely observe by the public. It is therefore considered that the said official be continued to stay in a protected list and that provision of PSO also be continued.

1. **Lalnunmawia Chuaungo, IAS**

Pu Lalnunmawia Chuaungo, IAS is presently holding the post of Principal Secretary, Home &amp; Finance in Government of Mizoram. Since his post comes with upholding Law and Order within the State, it is therefore necessary to continue to include the said official in a protected list as his designation deserves eventhough a direct and indirect threat may not be known in the past and present, provision of PSO be continued.

1. **Pu Lalduhawma, President ZNP**

He is the president of ZNP and the Chief Ministerial candidate of ZPM for the upcoming MLA election. It is known that he frequently travelled around Mizoram state campaigning for his party, it is also a fact that he will be contested in the said upcoming election also. Therefore it is considered that it is the state government’s responsibility to provide PSO to the said person although direct or indirect threat might not be known.

1. **Prof. J.V. Hluna, President, BJP**

Since he is the present leader of BJP Mizoram state, he regularly travels around Mizoram state. It is also known that he will be contested in the upcoming MLA election and for the said reason, providing PSO for the said person be continued though presence of direct of indirect threat might not be known.

1. **Dy. Residence Commissioner, Silchar, Mizoram House**

Pi Saizikpuii, MCS is presently posted as Dy. Residence Commissioner having two PSOs. It is known that unforeseen communal tension between Mizoram state and Assam state occasionally flared up in the past recent years. Though peace between the two states was retained at present, the said official’s intervention in the activities of NGOs and other criminals was often needed as well. Moreover, the said official often needed to travel in and out of the two states- Mizoram and Assam since their office used to do Bank Transaction only at Treasury Office, Kolasib, Mizoram which is hectic for only one PSO. Therefore it is considered that the said official be continued to provide two PSOs.

1. **Pu Hmingchungnunga, Chairman, SHDC**

Pu Hmingchungnunga, the present chairman of SHDC tenure will be ended on dt. 31.5.2018, a farewell programme will also be held with his colleagues i.e. other SHDC members along with his office staffs. Regarding the provision of PSO, it is a fact that the underground outfit HPC(D) who often posed a threats for the said official had recently signed MoS with the Government of Mizoram and his previous direct/indirect intimidations from the said outfit no longer exist as of now. Due to this, it is no longer necessary to provide PSO and House Guard for the said official as he himself also felt unnecessary for the Government to continue providing him such security.

 Yours faithfully
