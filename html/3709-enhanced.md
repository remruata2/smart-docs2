 During interrogation, it was revealed that they are members of Bangladesh-based Mogh Bahini, a militant outfit also known as Mogh Liberation Party (MLP). They stated that they have three camps inside Bangladesh and that Bangalhali is their main camp which is located near a Bangladeshi Army camp. The cadre strength according to them in their main camp is approximately 80. The two other camps of their outfit are based at Paitu Para in Rangamati District and Chakhua Para. Also in Rangamati District, Bangladesh. They also stated that the outfit had a good understanding with the Bangladeshi Army.

 As per their statement, the main reason for them entering into Indian territory is that having left their outfit and fearing for their lives at the hands of MLP, they chose to come to Aizawl, Mizoram since Saching Marma already had an acquaintance and also to search for a potential workplace due to financial crisis in Bangladesh.
