Signing of MoS between Hmar Peoples&rsquo; Convention (HPC) and the State of Mizoram</span></strong><span style="font-size:14.0pt">: In 1986 the Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) was formed with the sole objective of the creation of an Autonomous District Council (ADC) for the Hmars within Mizoram. Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent unlawful activities like abducting and killing of the Mizoram Police personnel, extorting money etc. and thus jeopardising the law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area.The Government of Mizoram managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants resulting in the signing of a Peace Accord on 27th July 1994. The HPC militants surrendered formally to the Govt. of Mizoram as per the provision of this Accord and these persons were given financial grants for their rehabilitation etc. The Govt. of Mizoram also agreed to set up the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) for the socio-economic upliftment of the people living in the Hmar dominated areas. Accordingly adhoc Chairman and members constituting the council were even appointed by the Govt. of Mizoram from among the leaders of the erstwhile HPC set up. Peace was thus restored in Mizoram after the signing of the Accord.</span></span></span></p>
