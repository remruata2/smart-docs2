 Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhiti Samiti (PCJSS) or United People’s Party of the Chittagong Hill Tracts was formed on 17th February, 1972 with the aim of establishing the right of self-determination of the Jumma peoples (tribal group of people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts). Its military arm, theShanti Bahiniwas used to fight the government forces in the Hill Tracts. APeace Accordwas later signed on 2nd December, 1997 which led to the disarmament of the Shanti Bahini and enabled the PCJSS to return to mainstream politics. However, dissatisfied with the non implementation of the agreement between PCJSS and the Bangladesh Government, some members of PCJSS started fighting with the Bangladesh Government since 2008 which often involved arms conflicts. The alias of PCJSS mentioned in the Press Release, JSS (Santu Group) is not an official organisation but merely the same political party, PCJSS is currently headed by Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma alias Santu Larma. The present status of the mentioned villages alleged to have military training camps of PCJSS inside Mizoram is as follow:-

Further, there is no report of  presence of arms and ammunitions or members of PCJSS undergoing training  at the transit camp.

(b)  Tara Banya (Terabonia) – No transit camp.

(c)  Chumochumi (Sumasumi) – No transit camp.

(d)  Malchari/Malsuri – Family members of some members of PCJSS are camped  at the so called Family Quarters at the vicinity of Malsuri village. There are a  total of 20 houses out of which 2 are unoccupied.

Further, the alleged Company Commander at Amchari camp, Binanta Chakma (Binanda Chakma as per PARMRA Press Release) is a 36 years old resident of Amchari (Amchurimukh) locality of Rajiv Nagar.
