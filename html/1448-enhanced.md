****BRIEF NOTE ON BRU REPATRIATION PROCESS****

 There were 5481 Bru families at the 6 Bru Transit Camps in Tripura on the basis of electoral roll till August, 2018. A quadri-lateral agreement was signed between the Union Government, Mizoram Government, Tripura Government and MBDPF on 3.7.2018 for repatriation of these Brus before the end of September, 2018.

 However, an organization called Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples Co-ordination Committee (MBDPCC) was formed by those who opposed the quadric-lateral agreement until the additional demands made by them were not implemented which had prevented many from submitting their willingness for repatriation.

 In pursuance of this agreement 33 Bru families who were willing to come back were repatriated from 24.8.2018 till 30.9.2018 on 5 occasions. (Details shown below):

 During the process of repatriation, the Bru families were escorted by Tripura Government officials till Mizoram border where they were received by Mizoram Government Officials and were properly escorted by Police. Those who were to be resettled in Mamit Districts were dropped off at the same day to their place of temporary Shelter while others who were to be resettled in Kolasib and Lunglei District were put up for one night at 4th IR Bn Hqrs, Luangpawl from where they continued their journey the next day. Kolasib District Brus were put up at temporary shelter the next day from which their final resettlements were to be arranged. Those going back to Lunglei Districts were halted at 2nd MAP Hqrs, Lunglei after they left Mamit District from which they were transported to Tlabung where they were to be finally resettled. These Brus are presently put up at a temporary shelter at Dinthar area, Tlabung before final resettlement in the same area. The repatriated Bru families were escorted by Officials including Police security escorts during their entire journey. Those who are put up at Dinthar, Tlabung are still provided security with 1 section of 2nd MAP personnel under the supervision of SDPO, Tlabung. No untowards incident occurred during the repatriation process nor any law and order problem is expected in connection with these repatriated Brus.

 These repatriated Bru will cast their votes at the place where they were enrolled. However, in connection with the Brus still remaining in Tripura Transit Camps, The Election Commission of India had decreed in 2014 that no Brus in the Transit Camps will be allowed to cast their votes at their camps in 2018 Assembly Election. It is highly anticipated that arrangement will be made for them to cast their votes at a selected location near Tripura border in Mizoram (most probably Kanhmun, Mamit District). Further, arrangement will be made by Election Directorate for which necessary security arrangement will be provided by District SP, Mamit under the aegis of Police Headquarters, Mizoram.
