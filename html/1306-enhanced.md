****Enhance Technical Capability of Intelligence Agency in Combating Terrorism:****

Terrorism is not a new phenomenon, but it has become more prominent during recent decades. Terrorist attacks have included not only political assassinations, but also large-scale attacks, often aimed at third parties, causing massive casualties. Common forms of terroristsattack are car bombings, explosion of high explosives, and attacks on security personnel, abduction etc.

Due to development of information technology, the Internet offers a simple access to a global stage, every terrorist could instantly reach large masses or targets specific groups of individuals. Under specific circumstances, the resources of the Internet could offer anonymity to the user, a great advantage for a terrorist organization that wants to spread their message while remaining undetected.The internet is cheap; a group of terrorists could arrange efficient propaganda campaigns without economic effort.

The Internet, and generally speaking technology, could be exploited by terrorist organizations for several purposes including Propaganda, Psychological warfare, Recruitment and mobilization, Fundraising, Data Mining, information gathering, Secure communications, Cyber-attacks, Software distribution (e.g., mobile app), Buying false documents, Training.Purchasing weapons, Download Mobile Apps used for secure communications, Purchase of malicious code, Fund-raising, etc.

Further, the cyberspace is an environment without boundaries, a privileged place where terrorists find resources, make propaganda activities and from which it is possible to launch the attacks against enemies everywhere in the world. Social media is an essential element of modern terrorism; these powerful platforms allow terrorists to communicate, to make propaganda and recruit new sympathizers. Although members of the Islamic state use new technologies with great skill, many other terrorist groups use the Internet and its resources every day.

The Internet propaganda is probably the most common use of technology by terrorist organizations. Groups like the ISIS demonstrated a great mastery of the technology and a deep knowledge of the techniques of communication.

Social media is a privileged instrument of propaganda; this means that analyzing them it is possible to follow the events and their geographic location. Social media platforms and forums are used by terrorist organizations to share propaganda and training material.Terrorists use the new social platforms like Facebook, Twitter and media services such as YouTube. Their language is direct, young, and it can reach a specific audience by using images with a high emotional impact.

The Internet is a mine for terrorists; it includes precious information that could be used by terrorist to attack specific targets. The analysis of Open Sources allows attackers to collect data on targets and allow terrorists to conduct a passive reconnaissance.

Many web services could be used to obtain information related to a specific place that terrorists intend to attack. Google Maps could give attackers aerial photo of the location of the attack; these pictures could reveal the presence of supervisory staff, checkpoints, fence, entry points and much more.

Modern terrorists make a large use of mobile applications and other solutions for secure communications. Terrorist group named Mujahideenof Al-Qaeda used the following tools for secret communication:

1. Tashfeeral-Jawwal,a mobile encryption platform developed by the Global Islamic Media Front (GIMF) and released in September 2013.
2. Asraral-Ghurabaa, another alternative encryption program developed by theIslamic State of Iraq and Al-Shamand released in November 2013, around the same time the group broke away from the main Al-Qaedafollowinga power struggle.
3. Amnal-Mujahid,an encryption software program developed by Al-FajrTechnicalCommittee whichis a mainstream Al-Qaeda organization and released in December 2013.

India also experienced used of technology by terrorist in 2008 Mumbai attack. It stunned authorities not only with their use of sophisticated weaponry but also with their comfort with modern technology. The terrorists navigated across the Arabian Sea to Mumbai from Karachi, Pakistan, with the help of global positioning system handset. While under way, they communicated using a satellite phone with those in Pakistan believed to have coordinated the attacks. They recognized their targets and knew the most direct routes to reach them in part because they had studied satellite photos from Google Earth. The Pakistani-based handlers communicated with the attackers using internet phones that complicate efforts to trace and intercept calls and they also inform the attackers.

From the above statement, it is believed that terrorist groups in India and its neighboring countries are also using advance technology; internet etc. for communication and execution of their work, in order to collect advance intelligence on their activity usesophisticated technology is much needed. Intelligence agencies are facing many challenges due to technological advancement. Some smugglers and terrorists are also using Social Media applications viz. WhatsApp, Facebook Messengers, Instagram, Encrypted text etc. in order to avoid call interception by Law enforcement agencies. To overcome these challenges, enhancement of technological capabilities of intelligences agencies is the need of the hour. Intelligence agencies should be equipped with sophisticated advance technology like Arms Scanner, Binoculars including night vision, drone, interceptor, secret communication device, decryption device, social media monitoring device, social media analytics tools etc.
