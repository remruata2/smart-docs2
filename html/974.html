Its purpose is to alleviate insecurity of tribals living along India and Myanmar Border as they still continue to have trans-border linkages with their kiths and kins. This regime has been in place to protect traditional social relations among border people. It helps genuine people living in the close proximity of the border. India and Myanmar share1,643 km unfenced border along four states viz. Arunachal Pradesh (520 km), Nagaland (215km), Manipur (398 km) and Mizoram (510 km) and permit free movement regime upto 16 km beyound border.
