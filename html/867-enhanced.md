****INDO-BANGLA BORDER ISSUES … (Draft)****

**Sealing of Indo-Bangla Borders & Establishment of Border Protection Grid**

Mizoram shares 318 Km long international boundary with Bangladesh. These porous international borders with Bangladesh served as important routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs. The porous border areas have also widely encouraged other criminal activities like abduction/ kidnapping of Indian citizens by Bangladesh based insurgent groups.

 In order to curb the infiltration, smuggling and other anti-national activities from across the Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government has undertaken the construction of fencing along this border.

 The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was 344.41 Km out of which about 70% work have been completed.

 According to Mizoram State Boundary Committee, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram are now within Bangladesh side of the border due to irresponsibility of the construction companies who are fencing the Mizoram- Bangladesh border. The Boundary Committee also found that the fences pass through the middle of 20 other villages.

 Border fencing work could not be undertaken along a 60-km stretch in the Dampa Tiger Reserve owing to pending clearances from the National Board of Wildlife, which has demanded that the State transfer of around 1,520 hectares of non-forestland in compensation.

 Mizoram Chakma Development Forum (MCDF) claimed that about 49.7% of the total Chakma population in Mizoram has lost their houses, lands, cultivation fields and others properties due to the ongoing India-Bangladesh border fencing in Mizoram. On 21 April 2006, the State Government constituted a “State Level Co-ordination Committee on Border Fencing” to ensure that the victims received proper compensation and rehabilitation.

 In order to seal the Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government has adopted multi-pronged approach which include construction of fencing, floodlighting, Border Out Posts (BoPs), induction of latest surveillance equipments like Hand Held Thermal Imagers (HHTI), Night vision Goggle/Devices, etc.

**Ops briefing on IBB & Strengthening of Border Area Crime Control and Security & Monitoring Frame Work**

 In order to detect and deport settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram , 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.

 Mizoram Police have so far arrested 59 Bangladesh nationals illegally entering Mizoram during 2008-2016(till November, 2016).

 Illegal migration is significantly altering the demographic pattern of the border districts adjoining Bangladesh. While our general approach has been to improve the front line of the Border Security Force(BSF). It is also necessary that the State Governments be given assistance by the Centre to set-up civil police stations which could act as second layer behind the BSF/Border Out Posts (BOPs) to keep effective watch on happenings in border villages.

**Border Flood Lights**

 The progress of floodlighting work as on 31.12.2015 along Mizoram -Bangladesh border is as follows:

 Completed : 335.66 km.

 Sanctioned : 51.11km.

**Border Roads**

****Along Mizoram-Bangladesh Border, a stretch of 303.97 km. length of border patrol-roads has also been constructed out of the sanctioned length of about 602. 28 km.

**Border Out Posts(BOPs)**

****The BOPs are meant to provide appropriate show of force to deter trans-border criminals, infiltrators and the hostile elements from indulging in the activities of intrusion/ encroachment and border violations.

 Out of the total of 91 Border Out-Posts (BOPs) approved , the construction in respect of 18 BOPs has been completed and the work in other 73 BOPs are yet to be established along Mizoram-Bangladesh Borders. There are 3 Battalions of BSF in Mizoram presently. They are under a DIG and deployed along the 318 Kms long Indo-Bangladesh border. BSF Sector Headquarters is located in Durtlang, Aizawl.

 Mizoram Police had separately deployed security personnel (IR Bn) along Indo-Bangladesh border and the expenditure incurred for performing such security duties were borned by the state government.

 It is therefore suggested that some discretionary component may be introduced under Security Related Expenditure (SRE) by Central Government so that state of Mizoram could act as effective layer behind Central Paramilitary Forces for safeguarding the territory of India.
