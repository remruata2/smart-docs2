 Arms consignment mentioned above which was concealed in a false tailboard of vehicle R/No. ML-05 D/1186 (Bolero Camper) driven by the accused was recovered and seized at Vairengte Excise Check Gate on 5.7.2008. However, the accused had managed to run away from the PO while seizure of the same was made. Even though it could not be known from where the consignment was brought, it was strongly believed that the same was to be given to some UG outfits presumably the DHD (J).
