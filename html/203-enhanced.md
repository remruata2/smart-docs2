Subj :- Assessment of threat perception.

Ref :- No: SEC/R-40/2016/376 Dt. 10.10.2017

Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, assessment of security threat in respect of Passport Seva Kendra (PSK), Aizawl Mizoram was conducted. The information so collected, as a result of this assessment concluded that the threat perceived either direct or indirect against Passport Seva Kendra (PSK), Aizawl at present is minimal.

 Pu C.Vanlalhruaia, Deputy Director, Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) was also approached and had an interaction with him in regard to the threat perception of Passport Seva Kendra (PSK). He stated that he had neither received any direct or indirect threat nor received any reports on threat from his staffs. He further stated that the security requisition he had made was simply based on the instruction he had received from the Regional Passport Officer (RPO) Guwahati to minimize the office expenditure and not out of security threat perceived. At present, Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) is engaging JC Security Pvt. Firm to provide security and JC Security Pvt. Firm is providing 2 (two) personnel round the clock duty.

 Taking into account the security threat that could emanates from different angles, it may be concluded that security requisition was made by Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) merely to minimize the Office expenses incurred on security arrangement and not because of threat perception.

 Submitted for favour of kind information and further necessary action please.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
