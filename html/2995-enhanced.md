**1. HPC(D) council meeting held on 13.9.2011(not 30.9.2011) at an undisclosed location in Churachandpur discussed about HPC(D) joining KNO group as per green signal given by their President Lalhmingthang Sanate. After lengthy deliberation and hot debate on the topic, the council meeting decided not to join KNO and even persuaded their President to withdraw his earlier decision which the President reportedly agreed.**

****2. HPC(D) High Command led by S/S Army Chief Ropuia in a secret meeting held on 29.9.2011 at Churachandpur is plotting to impeach its President Lalhmingthanga Sanate. As per the input, Lalhmingthanga Sanate no longer enjoys the majority support of his Cabinet colleagues because of his recent agreement to join the KNO without consulting his Cabinet. It is learnt that the President has also been charged of misappropriating party fund.****

****While the HPC(D) President is being impeached on charges of misappropriation of party fund, the fact remains that his impeachment has something to do with the ensuing Manipur Assembly Election which is due in February next year. As per the input received, differences between the President and his cabinet had manifested since last one month when Lalhmingthanga Sanate reportedly signed an agreement to join the KNO group without consulting his colleagues. Input received suggests that Lalhmingthanga's idea of joining the KNO was to gain some political mileage even outside the Hmar dominated areas of Manipur while his army chief and others were trying to back up an individual candidate(s) who are otherwise not in the list of those likely to be backed up by the KNO.****

**Intelligence input received further stated that Lalhmingthanga is trying to convince Thangsiama, S/S Commander to join his side, saying that he, as a founder President, felt being humiliated for being impeached on false charges. It is also learnt that Thangsiama who is now in charge of about 11 nos. weapons of different types which are secretly kept outside the SoO agreement refused to give away the weapons under his charge and chose to remain neutral saying that he didn't want division in the organisation, and that he would rather make efforts for the unity of the organisation instead of taking sides.**

****S/S Commander Thangsiama who is presently staying in Churachandpur is also understood to be making a secret arms deal with one Thanga(Paite, who is known to have a secret link with ZRA). As per latest input received, 6 nos. of 'HK-53' smuggled from Chikha, Myanmar located close to Mizoram-Manipur border are being delivered and the transaction was likely on Sunday i.e. 2.10.2011.****

**It is learnt that while the S/S Army Chief Ropuia has majority support of the council members, the President is understood to be supported by Robert, S/S Defence Secretary, JC. Hmar, S/S Information Secretary and few cadres. Input received indicated further that Lalhmingthanga Sanate is still lobbying within the organisation as well as from outside such as Hmar Inpui, Hmar Student Association etc. insisting that he still enjoys support of more than 80% of the general Hmar people.**

**Impeachment of its president had resulted in both the factions trying to take control of their hidden weapons in Manipur as well as in Hmar demand areas of N.C. Hills, Assam. A group (7) loyal to Lalhmingthanga Sanate had taken out 8 nos. of weapons hidden in the jungle, north of Haflong on 27.10.2011 and headed for a location known as Khuanglung village about 3 hours journey on foot north of Haflong. The group was likely to move towards Haflong after burying the weapons and would follow jungle routes to avoid rival group led by Roger S/S PRO present in the area who were also trying to take control of the hidden weapons.**

**It may be recalled that Biaknunga S/S Dy. Chief of Army had taken control of weapons in Vangai Hills earlier during 2nd week of October, 2011.**

**Deposed HPC(D) President Lalhmingthanga Sanate is now hiding in Saikot and adjoining Khawpuibung area in Churachanpur, in a bid to regroup and to counter his rival factions. Lalhmingthanga Sanate has chosen this area as base Hqrs. believing that he has majority public support, and obviously as the jungle within the vicinity provides safe sanctuary in the event of possible army patrol in the area. Lalhmingthanga Sanate group had so far procured about 10-15 weapons of different type including 1(one) lethode with 9(nine) nos. of ammunitions out of which 9(nine) weapons are presently kept hidden in Mualhoi, NC.Hills.**

****Input suggests that armed confrontation between the two rival factions of HPC(D) could not be ruled out in the near future despite intervention by Hmar NGO and Church leaders as both the factions focus on Manipur State Legislative Assembly election which is due in February, 2012.****
