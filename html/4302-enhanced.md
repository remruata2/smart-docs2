****(a) Updates on development in Myanmar and Bangladesh having security implication in our territory (AR,BSF,SB/CID, Special Bureau, Military Int)****

**Myanmar** :

 **CNA/CDF**- Chinland Government/Council, formed by Chinland Joint Defence Committee (CJDC) is not accepted by some of the ethnic armed group including CDF Mindat, PDF Zoland and CNO/CNDF which called themselves as Chinland Brotherhood. As a result, there is tension between Chinland Council, mainly CNA and Chinland Brotherhood. The possibility of cross fire between these groups in the near future could not be ruled out. Further, the tension between Chinland Council and ZRA backed by Myanmar Army is increasing and there is a possibility that CNA may attack ZRA and Myanmar Army camped at Tedim.

 Inputs indicated that the Khumi National Defence Army (KNDA) did not appreciate the hoisting of Arakan Army flag at Paletwa Township. The Khumis had been claiming the areas of Paletwa Township as their ancestral home and latest inputs suggested that the Khumis from different part of the country are being recruited to join the Khumi National Defence Army (KNDA) to overthrow the Arakan Army from Paletwa Township. Further, there is a report of inhumane treatment of the Khumis by Arakan Army after the capturing of Paletwa which is in Chin State.

7 (seven) families consisting of 25 (twenty five) Myanmar Nationals had recently entered Mizoram and reached Tuidangchhuah Village in Lawngtlai District on 25.04.2024. These Myanmar Nationals from the Khumi community are mainly residents of Paletwa Township and its surrounding areas and are currently living with their friends and families at Tuidangchhuah Village. With this latest report of Influx of Myanmar Nationals, the total number of Myanmar Refugees in Mizoram is currently recorded as 34307 (thirty four thousand three hundred and seven).

The conflict between the ethic armed groups in Myanmar could resulted in another influx of civilians into Mizoram in large numbers.

The meeting not only reaffirmed the parties commitment to peace but also illustrated the potential for constructive dialogue in addressing longstanding issues. The next round of talks was scheduled to be held on 22.4.2024. However, the bank robberies of Bandarban Districts of Bangladesh conducted by KNA on 2.4.2024 have put all the efforts of the peace talks in question.
