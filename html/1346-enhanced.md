****WRITE UP ON FAILURE OF REPATRIATION OF BRU REFUGEES****

_Cause of Failure_:

 The leaders of MBDPF leaders encouraged the killing of Zarzokima of Bungthuam by rewarding money to the UG. Due to this incident, Laldawngliana was also arrested and MBDPF Asstt. General Secy. AJ.Vanlalhruaia was also forced by the MBDPF(who were against the repatriation process) leaders to join the UG militant thus, he joined the militant group.

 Bru UG militant used to threaten the refugees not to get themselves involved for the success of repatriation process. Moreover, the leaders of MBDPF frequently used to visit the different relief camp to encourage the refugees not to support any repatriation process.

 However, there are some people who did not fully support the MBDPF activities. Thus, these people used to deliver information regarding this to Mizoram Police intelligence. Among this people supporting repatriation is Elvis Chorkhy, the present MBDPF President who constantly received death threat from those people against repatriation process. They even threw him from his present post followed by a threat to his life if he continue to support the repatriation process.

 There is also a press release by the SS Commander, BNA, Hachhek Range, who called himself Nayaram, against the repatriation process.
