****NOTES ON SECURITY SCENARIO IN MIZORAM****

**A. Introduction :**

 Mizoram faces unique security challenges due to its geographical location. It is sandwiched between two foreign countries, Myanmar and Bangladesh, and shares borders with neighbouring states like Manipur, Assam, and Tripura, which have experienced instances of militancy. Consequently, heightened vigilance is necessary in all border areas.

Mizoram has a 510 km-long international border with Myanmar and a 318 km-long border with Bangladesh. The international border, although somewhat porous, is occasionally exploited by various insurgent groups for arms smuggling and the transit of militants.

**B. Issues related with Myanmar**:

1. **Myanmar Refugee**:

1. _Brief history_ –

The resistance efforts by the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and the armed ethnic groups in Chin State, Myanmar, have been ongoing to dismantle the military regime that seized power on February 1, 2021. This conflict has led to a significant influx of refugees, particularly from the Chin community, into Mizoram. Since the military coup, there have been eight major waves of Myanmar nationals seeking refuge in the state. Leaders of these ethnic groups convened for a workshop in Aizawl on September 7-8, 2023, with the aim of establishing an interim government in Chinland.

In addition to the Chin community, clashes between the Myanmar Army of the State Administration Council (SAC) and the Arakan Army in Rakhine State have intensified. Following the Arakan Army's capture of most major cities, members of the Khumi tribe have fled to southern Mizoram, reportedly escaping the Arakan Army’s atrocities.

 Since May 15, 2024, the Chin National Army (CNA), supported by various ethnic armed groups under the Chinland Council, launched a military operation against the State Administration Council’s Myanmar Army and the Eastern Command camps of the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) within Tonzang Township. By May 19, 2024, the CNA and its allies had reportedly seized most camps, including Dampui Camp (ZRA), Nakzaang Camp (Myanmar Army), Chikha Camp (Myanmar Army), Eliza Camp, Suansang (ZRA), and Tonzang Town Camp (Myanmar Army). By December 2024, the Chin Brotherhood Alliance had further captured Myanmar Army camps in Mindat, Matupi, Kanpetlet, Hakha, and Thantlang towns.

 During these clashes, the Myanmar Army retaliated with airstrikes on Tonzang Town, Nakzaang, and Lungtak villages, causing civilians to flee these areas. Fearing further airstrikes, many of these displaced individuals sought refuge and safety in neighboring villages within Mizoram.

1. **KMMTTP :**

 The Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) is a strategic infrastructure initiative by the Government of India. It involves a multimodal transport route that combines land, river, and sea segments to connect Northeast India with Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal. The route covers a distance of 882.21 kilometers and includes multiple modes of transportation.

**Lawngtlai to Zorinpui (Mizoram)**: land route 87.51 kms.

**Zorinpui Border to Kaletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 45 kms.

**Kaletwa to Paletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 60.70 kms.

**Paletwa to Sittwe (Myanmar)**: 150 km river route.

**Sittwe to Kolkata Port (Bay of Bengal)**: 539 km sea route.

 As of June 2024, construction of the KMMTTP land route within Mizoram is complete, although it is occasionally disrupted by landslides due to heavy rainfall. Meanwhile, owing to ongoing conflicts in Myanmar, only about 10 kilometers of earthwork has been completed on the land route between Zorinpui and Paletwa by the Myanmar New Power Construction Company, the firm assigned to the project.

 Since February 2024, the Arakan Army, which primarily consists of ethnic Arakanese from Myanmar's Rakhine State, has reportedly taken control of most of Rakhine State, including some parts of Chin State. This control extends over the proposed route of the KMMTTP within Myanmar, with the exception of Sittwe. However, due to ongoing clashes between the Myanmar Army and resistance forces elsewhere in Myanmar, the Arakan Army and the civilians in Rakhine State have become heavily reliant on goods and petroleum products transported largely through Mizoram, notably Lawngtlai and Siaha Districts. Concurrently, tensions between the Arakan Army and Chin ethnic armed groups in Myanmar have led the Central Young Lai Association (CYLA) to ban the transport of essential goods and petroleum oil into Myanmar, in solidarity with their Chin counterparts since April 2024. Currently, the ban is restricted only to the transportation of petroleum oil and fertilizers through Lawngtlai District.

1. **The Free Movement Regime along the Indo-Myanmar Border :**

_a)_****_Brief history :_

 The Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that enables citizens of both countries to travel freely within a 16-kilometer radius of the border for up to 72 hours without the need for a visa. This initiative aims to preserve traditional ties and alleviate insecurity for tribal communities residing along the border.

 The FMR spans 1,629.5 kilometers of unfenced border shared between four Indian states - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram - and Myanmar. In January 2018, the Union Cabinet approved a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance economic interactions through this regime.

 However, concerns have been raised regarding the regime's misuse. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, militants and criminals are exploiting the FMR to smuggle weapons, narcotics, and counterfeit currency, taking advantage of the regime's leniencies to cross borders and evade capture.

****_b) Enhancing Security and Mobility :_

 To address the existing challenges, a high-level committee chaired by the Special Secretary (Internal Security) was constituted in August 2017. The committee's terms of reference encompass the development of standardized operating procedures and guidelines for the Free Movement Regime (FMR), delineation of roles and responsibilities for central and state agencies, and the creation of a uniform Border Pass system.

 This secure pass will facilitate regulated movement within the 16-kilometer border area, with stringent controls to prevent misuse. Furthermore, the committee plans to introduce biometric cards for local residents and implement measures to prevent unauthorized vehicle crossings. These enhanced security protocols aim to strike a balance between the benefits of the FMR and the need to safeguard the interests of both nations and their border communities.

 Mizoram shares a 510-kilometer-long border with Myanmar, which remains unfenced and porous. Six districts in the state adjoin the international border, with Champhai district sharing the longest border with Myanmar.

_c) Border Fencing and Free Movement Regime Abolition :_

 On February 28, 2024, the Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Indian government’s proposal to build a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and to abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR). Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution expresses concerns that these measures would negatively impact the Zo ethnic communities, which have been historically divided by the border established during British colonial rule. The Assembly contends that strengthening this division with additional barriers would disturb the livelihoods and social connections of the border communities.

_d) FMR New Guidelines (Free Movement Limit On Indo-Myanmar Border Tightened to 10 Km, With Border Pass) :_

 The Indian government has introduced new regulations to oversee movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). On December 24, 2024, the MHA announced a revised protocol that decreases the Free Movement Regime (FMR) range, shrinking it from 16 km to 10 km. Despite Union Home Minister Amit Shah's earlier statement in February of the previous year, suggesting the FMR would be abolished, a formal notification has yet to be issued.

 Security along the 510-km border has been intensified, and now residents residing within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border must secure a Border Pass for travel. This Border Pass permits a stay of up to seven days and is provided to both Indian and Myanmar citizens who present documentation verifying their residency within the 10-km zone. Effective from December 31, enforcement is executed by State Police, Assam Rifles, and Health Officials at major entry and exit points. Individuals crossing the border will undergo document scrutiny by the Assam Rifles, followed by security and health evaluations by local authorities. The Assam Rifles will record biometrics and issue a Border Pass featuring a QR code and photograph. Non-compliance with the new movement regulations will lead to legal repercussions, with physical verifications in place to ensure adherence. The crossing points will be operational from Monday to Saturday, between 6:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.

 The new regulations restrict the movement of individuals from 16 km under the previous FMR to 10 km now, on either side. Only those residing in the "border area"—defined as within 10 km on either side—are eligible to apply for the "Border Pass" for up to a seven-day stay; such pass-holders are required to return it at the same crossing point where it was issued. Residents of villages beyond the "border areas" (the 10-km zone) and citizens of any third country are ineligible for the Border Pass.

A border pass will be issued to only one adult, and minors (under 18 years of age) must be accompanied by a parent. The details for up to three children can be included in a single border pass belonging to either parent; a separate border pass is required for more than three minors.

Proof of identity can be provided by the station house officer of the local police station or a person of equivalent rank in Myanmar, as well as by a local village chief or village authority, certifying that the applicant resides in the village situated within the 10-kilometer "border area" on either side. This proof of identity document is valid for one year. These new guidelines will takes effect from 30.12.2024, at Zokhawthar and Hnahlan, located in champhai District, along the Mizoram-Myanmar border and till date the number of person entered Mynamar to India is 1452 and India to Myanmar is 16 at Zokhawthar, person entered into Myanmar to India is 16 and India to Myanmar is 11 at Hnahlan. The Zokhawthar and Hnahlan is pilot site for new entry and Exit point.

**PHASE-I**

 PHASE-I of Entry and Exit point along with Indo-Myanmar Border in Mizoram is supposed to start from 31.12.2024 in these places:-

| S/No | District | Name of Crossing Points | Closest BP | Closest COB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Lawngtlai | Zochachhuah | BP-09 | COB Zorinpui/20 AR |
| 2 | Lawngtlai | Hruitezawl | BP-08 | COB Zorinpui/20 AR |
| 3 | Lawngtlai | Laitlang | BP-08 | COB Zorinpui/20AR |


But the identified check gates in each of these areas is deemed too far from the villages and a meeting on 21.01.2025 at 05:15 pm held under the chairmanship of Secretary(BM), MHA on the entry/Exit points along Indo-Myanmar Border(IBM) devoted that it must be verified by Assam Rifle and YLA and at the time of entry the report No concrete action has taken place.

PHASE-II :- In the below mention places check gates of Entry and Exit point will be implemented in the course of time.

1. **Surrendering of Myanmar Army**:

******Intensified military operations conducted by armed ethnic groups in Myanmar's Chin State and Rakhine State led to a significant surrender of Myanmar Army personnel to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles from late 2023 onwards.**

In November and December 2023, a total of 255 Myanmar Army personnel surrendered in Mizoram's Champhai, Siaha, and Lawngtlai districts. This was followed by another 380 personnel surrendering in January 2024 within Lawngtlai and Siaha districts. Initially, Assam Rifles airlifted the surrendered personnel back to Myanmar via helicopter. Later, they were evacuated by Myanmar military aircraft from Lengpui Airport. However, on January 23, 2024, a Myanmar aircraft scheduled to evacuate the remaining 92 personnel crash-landed at Lengpui Airport, injuring six crew members on board.

 Fortunately, there were no serious injuries or casualties. The last batch of surrendered personnel was eventually evacuated by two Myanmar Air Force special flights on January 24, 2024. Till date (i.e. 07.01.2025), a total of 635 Myanmar Army personnel had surrendered to Mizoram Police and Indian security personnel in Mizoram.

**5.**  **Biometric enrolment of refugees:**

The Mizoram government has decided to collect biometric data from Myanmar and Bangladesh refugees, but with the condition that they won't be deported until peace is restored in their home countries. The state's Home department has reached out to the Union Ministry to modify the Foreigner's Identification Portal (FIP) to accommodate these refugees.

Currently, the FIP is designed to track and deport illegal immigrants. The state is awaiting a response from the Centre regarding this request. In the meantime, the Centre has extended the biometric enrollment deadline to December 2024. The Union Home Minister has also assured the Chief Minister that the refugees won't be deported until peace prevails in their respective countries. It's worth noting that the biometric data collection process has been delayed due to ongoing discussions with the Centre.

**C. Manipur IDPs**:

1. Brief history :

The violent unrest that broke out on May 3, 2023, in Churachandpur District, Manipur, was sparked by the "Tribal Solidarity March" organized by the All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM). The march was a protest against the proposed reservation for the majority Meitei community. Unfortunately, the unrest escalated into a year-long ethnic conflict between the tribal communities and the Meitei community, marked by armed clashes, destruction of property, and loss of life.

The prolonged conflict resulted in a significant influx of displaced persons seeking refuge in Mizoram, fleeing the violence and instability in their home state.

**D. Issue related with Bangladesh :**

1. **Influx of Refugee :**

_a) Brief history -_

 A military operation launched by the Bangladesh Army against the Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) on November 15, 2022, in Chhaihkhiang Village, Bangladesh, triggered a mass exodus of civilians, primarily from the Bawm community. During this initial influx, 272 civilians, including women and children, fled their villages and sought refuge in Mizoram. Subsequent military operations led to three significant waves of Bawm civilians entering Mizoram's Lawngtlai District. However, the influx briefly subsided during Bangladesh's election process in January 2024 and the peace talks between the KNA and the Bangladesh government.

The situation escalated again on April 2-3, 2024, when the KNA looted banks and seized arms, prompting an intensified operation against the group. This led to further influxes of Bawm refugees into Mizoram.

The most recent influx occurred on July 4, 2024, when 93 Bawm refugees entered Damdep-II Village in Lawngtlai District. BSF personnel attempted to deport them to Crocodile Camp, Kamtuli, but the State Government intervened, ensuring the safe transportation of the 93 refugees, along with an additional 33 refugees, to Chamdur Village on July 8, 2024.

1. **Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing** :

 The Indo-Bangladesh border, stretching approximately 4,096 kilometers, is one of the longest international boundaries globally. To enhance security and regulate migration, a comprehensive fencing project has been undertaken along this extensive border.

 Significant progress has been made, with over 90% of the fencing installation completed. High-priority areas prone to illegal crossings have been addressed, although some sections remain incomplete or require maintenance due to challenging terrain.

 The fencing infrastructure primarily comprises barbed wire, augmented by floodlights and advanced surveillance systems to ensure effective border management and monitoring.

**E.********Arecanut Smuggling****:**

 The smuggling of illicit arecanuts through Mizoram has been a persistent issue since 2016, primarily driven by attempts to evade the high taxes imposed on arecanut imports by the Government of India. As of December 31, 2024, Mizoram Police have seized approximately 3,367,830 kilograms of arecanuts, valued at â‚¹53,91,91,750. The seized goods were subsequently handed over to the Customs Department and relevant District Collectors for further legal action or disposal.

 In response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by social activist Pi Vanramchhuangi (Ruatfela Nu) on April 29, 2024, the Aizawl Bench of the Hon'ble Gauhati High Court issued an order on July 16, 2024, directing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the smuggling of arecanuts into Mizoram

**H. Mizoram-Assam Boundary Dispute :**

**1. Historical Background:**

 The Mizoram-Assam border, as delineated by the Government of India Act of 1935, stretches for 164.6 kilometers. Historically, the two states have been embroiled in a longstanding dispute over the precise demarcation of this boundary. Mizoram contends that the boundary should be based on the 1875 demarcation, as marked by the British-era Inner Line Reserve Forest. In contrast, Assam maintains that its constitutional boundary is defined by a 1933 Survey of India map.

**2. Source of the Dispute:**

 The core issue driving the dispute is the divergent interpretation of the border's demarcation. Mizoram advocates for the Inner Line Reserve Forest as the boundary, whereas Assam upholds the 1933 map as the authoritative definition of its border. This fundamental disagreement has precipitated a series of confrontations and skirmishes over the years, perpetuating tensions between the two states.

**3. Recent Events:**

  The conflict has intensified with significant incidents:

  1. February 27, 2018: The Mizoram Zirlai Pawl (MZP) constructed a rest house at Bairabi Zophai, which was subsequently demolished by Assam Police and Forest Officials, who claimed it was within Assam’s territory.

**I**. **Insurgency in Mizoram:**

**Hmar People's Convention (Democratic) and its Related Issues:**

 The Hmar People's Convention (Democratic) [HPC(D)] was founded in 1996, with Lalhmingthanga Sanate from Khawlian, Mizoram, as its president. However, in September 2011, after 15 years in leadership, he was impeached by the HPC(D) council for allegedly forming an agreement with the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) in Manipur. Subsequently, H. Zosangbera was appointed as the new chairman of HPC(D). This impeachment resulted in a division within the HPC(D) into two factions: one led by H. Zosangbera and the other by Lalhmingthanga Sanate.

 After engaging in discussions with the Government of Mizoram, H. Zosangbera’s faction surfaced publicly during the Arms Surrender Ceremony at CTI, Sesawng on April 13, 2018. Meanwhile, Lalhmingthanga Sanate's faction was inactive for a period but has recently resurfaced.

**Recent Activities of HPC(D):**

  Since the end of 2022, Lalhmingthanga Sanate of the HPC(D) has issued demand letters to numerous Village Councils within the HPC(D) demand areas (Aizawl, Kolasib, and Saitual Districts). In May and June 2023, additional demand letters were sent via WhatsApp, threatening Village Council leaders to comply or face consequences.

 

 On December 24, 2022, Lalhmingthanga Sanate (53), the son of V.L. Ramliana and President of HPC(D), was apprehended by personnel from the Assam Rifles and Assam Police in Cachar, Assam. At the time, he possessed a .32 pistol and 48 live rounds of ammunition. He was released on bail from judicial custody on May 15, 2023.  

 As long as Lalhmingthanga Sanate's armed group can freely move across Mizoram, Manipur, and Assam, they are likely to grow stronger by recruiting more volunteers. Furthermore, the possibility remains that some of the surrendered members from H. Zosangbera’s faction might join them.

Mizoram itself experiences low-level insurgencies in its northeastern and northwestern regions. However, on April 2, 2018, the Government of Mizoram and the Hmar People's Convention (Democratic), HPC(D), an insurgent group from the north, signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS). This agreement marked the end of over two decades of armed insurgency by the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony took place on April 12, 2018, during which approximately 102 cadres and 12 council members of the HPC(D) came forward. However, the other faction of the HPC(D), led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate, has begun resurfacing and reorganizing. Throughout 2022 and 2023, they have been involved in collecting donations and extorting funds.

**Cases registered against HPCD, Lalhmingthanga Sanate Faction (during 2022 to 2024) :**

1. No. of case registered –  31
2. No. of persons arrested  –  09
3. No. of Case disposed – 12
4. Pending Investigation – 19

**J. Conclusion :**

The security situation in Mizoram is crucial due to its geographical position, sharing borders with two countries facing significant internal challenges and insurgent activity. This strategic location not only poses direct security threats but also serves as a potential route for smuggling activities. With these factors in play, Mizoram's security is intrinsically linked to the broader security framework of India.

The presence of insurgent groups in neighboring regions necessitates vigilant border management and robust security measures to prevent any spillover into Mizoram. Smuggling, including drugs, weapons, and other illicit goods, further complicates the security landscape, requiring constant monitoring and collaboration between state and federal agencies.

For Mizoram, maintaining an uncompromising security stance is non-negotiable. Security personnel and agencies must remain constantly vigilant, ensuring a state of readiness to respond to any emerging threats swiftly and effectively. Any lapse in this vigilance could have broader implications for national security, given Mizoram's strategic importance.

Collaboration between law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and local communities is essential to enhancing security measures. This collaborative approach can help in effectively countering insurgent infiltration and curbing smuggling activities, thereby ensuring peace and stability in the region.

In essence, the security of Mizoram is synonymous with the security of India. All concerned agencies must remain on high alert, continually strengthening security protocols to protect this critical region and, consequently, the entire nation. This ongoing commitment is vital for ensuring lasting security and stability.****
