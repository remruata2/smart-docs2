****Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP)****

**The**Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project**is a project that will connect the eastern Indian seaport ofKolkatawithSittweseaport inRakhine State, Myanmar by sea. In Myanmar, it will then link Sittwe seaport toPaletwa,Chin Statevia theKaladan riverboat route, and then from Paletwa by road toMizoramstate in Northeast India. Originally, the project was scheduled to be completed by 2014 but it has not been completed till today.**

****Route****

The project has several sections combining multi-modes of transport:

1. 539km shipping route from seaport ofKolkatainIndiatoSittweseaport inMyanmarviaBay of Bengal. This sea route has been operational for several decades.
2. 158km river boat route fromSittweseaport to Inland Water Terminal (IWT) atPaletwaJetty viaKaladan riverinMyanmar, (June 2017)
3. 110km road route from IWTPaletwato Indo-Myanmar border inMyanmar. Construction contract awarded in June 2017.
4. 90km route from Indo-Myanmar border at Zorinpui to Aizawl-Saiha National Highway atLawngtlaiDistrict, MizoraminIndiaby road onNational Highway 54 (India)(NH-54), which then continues further toDabakain Assamvia 850km long NH-54 which in turn is part of the largerEast-West CorridorconnectingNorth East Indiawith the rest ofIndia.

****History****

This project will reduce distance fromKolkatatoSittweeby approximately 1328km and will reduce the need to transport good through the narrowSiliguricorridor, also known asChicken's Neck.

 InitiallyIndiahad tried to persuadeBangladeshto offer transport and transit rights to the north eastern states. However,Bangladeshhas consistently refused to grant such rights, including access to itsChittagong port, which is less than 200km away fromAgartala, the capital ofTripura.

 The project is being piloted and funded by theMinistry of External Affairs (India). The preliminary feasibility studies were carried out byRail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES). Construction work onSittwe port and the boat jetty inPaletwa, as well as the dredging work, will be executed by theInland Waterways Authority of India(IWAI), with Essar Projects Ltd, a division of theEssar Groupappointed in May 2010 as the main contractor.

 Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project initially faced problems such as underestimation of the road length inMyanmarand plans to construct hydro-electric projects —Chhimtuipui RiverandLungleng River— on two tributaries of theKaladan Riverfollowed by another project downstream. That the first two projects are being built by one public sector undertaking and the third is being constructed by another PSU (Public Sector Unit) has also led to coordination issues. Due to construction of this hydro electrical project, Navigation of boats could be effected.

 The project includes a waterway component of 158km on Kaladan River from Sittwe to Paletwa in Myanmar and a road component of 109km from Paletwa to Zorinpui along the India-Myanmar border in Mizoram.

****Development****

On 19th April 2016, Indian MinisterGeneral VK Singhinformed that 66% of the new 2-lane-per-direction 12-meter-wide 99.83kmNational Highway 502A(NH502A) starting from NH-54 at Lawngtlai to Zorinpui in Mizoram on Indian side is done and will be completed by June 2018. Other aspects of the project including the port, waterways and 109km Zorinpui on the India-Myanmar border to Paletwa will be completed by April 2019. Mr Lalrinngheta, a Project Site Engineer on the India side, also reported the work is ongoing.

 In April 2017, India handed over the operation of completed Sittwe port and Inland Water Terminal at Paletwa to Myanmar. In June 2017, India handed six gas tanker cargo vessels worth US$81.29 million (K110.08 billion) to the Myanmar government to transport gas to north-east India viaManipur. Work on the port in Sittwe and the IWT in Paletwa, Chin State, is in its final stages, and the six cargo vessels are meant to facilitate transportation of goods from Sittwe to Paletwa. The $81.29 million cost of the vessels was met through a grant from India. The construction work was assigned to IWT in October 2012, the keels were laid in March 2013 and the vessels were launched between April and December 2016. On completion of the tests and trials at Yangon, the vessels reached Sittwe in March 2017. Acceptance trials were completed in April 2017 in Sittwe.
