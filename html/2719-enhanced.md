Sir,

 In inviting to your letter cited above regarding an explosion incident at an automobile Workshop on 18.03.2022, I am to state that one of the deceased Lalthafamkima @Papuia (48) h/o Pardingliani of Thuampui, Aizawl was however known to be as a habitual smuggler who indulged in smuggling, transporting and delivering narcotic drugs and arms/explosives, from one end to the other. He had been kept under constant surveillance but no clue or clear information could be attained till the date of the said incident, which may lead to his arrest. It is also learnt that a false chamber was created on his vehicle B/R No. MZ01-S-5983 and the same was reportedly used it for hiding and transporting illegal substances.
