Subj.: Detail Report of Explosion on July, 2017.

Sir,

 With reference to the Intelligence Bureau letter No. 17/VS/2017(8-9)-1321-1398 - VIP Security Intelligence Digest No. 08-09/2017 and the subject mentioned above, I am sending the details of explosion in July, 2017 as below:

 Information was received from Khawlrosiama, VCP Hnahlan village that on 6.7.2017 @ 2:40 pm, villagers heard a loud blasting sound at the outskirt of Hnahlan village near river Tiau. In response to this, DSB staff of Champhai Police and Assam Rifles personnel went to the place of occurrence to verify the area which was about 2.5 kms from Hnahlan village .Close examination of the spot was conducted on 7.7.2017 where a hole, about one square-foot wide and about half foot deep was found. Few pieces of metal and cloths were also collected from the P.O which were sent to FSL for examination. The matter was kept under enquiry and it was assumed that the cause of the explosion(strongly presumed as Gelatine sticks) was accidental one, blasted by some local persons. Fortunately, there was no human casualty as a result of the blast and no case was registered at the Police Station.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
