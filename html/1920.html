The said information contained that some unidentified persons were illegally possessing and trying to sell some unidentified weapons/firearms and that two BFS&rsquo;s sources were already engaged to snare the illegal possessor for apprehension and seizure. It may be noted that the said party (BSF and DSB) further requested CID(SB) to join the operation party which was accepted by the latter after the matter was thoroughly discussed by senior officers of CID(SB). </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">A joint operation party was then formed on the same day and as engagement with the illegal possessor was already made by BSF sources, no new strategy was planned. On the same day, the joint operation team were trying to locate and apprehend the illegal possessor but to no success. On the next day i.e. dt. 12.3.2012, the operation was continued since morning time. On the said day, the mentioned two civilian sources were trying to lure out the illegal possessor which was identified as Peka of unknown residence, the sources disguise themselves as an Arms buyer who are looking for arms to buy. They were also secretly followed and watched by the operation team. As the suspect (illegal possessor) was a very clever fellow, he kept on changing places where he and the sources will meet to discuss business. From the sources it was also known that the suspect&rsquo;s was called Peka but by that time his residence was not yet known. As the suspect often suddenly switching places where he will meet the sources, the joint operation party failed to locate/intervene while the sources meet the suspect but the place where the suspect took the sources was later on revealed by the sources through phone call. The sources also said that they have seen the arms which the suspect person tried to sell and also that they examine it thoroughly. They also stated that the arms were reportedly kept inside the shop where they suspect brought them as they saw him again (after the meeting) going out from the shop empty handed. On receiving the said information, the joint operation team immediately proceeded towards the said shop which is located at Ramhlun road, Chanmari. On reaching the shop, the co-owner of the shop Mr. Eddie told the operation team that the suspect had left the shop a few minutes then. The owner of the shop Mr. Noela who is also an older brother of Mr. Eddiea had also ccme in after awhile and when the two brothers were questioned they said that one of their distant friends came to the shop that day and that one of them had kept his bag at one corner of the shop. On hearing the information, the operation team called on civilian witness Pu Lalsawmliana of Chanmari and in his presence Mr. Eddie-a, took out the bag from one corner of the shop as demanded. When he opened the bag two small arms (9mm pistol and .38 Revolver) were found inside the bag. The recovered articles were seized in the presence of the mentioned civilian witness. At the time of making seizure, statements of witness, accused and seizing officer were recorded. The brother claimed that they did not know the content of the bag and that they were not their property. They further mentioned that they would be able to help the operation party in arresting the real owner of the bag by insisting him (the owner of the bag) to come to their shop to take his bag. Since the information obtained by the operation party also confirmed that the brothers were not the owner of the arms and that they were not the one who was selling the arms, attempt was continued to be made to lure the suspect into the shop. Mr. Noela called the owner and demanded him to take away his bag from their shop. Soon after, the owner of the bag came to the shop and he was immediately apprehended by the operation team. In the presence of civilian witness, the bag&rsquo;s owner was asked to take out his bag from&nbsp; the place where he hid it. As demanded, he opened the bag and took out two small arms which he had tried to sell earlier that day. The owner of the bag (the accused) also admitted that the bag and its content were his property and that he was the one who kept/hid the bag inside the shop. Upon hearing the accused confession, the accused was apprehended. The accused and the seized articles were then brought to Aizawl P/S and handed them over to O/C of Aizawl P/S along with a written FIR. The accused was also formally arrested by the case I/O at the P/S. </span></span></span></span></p>

All the seized articles were also brought and produced to the P/S along with the accused.</span></span></span></span></p>

It was certain that the accused was the owner of the arms and that he was the one who put them inside the bag which he hid in one corner of Mr. Noela&rsquo;s shop. Had he not been the owner of the bag, he would not have came to the shop to collect his property when Mr. Noela asked him through phone call to come to their shop to take away his bag. Moreover, the accused was plainly asked to take out the bag he hid from where he hide i.e. without telling or giving him any hint where the bag was, he immediately walked to one corner of the house and took out the bag. It is very clear that had he himslef not hide the bag, he would not have known where the bag was.</span></span></span></span></p>

The owner of the shop Mr. Noela also came inside the shop after awhile and when the two brothers were questioned they said that one of their distant friends came to the shop that day and that one of them had kept his back at one corner of the shop. On hearing the information, the operation team called on civilian witnessess but only one witness Pu Lalsawmliana of Chanmari could turnup and in his presnce Mr. Eddiea, took out the bag from one corner of the shop as demanded. When he opened the bag two small arms were found inside the bag. The recovered articles were seized in the presence of the mentioned civilian witness. At the time of seizing, witness&rsquo;s statement, accused statement and seizing officer&rsquo;s statement were also recorded. At the time of seizing, witness&rsquo;s statement, accused statement and seizing officer&rsquo;s statement were also recorded.

There are certain limitations of power for some unit like CID(SB) etc., as in the said cases also, only, the operation, apprehension, seizing, recording statement of accused/seizure witness/seizing officer, lodging F.I.R could be carried out, and after the accused and seized articles were handed over to O/C of a P/S, the case was taken up by the concerned P/S staff for further investigation and also to conclude the case. It is not the duty of seizing officer of CID(SB) unit to submit the chargesheet or to further call other witness. However, in this particular case, the mentioned shop owners who present at time of seizing Mr. Noela and his brother Mr. Eddie were called to present themselves for questioning several times at CID (SB) office at Bungkawn. On that occasions also, no direct involvement was not seen from the brother&rsquo;s side, they themselves also accepted to appear before the court to confess the truth as it was (i.e. against the accused Vanlalpeka) if needed. The case I/O was also hinted to include the brother as prsecution witnessess. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">10. At the time and place of seizing, the accused clearly admitted that he was the owner of the arms and that he did not have a licenses and also that he was the one who brought the arms inside the shop and hid it. He also affirmed that he was trying to sell the arms to anyone who want to buy it. It was known that confession before police even in the present of civilian witness is not acceptable in the court, but the situation and all the chain of events did proves the accused was telling the truth. Beside, the operation party strongly believed that the real owner of the arms and the arms he was selling were apprehended and recovered because the suspect Vanlalpeka was previously trying to sell to the operation party&rsquo;s sources, he even let the source&rsquo;s examined the arms. </span></span></span></span></p>

At the time and place of occurance, though the arms were kept/hid and seized inside Mr. Noela&rsquo;s shop, it was clear that Mr. Noela and his brother Mr, Eddiea did not actually knew the content of the bag and that the arms were not their property, because if the arms were not the accused property, he will never came to collect the arms from Mr. Noela&rsquo;s shop when Mr. Noela called him through phone while witness&rsquo;s was also present and insisted him to take away his bag from his shop without telling or hinting him where it was. Then, the accused came into the shop and when plainly asked to take out the bag, he did so without any problems of finding it. Due to the said matter, since no direct involvement was not seen from Mr. Noela and Mr. Eddiea, they were not apprehended at first instance, but they were informed that they must not leave Aizawl and must always be ready to be questioned later on. But, after the case was taken up by the case I/O, it was his decision to call on the brother and question them and also to whether include the said brother for prosecution witnesses or not. </span></span></span></span></p>

Upon hearing the accused confession, the accused was apprehended and the recovered articles were also seized in the presence of the mentioned civilian witness. It has to be noted that, the said witness did not took or record any photoghraphs or vedios of the accused or the event, it can be assume that after such a long time of case trailing, the witness&rsquo;s memory might have became vague about the event which unabled him to clearly identify the accused as well as the seized articles when they were presented befor him in the court.</span></span></span></span></p>

As stated above gist of the event was as described as before, when the operation party reached Mr. Noela&rsquo;s shop, the co-owner of the shop Mr. Eddiea who is the younger brother of Mr. Noela told that the person (the suspect) whom the operation party wanted to see had left the shop a few minutes before the operation team arrived.

At first, after the witness arrive the place of occurance, Mr. Eddiea took out the bag and opened in which the two small arms were found and he closed the bag and put it back where it was kept before i.e. after seizure was made. The bag was later on taken out by the accused Vanlalpeka as demanded in the presence of said civilian witness. It could be that, the civilian witness might have not remembered it correctly about the person who firstly took out the bag. </span></span></span></span></p>

It was unfortunate that the case I/O was transferred during the investigation. The second I/O to whom the case was endorsed might have some difficulties in continuing conduction of further investigation that he might not have deep knowledge about the case and also that he might have missed the necessity to include Mr. Noela and Mr. Eddiea as prosecution witnesses.</span></span></span></span></p>

The case was taken up by two I/Os. Because the first I/O was transferred before he concluded the case and it was later on endorsed to other I/O to conduct further investigation. It was the second I/O who conducted post seizing investigation and concluded the case by submitting chargesheet to the court.</span></span></span></span></p>

The case I/O was also hinted to include the brother as prsecution witnessess. Since, the CID(SB) personnel were not empowered to take up cases. After the case was filed, further and deeper investigation was endorsed to the case I/O of the concerned P.S. It is wholly the decision of the I/O whether to include the said brother as prosecution witnesses or not.</span></span></span></span></p>
