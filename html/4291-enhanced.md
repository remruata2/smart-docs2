**A. INTERNAL SECURITY SCHEME OF MIZORAM**

1. **Internal security situation in Mizoram**

 Mizoram (“Land of the Mizos”) was known as the Lushai Hills District of Assam before it was renamed the Mizo Hills District in 1954. In 1972 it became a centrally administered union territory under the name of Mizoram, and in 1987 it achieved statehood. It has an area of 8,139 square miles (21,081 square km) and a population of 1,091,014as per 2011 census.

Mizoram State although being one of the most peaceful State in the country is sandwiched between two foreign countries(i.e. Myanmar and Bangladesh) and also militant infested States like Manipur, Assam and Tripura are its immediate neighbours which calls for extra alertness in all its border areas.

Mizoram has 496.531 kms long international border with Myanmar and 319.791 kms with Bangladesh. The international border is somewhat porous and is sometimes taken advantage of by various insurgent groups for arms smuggling and also for transit of the militant group themselves. Border Security Force as well as Assam Rifles personnel could not fully cover the whole border areas and hence intelligence network and State Police force needs to be strengthened so as to assist para-military forces posted in the border areas to check free movement of undesirable elements and also to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the Indian soil.While the Border Security Force guards the Bangladesh border, the border with Myanmar is guarded by the Assam Rifles.

 Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where around 102 (one hundred two) Cadres and 12 (twelve) Council Members of HPC(D) came to over ground at the ceremony. However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by LalhmingthangaSanate have started resurfacing and planning to reorganise themselves which could, in due course of time, pose security problems especially in the northern most and north eastern parts of Mizoram.

 As for the North-Western region, the Bru insurgency has been contained to a great extend so much so that this insurgent Group has become more or less a group of Bandits without any specific demands or objectives. Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF) which was formed in 1997 signed Peace Accord with Govt.of Mizoram on 26.4.2005 and surrendered to the Government on 25.7.2005 and 195 (one hundred ninety five) Cadres came over ground along with 9 (nine)weapons. Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram(BLFM) surrendered to the Government on 26.10.2006. About 804 (eight hundred four) Cadres came over ground with 66 weapons and 45 ammunitions.

 In fact in the strife-torn North East India, It is commendable of being the least militant infected State and it is mainly due to the swift action of Mizoram Police in nabbing militancy in its early stage.

 Security of Mizoram is entrusted mainly with Mizoram Police with sister agencies viz. Assam Rifles, Border Security Force and Central Reserve Police Force. Mizoram Police deployed Mizoram Armed Police (MAP)/Indian Reserve Battalionmainly along interstate borders by setting up Border OutPosts (BOPs). 3 (three) Battalions of Assam Rifles(AR) manned the Indo-Myanmar border in the East and South while 3 (three) Battalions of Border Security Force(BSF) manned the Western border with limited man-power which leaves many areas vulnerable to infiltration. The porous international borders served as a possible route for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, trafficking of human etc. across the borders of Mizoram. Influx of illegal foreigners from Bangladesh and Myanmar into Mizoram could also create deeper problems.

 Besides, the above noted armed groups operating from across the inter-state boundary which had been more or less contained, there are other insurgent outfit like the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT), National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak Muivah (NSCN) (IM), Arakan Liberation Party (ALP) having base camp across the international border neighbouring Mizoram. Movement of this militant have been closely watched and have never posed major threat to the internal security in Mizoram except few kidnapping cases in the border areas of Mizoram-Tripura-Bangladesh.

 It is often said that the above noted militants and other militants of the North East are using Mizoram for trafficking of arms consignment. Many instances of seizure of some arms and contraband items within the state during the past years indicate use of the state as a trafficking route of the contraband items. However, it could also boldly be said that arms trafficking has been successfully checked during the last two years.

 The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful. Although, Mizoram is surrounded by countries and states which are having many disturbances with respect to insurgency and terrorism.

1. **External security situation in Mizoram**

 The long porous international border could be a security threat to the state. There have been many instances of Arakan Army(AA) presence/activities along Mizoram-Myanmar border in the past years. TheArakan ArmyisaRakhine InsurgentGroup inMyanmar, founded on the 10th April 2009.It is the armed wing of theUnited League of Arakan(ULA). The purpose of the AA is to protect Arakan people and to establish peace, justice, freedom and development. They often exchanged fire along the border and illegally entered into Mizoram territory.

In recent year, it has been reported that******over 2,70,000 (two lakhs seventy thousand) Rohingyas refugees entered Bangladesh through border points of Chittagong Division (Bandarban, Rangamati&Khagrachhari Cox Bazar, etc.) in recent year. As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division, further infiltration of illegal migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.**

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Due to its long porous international border with Myanmar and Bangladesh, unlawful influx of foreigners and large scale smuggling of drugs and various contraband into the state through the porous borders has remained a serious concern for several decades.

****It is necessary to explore the possibilities to tackle and check on growing influx of illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh and Myanmar.

1. **Measures to counter terrorism and internal security threat within the state:**

Mizoram experiences low level of insurgency and internal security threat after the signing of Mizoram Peace Accord 1986. A decade long insurgency in the north eastern part of Mizoram also came to an end after the signing of memorandum of settlement (MOS) signed by the Mizoram Government and HPC(D) in Aizawl on April 2, 2018 and 104 HPC(D)Cadres laid down 45 weapons, including 4 sniper rifles, 1 grenade launcher, 9 AK assault rifles, 1 M-16 carbine assault rifle and 13 double barrel guns. They also surrendered 2,892 rounds ofammunition, launcher shells and five radio sets.A secessionist movement at the western part of the state also came to an end after the signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between BNLF and Govt. of Mizoram on 26.4.2005. However, due to its strategic location it cannot be rule out the possible terrorism or insurgency related activities within the state and it is imperative to deviseproper measures to counter the internal security threat and the following measures can be taken in this regard:

1. **Intelligence sharing and co-ordination for combating terrorism/insurgency****:**

A robust mechanism for intelligence sharing among the various States and Central agencies is in place in the country. The coordination mechanism for intelligence sharing at state–level that presently exist in Mizoram is highlighted as under:

**(a) Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC):**

Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC) was set up in Mizoram Police in May, 2011. It is one of the Centers amongst various Intelligence Agencies under Ministry of Home Affairs for effective sharing of intelligence input/report with other Central and State Agencies. Regular SMAC meetings of Nodal Officers of the State police, security forces, paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies deployed within the State of Mizoram are being conducted regularly at SIB Hqrs., Aizawl. During such meetings, intelligence inputs are shared and discussed with responders/State Police and various Law Enforcement Agencies for necessary follow up action.

In addition to SMAC Meeting, Intelligence inputs are being shared with various intelligence agencies all over India through Multi Agency Centre (MAC) Threat Management System.

**(b) Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA) Coordination/ Directional Meeting:**

Assam Rifle and Border Security Force (BSF) have regularly conducted LIA Coordination Meeting in Aizawl. LIA Directional Meeting is also regularly conducted by BSF in Silchar, Assam. During such meetings, intelligence inputs are shared and discussed with responders/State Police and various Law Enforcement Agencies for necessary follow up action. The LIA Coordination meeting is held under the chairmanship of DIG, 23rd Assam Rifle if LIA is conducted by Assam Rifle and DIG, Sector HQ BSF presided over the meeting if it was conducted by BSF.

SMAC and LIA meeting should be used as an instrument for intelligence sharing and close coordination among various intelligence agencies within the state. Any short coming or defect in respect of timely intelligence sharing on each agency should be rectified at the earliest.

(c) The State Special Branch shall maintain a data bank of list of surrendered militants, convicted, release and active within the state and it should also closely monitor activities of militant in the neighboring Countries and States. They should also closely monitor the surrendered and release militants and persons having link with militant and their relative within the state, and persons having previous conviction in smuggling of Arms and contraband items.

1. **Strengthening of the State Police:**

 The police are the first responders in the event of any terrorist attack or violence, and they are also the backbone of our intelligence, investigation and anti-corruption agencies. Thus, from the point of any angle - the security of the common man, the survival of democracy, maintaining the trajectory of economic progress or dealing with the major threats confronting the country, it is necessary to reform, develop and revitalize police force.

There have been a number of commissions, both at the State and Central level - State Police Commissions, National Police Commission, Gore Committee, Ribeiro Committee, Padmanabhaiah Committee, Malimath Committee, to name only a few - which made recommendations for reforms, but received no more than cosmetic treatment at the hands of the government.

It is imperative to strengthen the manpower of Mizoram Police by filling up vacant posts by way of fresh recruitment at various ranks and files. Strengthening of Police infrastructure such technological capabilities, mobility etc. should be given top priority especially in the border and minority dominated areas in the western and southern part of the state.

1. **Setting up of Internal Security Division:**

Many states in the country are having a separate Internal Security Division and considering the strategic location of the state, it is imperative to set up a separate Internal Security Division in the State. The state has border with militant infested Countries viz. Bangladesh and Myanmar, and States viz. Manipur, Tripura and Assam and there have been many instances of seizure of Arms, smuggle items viz. Arms, Drugs etc. and report has been received on many occasions regarding use of the state as transit by various militant groups. Further, the crime situation in the state is dynamic due to advancement of technology. Since recent years, various crimes are committed using sophisticated and advance technology, and secessionist movement or anti-national movement can easily be propagated with the help of social media, encrypted text etc.Due to this, it is suggested to create a separate Internal Security Division under the Policewith an objective to collect Actionable Intelligence and to carry out operations. To collect intelligence having a bearing on Anti-National and Subversive Activities like Terrorist Activity, Narco Terrorism, Organized Crimes, having an internal security dimension. This specialized unit will complement the jurisdiction of the local police.

1. **Identification of the Institution and Structures required for efficient anti-terrorism mechanism-deficiencies in the existing institutions:**

As the state has border with militant infested Countries and States, and is conduit for smuggling of Arms, Contraband items and trafficking of human, transit of militant, the following measures can be adopted:

1. _Setting Up of Elite Counter Insurgency &Anti-TerroristUnit :_

A specialize counter insurgency &amp; anti-terrorist unit may be set up to deal with any insurgency &amp; anti-terrorist attack etc. This will provide training to all police personnel of the State on counter insurgency &amp; jungle warfare with a view to tackle effectively the menace of insurgency and terrorism.

_(ii) Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS_):

ATS may be created in each battalion by Government of Mizoram to counter the menace of terrorism in Mizoram. The ATS teams will be selected from highly trained personnel from Mizoram Police and must have a thorough knowledge of department policies and procedures. They will be trained to deploy against threats ofterrorism, for crowd control, etc.

The ATS will be equipped with specialized firearms includingsubmachine guns,assault rifles,sniper rifles, riot control agents, etc. The ATS will be provided with specialized equipment like heavy body armour, ballistic shields, armoured vehicles, advanced night vision optics, etc.

_(iii)Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School____(CIJW) in____Vairengte__,____Mizoram__:_

CIJW School, Vairengte is consideredas one of world's most prestigious anti-terrorist training institution. CIJW School is having trainees from several countries receiving counter insurgency and counter terrorist training. It is suggested that all newly recruit armed police personnel and officers of ASI, SI, DySPof Mizoram Police may undergo regular training course at CIJW School, Vairengte. Regular refresher course for personnel of Mizoram Police may also be conducted.

1. **Identification of Special Security Zone:**

 Special attention should be given to districts having border with inter-state and international border viz. Mamit District, Kolasib District, Champhai District, Lawngtlai District and Siaha District. Due to its strategic location, the State is conduit for smuggling of contraband items viz. drugs, arms smuggling and insurgents groups in the neighbouring country and states also used the state as a transit. The Chakmas/Brus community dominated areas in the southern and western part of the state should need to be more focused in respect of security considering it vulnerability to communal violence and uprising of insurgency in the areas. It is imperative to find out the areas where special attention needs to be given in respect of security in the above district and that areas should be declared ‘Special Security Zone’ by the State Home Department. The task of identification of areas of Special Security Zone may be entrusted to the State Police and Intelligence Agencies.

 If the Special Security Zone is at the District Headquarters a district Level Committee headed by District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police as member Secretary comprising Head of Security Agencies, Leaders of NGOs and Leaders of Minority community as members should be set up to review security situation in the areas. Regular patrolling in the areas should be conducted in special security areas under the supervision of concern Superintendent of Police. If it is at Sub-Division Level, a Committee headed by SDO (Civil) and Sub-Divisional Police Officer as member Secretary comprising Head of Security Agencies, Concern Departments, Leaders of NGOs and Leaders of Minority communityas member should be set up to review security situation in the areas. The committee shall meet once in every quarter during enforcement of the status of Special Security Zone is in the areas.

Whenever, any communities/organizations/minority group etc. intend to hold public meeting, assembly, procession etc. which may invite any law and order situation within Special Security Zone, they must first obtain prior permission from the concern District Superintendent of Police.

**B. Assessing demographic changes with focus on migration of population away from international border in vulnerable areas and devising cost effective solutions for border management :**

INDO-MYANMAR BORDER :

 According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of unfenced International border with Myanmar, which are scattered around 30 - 40 small villages in Mizoram side. These International border posts with Myanmar are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Due to its long porous international border with Myanmar, influx of foreigners and large scale smuggling of drugs and various contrabands into the state through the porous borders has remained a serious concern for several decades.

 The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar allow Myanmar’s national to enter up to 16 kms into Mizoram Territory without any VISA restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the Indo-Myanmar.

 Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be of great assets for the government and the border guard alike.

INDO BANGLADESH BORDER :

 Mizoram shares 318 Km long international boundary with Bangladesh. These porous international borders with Bangladesh served as important routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs. The porous border areas have also widely encouraged other criminal activities like abduction/ kidnapping of Indian citizens by Bangladesh based insurgent groups.

 In order to curb the infiltration, smuggling and other anti-national activities from across the Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government has undertaken the construction of fencing along this border.

 The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was 344.41 Km.

 According to Mizoram State Boundary Committee, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram are now within Bangladesh side of the border due to irresponsibility of the construction companies who are fencing the Mizoram- Bangladesh border. The Boundary Committee also found that the fences pass through the middle of 20 other villages.

 Border fencing work could not be undertaken along a 60-km stretch in the Dampa Tiger Reserve owing to pending clearances from the National Board of Wildlife, which has demanded that the State transfer of around 1,520 hectares of non-forestland in compensation.

 Mizoram Chakma Development Forum (MCDF) claimed that about 49.7% of the total Chakma population in Mizoram has lost their houses, lands, cultivation fields and others properties due to the ongoing India-Bangladesh border fencing in Mizoram. On 21 April 2006, the State Government constituted a “State Level Co-ordination Committee on Border Fencing” to ensure that the victims received proper compensation and rehabilitation.

 In order to seal the Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government has adopted multi-pronged approach which include construction of fencing, floodlighting, Border Out Posts (BoPs), induction of latest surveillance equipments like Hand Held Thermal Imagers (HHTI), Night vision Goggle/Devices, etc.

**Ops briefing on IBB & Strengthening of Border Area Crime Control and Security & Monitoring Frame Work**

 In order to detect and deport settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram , 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.

 Illegal migration is significantly altering the demographic pattern of the border districts adjoining Bangladesh. While our general approach has been to improve the front line of the Border Security Force(BSF). It is also necessary that the State Governments be given assistance by the Centre to set-up civil police stations which could act as second layer behind the BSF/Border Out Posts (BOPs) to keep effective watch on happenings in border villages.

**Border Flood Lights**

 The progress of floodlighting work as on 31.12.2015 along Mizoram -Bangladesh border is as follows:

 Completed : 335.66 km.

 Sanctioned : 51.11km.

**Border Roads**

****Along Mizoram-Bangladesh Border, a stretch of 303.97 km. length of border patrol-roads has also been constructed out of the sanctioned length of about 602. 28 km.

**Border Out Posts (BOPs)**

****The BOPs are meant to provide appropriate show of force to deter trans-border criminals, infiltrators and the hostile elements from indulging in the activities of intrusion/ encroachment and border violations.

 Out of the total of 91 Border Out-Posts (BOPs) approved , the construction in respect of 18 BOPs has been completed and the work in other 73 BOPs are yet to be established along Mizoram-Bangladesh Borders. There are 3 Battalions of BSF in Mizoram presently. They are under a DIG and deployed along the 318 Kms long Indo-Bangladesh border. BSF Sector Headquarters is located in Durtlang, Aizawl.

 Mizoram Police had separately deployed security personnel (IR Bn.) along Indo-Bangladesh border and the expenditure incurred for performing such security duties were borned by the state government.

 It is therefore suggested that some discretionary component may be introduced under Security Related Expenditure (SRE) by Central Government so that state of Mizoram could act as effective layer behind Central Paramilitary Forces for safeguarding the territory of India.

**C.****RADICALISATIONS AND TERROR FUNDING****:**

 There is no record in the files of this office about registration of cases related to Radicalization. Further, there is neither no report of cases of financing terrorist nor insurgent/extremist.
