A mass rally was organized on 21.10.2019 by four Bru NGOs viz, i) MBDPF, ii) Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement (MBIDM), iii) Bru Tribal Development Society (BTDS) and iv) Bru Displaced Women Welfare Committee (BDWWC) and submitted a memorandum to Hon’ble Union Home Minister demanding the following:

1. Removal of Dampa Tiger Wildlife Sanctuary for the resettlement of Brus.
2. Formation of ‘Permanent Development Project’ exclusively for the Brus in Mizoram.
3. Immediate release of free ration and cash dole.

 The on-going Bru repatriation has been stalled on 31.10.2019 to 7.11.2019 due to road blockade between Kanchanpur and Ananda Bazar organised by various NGOs which was spearheaded by MBDPF in protest of stoppage of ration and cash-dole since 1st October, 2019. Placards containing the following slogans were displayed during the agitation -

 i)  Stoppage of ration is inhumane.

 ii)  Stoppage of ration is unconstitutional.

 iii)  No ration no rest.

 However, on 7.11.2019, after 8 (eight) consecutive days road blockade, it was called off after leaders of Bru NGOs held a meeting with Jishnu Dev Verma, Deputy Chief Minister, Tripura and other dignitaries from Tripura as the latter informed them that necessary steps will be taken for resumption of ration and cash dole till the completion of repatriation, ie, November, 2019.
