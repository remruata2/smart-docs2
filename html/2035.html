<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, Vanlalliana, S/o Saino Chondro (L) passed Class VIII from Saipullui village and did not continue further studies after completing HSLC. Later on, I got married and joined the MNF party where I rose up to become the unit secretary. I later on joined the RDP when it was formed in 1989 and became the Vice President. RJD later entered into an alliance with BJP. In 1994, I was elected V/C member at Sailupui. However, before the term of the V/C was over, I resigned from the V/C membership and migrated to Tuirum. While in Tuirum, I joined BNU. I was made Fin. Secretary and later became Gen. Secretary. The main objective of the party was to demand the status of district council for the Bru community. BNU later submitted a memorandum to the Govt. of India and Mizoram placing demand for the district council. However, there was a general feeling among the rank and file of the party that both the central and state Govt. did not give due cognizance and attention to our demand leading up to the formation of BNLF on 9.11.96 at Tuirum.</span></strong></span></span></p>

In 1997, I visited Aizawl and held a meeting with our supporters/sympathizers at Hotel Ritz. I later returned to D/B and continued as the president of the outfit.</span></strong></span></span></p>
