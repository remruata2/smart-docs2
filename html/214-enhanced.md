****FRESH ASSESSMENT OF SECURITY THREAT PERCEPTION IN RESPECT OF NIT, MIZORAM****

With regard to the impending issues between Mizo Students Union (MSU) and Director, NIT Mizoram, enquiry was conducted to ascertain the course of action of MSU as well as the threat perception thereon.

The election for the Office Bearers of the MSU General Headquarters was recently conducted on 31.10.2018. The newly elected leaders hardly had sit more than once for a meeting since then. The Executive Committee recently constituted had not convened any meeting. The Secretaries are yet to be appointed too.

Further, leaders of the MSU are approached so as to ascertain their schedule and issues to be pursued in the near future. It is learnt that MSU General Headquarters had no intention to raise any issue against Director, NIT, Mizoram ahead of the Mizoram General Election 2018.

Hence, it is concluded that the threat perception in respect of NIT, Mizoram is minimal at the moment.
