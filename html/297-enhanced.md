Ref: No. B.32020/3/2007-HMP. Dt.29.6.2010

Sir,

 With reference to the subject and Home Deptt. Letter mentioned above, I am sending detailed reports as under for your information and further submission to Home Deptt., Govt. of Mizoram.

 On 15.9.2009 Mizo Students' Union and Mizoram University authorities reached agreement over the mode of recruitment to various teaching and non-teaching posts under Mizoram University. The salient feature of the agreement among others is to give preference to the local qualified candidates in the screening and selection for various post of Asst. Professor (Post Graduate and Under Graduate) under Mizoram University. A minimum of six (6) qualified local candidates if available should be called for interview for each post.

 However, with the recruitment process underway, Mizoram Student Union felt that the Mizoram University authorities failed to honour the letter and spirit of the agreement between the Mizoram University authorities and Mizo Students' Union on 15.9.2009. Increasingly annoyed by the indifferent attitude of the Mizoram University, MSU decided to stage a strong protest against the recruitment by the Mizoram University.

 On 18.5.2010, about 70 activists of MSU gathered in front of Vice Chancellor’s Bungalow, Mizoram University Campus to protest against the mode of recruitment to various teaching and non-teaching posts under Mizoram University which was felt to be biased against the local eligible candidates. The student prevented the Vice Chancellor from attending the office to conduct interview slated for the day as part of their protest. The Police took preventive measure by arresting 60 MSU members who took part in the protest u/s 151 Cr.P.C (out of 60 student arrested 14 of them were released on health ground and 46 were detained) and they were directly sent to central jail for judicial remand. The Vice Chancellor left his bungalow for University campus at around 10:40 AM under Police escort.

 Meanwhile, more students from various institutions in Aizawl city assembled in the MSU office around 11:00 AM in support of the MSU agitation and passed 4 points resolution as under:- 1) Govt. should release the arrested MSU members before 2:00 PM today (i.e. 18.5.2010) unconditionally. 2) Prof. A.N. Rai, Vice Chancellor, Mizoram University should leave Mizoram before 3:00 PM of 9.5.2010. The MSU could not be held responsible for anything which might happen in the event Prof. A.N. Rai fail to leave Mizoram within the stipulated time. 3) Pu Benjamin, Registrar, Mizoram University who betrayed Mizo should leave his post before 21.5.2010. 4) MSU would carry on the agitation until the above 3 points are implimented and a state-wide agitation be organised if the need arises.

 Following the arrest of the MSU members by the police, MSU intensified its protest and staged a sit in demonstration in front of Vanapa Hall at 12:30 PM the same day.

 Meeting of District authorities with leaders of the MSU was then held at 1:30 PM in the office chamber of DC Aizawl. Eleven(11) student leaders including Zothanpuia, General Secy. and Adviser of the MSU attended the meeting. The District authorities pressurized the student leaders to call off their agitation and also to have a meeting with the Mizoram University authorities to sort out the problem.

 In pursuance to the meeting with the District authorities, the MSU also agreed to suspend their agitation till 1:00 AM of 19.5.2010 to create conducive atmosphere for the meeting with Mizoram University authorities as well as for the unconditional release of jailed fellow students. Joint Meeting of Mizoram University and MSU was scheduled to be held at the Chief Secretary’s bungalow at 7:00 PM. The arrested students were also released unconditionally.

 Accordingly at 8:00 PM, leaders of MSU, Govt. officials and Mizoram University authorities held a meeting at the Chief Secretary’s bungalow. Pu Vanhela Pachuau, IAS, CS (M) presided over the meeting and was attended by 8 members. The meeting discussed demands of MSU Gen. Hqrs., Aizawl in connection with the existing various recruitments being carried on by the Mizoram University authorities. The meeting reviewed the agreement made by the Mizoram University authority and the MSU Gen. Hqrs. mentioned in the first para and discussed at length. However, the meeting ended without having proper decision at 10:00 PM.

** On 19.5.2010 the MSU Gen. Hqrs., Aizawl had served an ultimatum signed by Zodinpuia, General Secy., MSU to Prof. A.N Rai, Vice Chancellor, Mizoram University, Aizawl in which the MSU demanded that he should resign from the post of Vice Chancellorship and leave Mizoram state on or before 19.5.2010 for violating the agreement made by Mizoram University authorities and leaders of MSU Gen. Hqrs on 15.9.2009.******

 In regard to providing security to the Vice Chancellor and staff members of Mizoram University, the Vice Chancellor himself had already been provided a PSO since March, 2009. During the recent incident, security arrangement was extended by providing Armed House Guard to the Vice Chancellor w.e.f. 18.5.2010 to 14.6.2010. Pu Benjamin, Registrar was also given the same treatment from 18.5.2010 to 30.5.2010.

_Enclo:_ 1. Ultimatum of MSU dt. 8.9.2009.

 2. Points of Agreement.

 3. Ultimatum of MSU dt. 19.5.2010.
