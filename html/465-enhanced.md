****STATEMENT OF V.LALFAKZUALA S/O V.LALSIAMA, GOVT. COMPLEX, LUANGMUAL.****

The unlawful manners of conducting interrogation to me by SI JH Chunglianthanga regarding the accusation of writing a letter to the President of India are as follows-

1. While interrogation was conducted at CID office, John got very furious and he pulled up his sleeves and said that how he wished to torture me. They could let him do such thing inside the office was unlawful.
2. Summon issued to me was based on Cr.PC 91/160 which was summon for witness but I was treated as a culprit. It was not correct to quotes such section for a person other than a witness.
3. At Zonuam outpost, Maliana talked to me impolitely. The way he talked to me showed that he disrespected me.
4. When we arrived CID Complex, Maliana wanted to look MPSOA building which was under construction. He told his subordinates to take me to the Office. He didn’t even mention my name. He did not respect me at all as I am an Ex-GS of MPSOA.

Q. Why did you enclose FSL DNA Examination Report in this letter?

Ans: Rohlupuii claimed Rodinpuii as my daughter. She demanded money for hospital expense. I demanded hospital discharge card but she could not produce any discharge card.I hired a Lawyer Zoramchhana, he advised me to do DNA Test. The test result showed that we are the biological mother and Father. I could not accept this DNA test result as the theory they are using is incorrect. I enclosed this test result to avoid appeal to higher court.

Q. Are you the one who write the letter?

Ans: No.

Q . Who do you think write the letter?

Ans: I dont know. But i think John was the one who wrote the letter. While he was very angry and even wanted to torture me, he smiled twice at CID Office. If it was not written by him, how could he smile at such situation?

Q . Do you have any hatred between you and John to write such letter?

Ans: We dont have any hatred. But when we met at Canteen B, Durtlang Hospital, he refused to return my greeting and I suspected since then. After which my fiancee Loisi turned hostile that confirm my suspicion. After Loisi turned hostile I gave my attention to Elizabeth.

Q . Why did you write a letter to DGP?

Ans: I think he is the one who can solve my problem. I want to re-enter into my previous job. I want to work again at Police Department. I do not want to bring up the matter to Magistrate and disgraced police department. I was mentally ill while i was applying for a voluntary pension. I was mentally unstable and i was treated by Dr.Hrekima, even my wife committed adultery because of my condition and we are divorced till date.
