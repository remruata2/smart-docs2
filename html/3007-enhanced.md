****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/868

Dated: 28th November, 2019.

  The ongoing stand-off between Mizoram Truck Drivers’ Association (MTDA) and Mizoram Carrying Contractors Association (MCCA) due to the claiming of maintenance of seniority of the trucks at FCI Godown could not be solved till today, i.e. 28.11.2019. Members of MTDA continued to gather at the premises of FCI Godown, Tanhril to prevent their members from loading rice for the past three weeks.

 Today, the defective Weigh-Bridge at Tanhril FCI Godown was working and one truckload of rice was transported out of the FCI Godown, Tanhril by Government Truck and another 2 (two) trucks, owned by members of MCCA, are in process of loading at the time of writing the report. Aizawl DEF deployed security forces to prevent any untoward incident.

 Information has been received that MTDA and Cachar Truck Drivers' Union held a joint meeting today, i.e. 28.11.2019 at the office of Silchar Drivers’ Union at Silchar. The meeting was attended by about 20 (twenty) members including 5 (five) Office Bearers from MTDA led by Pu Lalhmingliana, President. MTDA leaders apprised their counterpart Unions about the on-going dispute with MCCA and their demand for continued maintenance of seniority at FCI Godown. They requested them to extend their support to MTDA which was agreed by driver Unions from Silchar. Consequently, they resolved to enforce road blockade w.e.f. 29.11.2019 @ 5:00 a.m at Lailapur for HMV vehicles only including Tipper, Tanker and LPG carrying truck plying towards Mizoram. Meanwhile, input received indicated that vehicles like passenger carrying Bus, 407 truck and vehicles other than HMV will not be disrupted by the blockade.

 It may be mentioned that Pu K. Lalrinliana, MOS i/c FCS&amp;CA convened a meeting to consider resolution for the impasse tomorrow, i.e. 29.11.2019 @ 12:00 noon at his office chamber, New Secretariat Complex wherein MCCA, MTDA and MTOA are also included among the invitees.

 Further information received indicated that leaders of MTDA Sub-Hqrs. Kolasib are intending to deploy their members at Vairengte to resort road blockade instead of enforcing at Kolasib.

 It is not ascertained whether Driver Unions from Silchar will strictly enforce the road blockade as requested by MTDA. If they enforce the requisition and continued for longer period, scarcity of essential commodities could not be ruled out.

 Situation is under close watch.
