After struggling to achieve their objective by resorting to arms/ violence for 5 (five) consecutive years w.e.f. 1989 with 13 (thirteen) rounds of peace talks between the HPC and the Government of Mizoram, Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed between the two parties on 27.7.1994 which resulted into the setting up of Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) in 1997. However, certain members of HPC, led by Pu Lalhmingthanga Sanate of Khawlian village, who were disgruntled with the MoS, signed in 1994, had formed <strong>HPC (Democratic) in 1996</strong>.</span></span></span></p>

During that time, his group consisted of around 13 cadres with an estimated 4/5 weapons holding. However, by February 2020, 11(eleven) of his cadres deserted him and joined HPC(D)- General Headquarters Sinlung Group, who are under the leadership of Lalkhama @ LK Hmar.</span></span></span></p>
