****INDO-MYANMAR BORDER POLICING****

****(1) Concerns of the State Government with respect to the current state of India- Myanmar border policing:****

 Mizoram is having approximately 404 kms. porous international borders with Myanmar which are vulnerable to use by Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs. Besides, the Look East Policy actively pursued by Central and State Government is bound to bring our neighbours, i.e. Myanmar and other Asian Countries closer to our country in general and Mizoram in particular in all kinds of economic activity.

 Further, the upcoming Kolodyne Multimodal Project and Highway Project to connect Myanmar from the southern part of Mizoram would widely open trade and commerce activities manifold which would also have the potential to generate criminal activities such as - Arms Smuggling, Drugs Trafficking and International Terrorist Groups to cross over the border. Such activities will need to be effectively countered and neutralized at all costs in the interest of national security as a whole and the North Eastern region in particular.
