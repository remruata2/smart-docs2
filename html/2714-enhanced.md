****BRU MILITANCY****

****Since 1997, a group of Brus youth took up arms and started demanding a separate Autonomous District Council for the Brus residing in Mizoram and formed an armed group to support their demand. This armed group threatened the Brus of Mizoram to flee Mizoram. The fleeing Brus from Mizoram were designated in various refugee camps in Tripura. Inspite of an all out effort made by the Central Government and Mizoram Government to repatriate these Bru refugees, it appears that they still feel insecure against the Mizo communities and they are still reluctant to return to Mizoram.

Different armed groups of the Brus- BNA/BRA, BNLF or BLFM and BNCT are not active anymore. However, a new group Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM) was again formed recently under the patronage of NLFT. These BDFM cadres are mainly responsible for the heinous crimes which occurred in the western border areas of Mizoram during the recent past which included kidnapping for ransom, burglary of Government offices, etc.

**BRU DEMOCRATIC FRONT OF MIZORAM (BDFM):**

 Though exact time of its formation is not known, BDFM are the remnants of the then BLFM who refused to surrender at the time of the latter's mass surrender on 26.10.2006. They formerly call themselves as Bru Revolutionary Army(BRA), Bru Liberation Army(BLA) etc. They seem to have no concrete aims and objectives and are more likely to be an armed gang rather than a well organised militant group.

 **Their areas of influences:**

****Zopui, Thangnang, Sahdah.

Hence WPLG C/No.4/13 dt.20.2.13 u/s 364(A)/34 IPC r/w 25(1A) Arms Act was registered.  After prolonged pressure and persuasive method being used by Govt. of Mizoram in close co-ordination with Mizos living in Bangladesh, the hostages were freed by the captors at Indo-Bangla border village called Silsury on 29.3.2013.  2. On 23.11.2013, a combined militant group of National Liberation Front of Tripura(NLFT) and Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram(BNDLFM) abducted three persons namely - 1) Sanglianthanga S/o VL. Hmuaka of Mamit 2) Lalzamliana S/o Buanga(L) of Kolasib and 3) Deep Mandal S/o Nikhil Mandal of West Bengal from anti-poaching camp area in Mamit District. The abductors had taken them inside Bangladesh and demanded Rs.5 crores for ransom. In this connection, West Phaileng Police Station Case No.24/2013 Dt.25.11.2013 u/s 364 A/379/34 IPC R/w Sec 25(1A) Arms Act has been registered. Due to increasing efforts of the Government of Mizoram as well as various groups of NGOs and Churches, two of the abducted persons namely Sanglianthanga and Lalzamliana were unconditionally released by the abductors and safely arrived in Mizoram on 21.1.2014 at around 11:30am after sixty days in captivity and due to the initiative taken by Mizoram Police, Deep Mandal(25) S/o Nikhil Mandal, Indas, Bankura District, West Bengal was released by the abductors i.e. National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and Bru Development Front of Mizoram(BDFM) on 22.3.2014 after he was held captive inside Bangladesh for 119 days.  3. It is learnt that the Bru militants had changed the name of BNDLFM(Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram) as BDFM (Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram) on December 2013.  4. The BDFM S/S Commander Thlamuana also made extortion demands through telephone calls on 7.2.2014 from Refugee Camps, N.Tripura as well as from some Bru villages of Mamit District, Mizoram, such as Thaidawr, Tumpanglui etc @ Rs. 350/- per household to be deducted from the NREGS funds.  5. A group numbering seven of BDFM armed with AK-47 and small arms have crossed Bangladesh border near Zopui at 6:30am on 9.2.2014 with a plan to carry out extortion inside Bru refugee camps. The groups are likely to infiltrate into Bru refugee camps only with camps only with small arms via Thailihpara under Anando Bazar P/S jurisdiction, N.Tripura, and the group is learnt to have demanded deduction of funds meant for refugee aid @ Rs.10/- per adult and Rs.5/- per minor per month. The BDFM is a group known to be involved in several abduction cases inside Mizoram and Tripura during recent past, based in Tarunpara jungles (Bangladesh) under the active patronage of NLFT.   6. Input received indicated that the Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram(BDFM) are planning to disrupt the proposed repatriation of Bru refugees. The input received suggests possible plot by the outfit to carry out abduction targeting Mizos in the western belt of Mamit district in the near future.   The threat came in the wake of the Government's commitment made to the NGO Co-ordination Committee recently to delete Bru refugees from Mizoram Electoral Roll who fail to return to Mizoram even after repeated appeals.  |
