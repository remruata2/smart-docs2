After that, I worked as a labourer in our own agricultural land. In 2016,I came to Gazipur, Dhaka in search of work. I then rented a room at Gazipur and worked as a helper in some construction works and earned about 400 Taka per day.</span></span></span></span></p>

He was a Mason by profession and used to visit Gazipurlabour market in search of work. There was a Mosque at the Gazipur market where along with &nbsp;Bashir, we do used to offer Namaz (prayer) together and had some normal conversation and Salam Dua (Remembrance)etc.</span></span></span></span></p>

I had developed a good relation with Bashir and after 2/3 months, Bashir began to talk and introduced me with regard to Islam and Jihadetc. and my interest in Islamic studies grew more and more.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

After quite some time, Bashir asked my opinion about joining any Jihadi organization for the sake of&nbsp; Allah to which I replied that I wanted to join such organization that works for the establishment of Jihadi group and Deen (Muslims way of life) in the land of Allah</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">.</span></span></span></span></p>

I had accepted the offer after which Bashir taught me several intelligence related and secure communication techniques. I was trained and instructed to become familiar with Protected Text (PT) Chat, a secure means of communication. Bashir had created PT Text ID and password for me to enable me to use the said secure communication application to ensure constant communication with him.</span></span></span></span></p>

I then rented a room at the rate of 2000 Taka per month. After about 15 days, Bashir came and met me at Kachpur. After two days, one Abdulla (Address not known) joined me for training. This was all organized by Bashir.</span></span></span></span></p>

It was during the later part of the training that Bashir brought one pistol (name/model not known) with 17 rounds and taught us how to handle and use it. We kept the pistol with us in our rented house uptill the end of the training. After the training,we all parted and too went back to Gazipur.

For the preparation of the fake Aadhar Card, I travelled to Mirpur, Dhaka, which is known for making fake Indian documents. I managed to obtain fake/forged Indian Aadhar Card for me by the name of ShohanMolla S/o SanowarMolla of Khorda, Hasnabad, 24 Parganas, West Bengal<em>(forged Indian Aadhar Card no.958136395645</em>).

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was during the first week of <strong>October 2018</strong> that I had entered into Indian territory from Kasba-Kamalasagar(Indo-Bangla border) by evading BGB and BSF guards at the border and reached Agartala. On reachingAgartala, I then rented a room at <strong>Ramnagar area of Agartala</strong>at Rs. 1500 per month and started selling Amra (Hog Plum), Pitha(Rice Cake), etc. for the next 3 months.</span></span></span></span></p>

It was during my stay in Dharmanagar that I had asked Bashir to deliver some money. Bashir then made arrangement to collect a sum of Rs.21,000 from an unknown person at CNG Station, near Agartala Railway Station for which I collected accordingly.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was during late April 2019 that Bashir had instructed me again to shift to Kanchanpur, NorthTripura,which was close to Mizoram. On reaching Kanchanpur I rented a room at LalMia&rsquo;s house @ Rs. 1500/- per month. After staying after about one month in Kanchanpur, I again urged Bashir to provide me some money for which he again made arrangement and I received Rs. 20000/- at Masjid in Bishalgarh, Agartala from unknown person.</span></span></span></span></p>

As per instructions of Bashir, I used to buy new mobile phones every time he changed his locations, and also bought new pre-activated forged Sim cards from Agartala market at high price. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">On 19th July&rsquo; 2019, I came alone in Mizoram upto Rajiv Nagar and stayed in the house of one Chakma (name not known) for a night, but as I&nbsp; could not find any suitable place for my immediate accommodation, I then went back to Kanchanpur</span></span></span></span></p>

The next day, as we missed missed the Maxicab service for West Phaileng, we then decided to go to West Phaileng via Marpara. We then contacted one boatman who could drop us to Marpara and found one boatman who charged us@ Rs. 500/- per head. The boatman then took usuptoSilsuri only. We stayed at the boatman&rsquo;s house as there was no hotel or Rest House at Silsuri.</span></span></span></span></p>

At Marpara, we met with one businessman from Silchar who told us whether we possessed any ILP pass or not as it is mandatory to enter Mizoram. We again took a boat for Silsuri. On reaching Silsuri, we could not find any boat bound for Rajiv Nagar. We then decided to stay at Silsuri, but since nobody were willing to accommodate us in their houses, we were told to meet with the Village Chief. The Village Chief brought in BSF officials and after they interrogated us, they felt suspicious of our behavior and handed us over to the MarparaPolice on 29th July&rsquo; 2019 </span></span></span></span></p>
