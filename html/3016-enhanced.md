Dated: 7th October, 2019.

 The Repatriation process of Brus living in Tripura Transit Camps was continued for the fourth day today, i.e. 7.10.2019. But two organisations, viz. Bru Internal Displaced People (BIDP) and Mizoram Bru Displaced Women Organization (MBDWO) organized agitations at the following camps –Kaskau, Khakchangpara and Asapara and prevent officials and vehicles from Mizoram entering into their Relief Camps.

 About 400 (four hundred) persons assembled at the junction of Kaskau holding placards displaying their various demands as follows :-

1. No ADC, No repatriation.
2. We want justice, arrangement of Peace Talk immediately before repatriation starts.
3. Do not allure our inmates to repatriate to Mizoram and kill us there.
4. We want the reasons why our inmates are repatriated with Black Flag in their vehicles.
5. We want Peace Talks and withhold the repatriation process.
6. We want to create an Autonomous District for our community.
7. We want formation of cluster/model villages in Mizoram, etc.

 About 700 (seven hundred) persons from Asapara, Naisingpara and Hazachhera Camps assembled at the junction of Asapara Transit Camp holding placards displaying their various demands which were on the same line with that of Kaskau agitators.

 They also mentioned about their condemnation of the burning to death of one Bru woman, namely Linda (33) w/o Vanlalvena of Tlangkhang, Mamit District on 5.10.2019 and alleged the husband as the culprit and demanded investigation of the case and awarding of severe punishment.

 Since officials for conducting the repatriation were prevented by the agitators, officials and their vehicles returned to Mizoram.

 Information received indicated that their future course of actions are not yet chalked out by the NGOs but are intending to take any necessary actions. It is also learnt that they are willing to prevent the on-going repatriation process also and will issue a Press Release by tomorrow, i.e. 8.10.2019 in this regard.

 In the meantime, two families, comprising of 9 (nine) family members, were repatriated today for further resettlement to Hortoki.
