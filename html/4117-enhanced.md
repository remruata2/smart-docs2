**(b) Current trends in smuggling of narcotics drugs, arms, explosives, WLS and other contrabands :**

****Drug Smugglings****

 Mizoram being geographically close to the Golden/Death Triangle and due to the porous unfenced international border with Myanmar became a frequented route for drug smugglers in recent years. Mizoram which also shares inter-state boundary with three other Indian states is also used as a gateway for trafficking of drugs and other contraband items from Myanmar to Mainland India. Also, the recent unrest in Myanmar causing the decline in the number of military check gates on the Myanmar side and the Myanmar Nationals seeking asylum in India acting as a peddlers/dealers to support themselves financially resulted in the increase of drugs trafficking in Indo-Myanmar border. As communal violence occurred in Manipur, which was reportedly one of the major smuggling routes, smugglers could no longer used Manipur as their route; the peaceful state of Mizoram become more vulnerable to such smugglers.
