 The Arakan Army (AA) was founded on 10 April 2009 along with its political wing, theUnited League of Arakan(ULA), in what it describes as its "temporary headquarters" in Laiza, Kachin State.The group has stated that it advocates for:

- self-determination for the multi-ethnic Arakanese population
- the safeguarding and promotion of the national identity and cultural  heritage of the Arakan people
- the "national dignity" and best interests of the Arakan people

 Following training, the group had planned to return to Arakan State and fight for self-determination; however, with the outbreak of fighting in Kachin State in June 2011, they were unable to return.
