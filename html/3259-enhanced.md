QUALITY POLICY

Asteria Aerospace is committed to delivering products to the highest quality standards and achieving full compliance with quality management processes across all phases of product development and deployment.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

At Asteria, we follow a rigorous product development process which starts with detailed system and subsystem requirements, followed by design, implementation/manufacture, subsystem level testing and finally system level testing. Supporting documentation for validation and verification is created at each stage in the process. This process allows us to maintain traceability from start to finish as well as mitigate issues as early as possible in the development cycle in order to create and deliver quality products to our clients.
