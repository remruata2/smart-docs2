6. Challenges and issues faced by CID (SB) :

 The signing of Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) between Government of Mizoram and HPC-D (Zosangbera faction) on 2.4.2018brought to an end of insurgent activities in Mizoram. The last insurgency related fatality in Mizoram occurred on 28th March, 2025 when 3 (three) Mizoram Police officers were killed by HPC-D at Zokhawthiang. Meanwhile, cross border extortion activities conducted by another faction of HPC-D led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate along Mizoram-Manipur border can be claimed as insignificant and no serious threat is perceived from them.

 However, due to the ongoing conflict between Myanmar military junta and the resistance ethnic armed groups, hundreds of refugees streamed into Mizoram following clashes between the two parties. The influx of refugees and lack of proper check gates in Myanmar along the Mizoram - Myanmar border areas resulted in an enormous increase in the flow of narcotic contrabands through Mizoram state in recent years. In order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security and intelligence networks along the border of Mizoram and Myanmar.

Not only in Myanmar border, there have been frequent armed clashes between government forces and insurgent groups in the neighbouring Bangladesh in recent months. These incidents often resulted in civilians entering Mizoram state as the inhabitants of both sides of these border areas are normally close related ethnic groups. To prevent the spreading of the conflict as well as to monitor the movement of cadres of the insurgent groups inside Mizoram territory, close monitoring of the border areas is imperative so as to obtain advance intelligence for the safety of the state.
