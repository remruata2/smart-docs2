**The Free Movement Regime (FMR) along the Indo-Myanmar Border****:**

 Mizoram shares a 510-kilometer-long border with Myanmar, which remains unfenced and porous. Six districts in the state adjoin the international border, with Champhai district sharing the longest border with Myanmar.

 The Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that enables citizens of both countries to travel freely within a 10-kilometer radius of the border for up to 7 days without the need for a visa. This initiative aims to preserve traditional ties and alleviate insecurity for tribal communities residing along the border.

 The FMR spans 1,629.5 kilometers of unfenced border shared between 4 (four) Indian States - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram - and Myanmar. In January 2018, the Union Cabinet approved a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance economic interactions through this regime.

**Border Fencing and Free Movement Regime Abolition******:

 On February 28, 2024, the Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Indian government’s proposal to build a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and to abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR). Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution expresses concerns that these measures would negatively impact the Zo ethnic communities, which have been historically divided by the border established during British colonial rule. The Assembly contends that strengthening this division with additional barriers would disturb the livelihoods and social connections of the border communities.

****3. (a) Conflict situation in Myanmar/Chin State and its implications on Indian side (AR,BSF,SB/CID, Special Bureau, Military Int)****

 The conflict situation in Myanmar is complex and ongoing, situation remains volatile with ongoing clashes between the Military and various armed groups. On 02.07 2025, intense fighting broke out between CNDF (Chin National Defense Force) and HPO (Hualngo People’s Organization) cadres in Phunte village and Tuichirh area, Falam District, Myanmar, approximately 18 km from Zokhawthar (India-Myanmar border).

 The exchange of fire followed after weeks of rising tensions and joint meeting at Kawt Sei on 18 May 2025. During the fighting, CNDF forces reportedly captured Phunte and Lianhna camps, detaining a total of 10 HPO cadres and seizing 10 firearms.

 Both sides’ leaders—Laltanpuia @ Puitea (HPO) and Peter Thang (CNDF)—have been accused of exchanging inflammatory remarks on social media, worsening hostilities.

 HPO has restricted the movement of villagers suspected of supporting CNDF, while CNDF has accused HPO of enabling free movement of rival groups. Due to the clash on 02.07.2025, some civilians fleeing the Khawmawi area are seeking safety, while others have returned, deeming conditions stable. However, no reports confirm people fleeing with possessions, and the precise number of civilians who fled or returned remains unclear.

 

 On 03.07.2025 afternoon, fresh encounter occurred between the said group at Kawtsei, Chin State, Myanmar, later in the evening the village was taken over by CNDF.

According to reports, a significant firefight occurred this afternoon between the CNDF and CDF (HPO). The CNDF reportedly seized control of Kawtsei Camp, a key stronghold of the CDF. Sources state that the CDF (HPO) now retains only 2 (two) major bases, Rihkhawdar and Khawmawi, with no other notable outposts. No deaths or serious injuries were reported in today's conflict.

 The situation remains tense and could escalate further if not addressed.

1. **Narcotics drugs smuggling trends/Opium cultivation in Chin State and possible nexus among IIGs**

The modus operandi and ways of concealment of smuggled narcotics used by smugglers is constantly evolving. The past seizures of narcotics in the state revealed that these drugs are often concealed in sealed food packages, vegetables, electrical goods and more commonly inside a car door panel or costumed concealed compartment inside a vehicle. Further, the emerging trend of using end to end encrypted messaging applications and compartmentalizing activities like logistics, finances or intelligence gathering by different groups or units complicated the interception of modern narcotics syndicates.

During this year till 21st May, 2025, most of the drugs seized i.e. 80 % (approx.) are destined to Assam and other outerstate whereas 20 % (approx.) are destined for local consumption which are mostly transported from Myanmar.

**Myanmar Situation Update:**

 On 2 July 2025, intense clashes erupted between two ethnic groups in Myanmar, the Chin National Defence Force (CNDF) and the Hualngoram People’s Organisation (HPO)/Chin National Army (CNA), near Phunte and Tuichirh, approximately 10 km from Zokhawthar in Myanmar’s Falam District.

The HPO has imposed strict controls on the movement of people and market activities in villages aligned with the CNDF. The CNDF has accused the HPO of restricting the free movement of Zohnathlak residents in the Falam District.

The conflict began in Phunte and Satawm, with unconfirmed reports suggesting that fighting may have extended to Lianhna. The CNDF reportedly seized control of the Phunte and Satawm camps, capturing 10 HPO/CNA soldiers and confiscating firearms at the Phunte camp.

3 July 2025

Clashes continued on the afternoon of 3 July 2025 between the CNDF and the HPO faction of the Chin Defence Force (CDF). The CNDF captured Kawtsei Camp, a significant HPO stronghold. Sources indicate that the CDF (HPO) now controls only two major bases, Rihkhawdar and Khawmawi, with no other significant outposts. No fatalities or serious injuries were reported during the day’s conflict.

Due to the ongoing violence, many residents of Khawmawi have fled to Zokhawthar, seeking refuge with relatives and at the YMA Hall. As of the evening of 3 July, 275 displaced individuals arrived in Zokhawthar. The Zokhawthar border gate was temporarily closed at 11:40 PM on 3 July. Displaced persons have been directed to register at the Registration Centre on 4 July 2025 under the Free Movement Regime (FMR).

**Bangladesh Operation Update:**

On 3 June 2025, at approximately 3:00 AM, the Bangladesh Army conducted an operation against a Kuki-Chin National Army (KCNA) hideout in Chalchara Khal, Paindu Union, Ruma Upazila, Bandarban District. During the operation, two KCNA members, Captain Sangmin Bawm (27), alias Putin, and Lalhimsang Bawm (25), alias Aahim, were killed. No casualties were reported among the Bangladesh Army personnel. The army recovered two MA-3 rifles, one AK-47 rifle, one Chinese SKS rifle, eight magazines, and a quantity of ammunition from the site.

A Bangladesh Army patrol team, accompanied by three guides (suspected to be KCNA or Bawm members wearing black masks), traveled to Prangsa Para in Ruma Upazila the previous night in eight military vehicles. The army subsequently located the KCNA hideout, consisting of three farming houses (Jum Ghar), and opened fire. Local Bawm community leaders and intellectuals reportedly cooperated with the army by providing precise intelligence and indirectly supporting the operation, as the KCNA has become increasingly isolated from its own community.
