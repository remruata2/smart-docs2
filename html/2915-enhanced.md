 Earlier, NGOCC Kolasib alleged that Dr. Arun T had illegally enrolled new Bru voters residing at Tripura Transit Camps in the 2nd Special Summary Revision of Electoral Roll, 2018 after official hearing date was over which was in contravention of the Notification of Election Commission of India.

DC, Kolasib reported that 468 (four hundred sixty eight) appeal forms from Brus had been received by the office and of these, 218 (two hundred eighteen) applicants were added and as many as 250 (two hundred fifty) applicants were rejected. In the meeting, NGOCC demanded the DEO to write a requisition letter to higher authority to roll back the newly enrolled Bru voters and to delete them from the Electoral Roll.

 Subsequently, NGOCC Kolasib filed PIL to the Hon’ble Gauhati High Court, Aizawl Bench on 14.11.2018 which was admitted by the Court but the same was temporarily withdrawn by NGOCC on the advice of their advocates as they intended to file a separate Election Petition.
