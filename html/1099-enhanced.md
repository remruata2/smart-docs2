****REPORT ON CONFRONTATION BETWEEN ACCOUNTANT GENERAL MIZORAM AND MUSTER ROLL WORKERS****

******Office of the Accountant General, Mizoram was established in the year 2010 and presently there are around 120 regular staff with 30 muster roll (contract) employees out of 50 posts. Since its inception, there has been four persons who has hold the position of Accountant General:**

 1) Vishal Bansal IA&amp;AS  - June 2009 to June 2010

 2) Lalramthanga Tochhawng IA&amp;AS - June 2010 to Aug. 2015

 3) H.K Dharmadarsi IA&amp;AS - Sept. 2015 to April 2018

 4) Pravindra Yadav IA&amp;AS  - 23rd April 2018 till date.

 The present Accountant General, Mr. Pravindra Yadav took over the office from 23.4.2018. Unlike previous Accountant Generals, favoritism prevails in the office which was never experienced before. His predecessor, Mr. HK. Dharmadarsi, on the other hand, was said to have taken a keen interest in the welfare of his staff especially the contract employees and had even hiked their salaries.

 The term for contract workers are renewed every year where renewal was done before the end of every eleventh month. Even now, the file concerning the renewal process was already put up to the Accountant General on 9th July, 2018 which, till today, did not materialized. While the contract workers hopefully waited for the renewal, the Accountant General, on 28.8.2018 directed two of his sub-ordinates; 1) Mr. Hautinlala Suantak. Sr.Deputy Accountant General (Audit) and 2) Mr. Tanmay Jana Sr. Deputy Accountant General (Audit &amp; Account in-charge) to inform these contract workers about the termination of their contract from 1st September, 2018.

 On receiving this information, the present 30 contract workers were extremely disappointed with the decision of the Accountant General. On 28.8.2018, these contractual employees met the Accountant General at his office in which he told them that renewal of their contract was his sole discretion. The Accountant General told them that he will consult other authorities about contractual terms which in turn could be to their advantage. On the other hand, these contract workers insisted on having assurance (in writing) that their contract would be renewed after one month along with a copy of his intended letter to CAG.

 When they could not get the assurance, these aggrieved contract workers again sought an interview with the Accountant General on 29th August, 2018. The Accountant General reportedly informed them to wait as he was having discussion with his senior officers regarding the matter. After the meeting, these two officers conveyed the message that there was no retraction of the previous decision about the renewal and that the termination still stands.

 Having no other options, the contract workers then sought the assistance of leaders of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) General Headquarters for resolving their grievance.

 In response to this request, on 29.8.2018 @ 3:00pm, some members of MZP General Headquarters led by Lalnunmawia Pautu, General Secretary went to meet the Accountant General, who in turn refused to meet them. The MZP members left leaving a message to the PA of the Accountant General that they expect a withdrawal of the termination of the contract of the Muster Roll employees before 7:00pm of the same evening i.e. 29.8.2018, failing which further actions will be initiated.

 Since there was no reply from the Accountant General, MZP General Headquarters called an extended Office Bearers meeting at their office today, i.e. 30.8.2018 @ 10:00 am.

 This meeting of MZP Office Bearers which was presided over by their President, L.Ramdinliana Renthlei strongly believed that Shri Pravindra Yadav had a discriminatory attitude towards the tribal people, but still decided to find ways to diffuse the situation. Accordingly, 15 members of MZP led by their President went to the Accountant General’s Office at 12:30 pm today i.e. 30.8.2018. But the AG’s Office was closed and the where about of the Accountant General was not known. The members of MZP gathered infront of the main gate of the Accountant General’s Office where L.Ramdinliana Renthlei, President, MZP and Ricky Lalbiakmawia, Fin. Secretary, North Eastern Students Organisation (NESO) delivered a short speech each. Both stated that the Accountant General is unsuitable for Mizoram because of his contempt for the tribal people.

 Then they peacefully dispersed from the spot.

 CONCLUSION: Information has been collected in connection with the above cited case. Employees whether regular or contractual, were examined thoroughly. It was reported that Shri. PravindraYadav, IA&amp;AS, took over the charge of Accountant General on 23.04.2018, after a five year stint in London. Since his joining, there has been accusation of arrogance and callous treatment of AG staff especially the tribal people. There is wide-spread discontent in his administration which they claimed never happened with his predecessors. One source has disclosed that even his senior officers are also unhappy with his general ill-treatment of the staff. The source also stated that one of the mid-level non-Mizo officers has even suggested making a collective approach to the Hon’ble Chief Minister to present their grievances. Report also stated that he has been keeping the contract renewal document in his office for quite some time and when the contract employees approached him, he told them that he would terminate their employment and all the while submitted a report to CAG stating that he was threatened by them and that they ransacked his office. But there has been neither any evidence of threat from the contractual employees nor physical evidence of ransacking the office. He is supposed to go on leave from 1.9.2018 to 15.9.2018 but left Aizawl today, i.e. 30.1.2018 on the instruction of CAG and the AG Office has been closed. There is report that the MZP intended to prevent him from attending his Office even after his return from his leave till he withdraws the termination of contract of the 30 contractual employees. The Accountant General’s Office remained closed till today i.e. 31.8.2018.
