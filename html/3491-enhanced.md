**Heedless Border Area****:**There has always been dispute between Mizoram and Assam over land, and unfortunate incidents happen from time to time because of it. Every time, Assam create trouble there has always been commotion from Mizoram but the fact is that the number of MRP post in border area is never sufficient.

 The two check gate at Vairengte are watched over by MRP, and there are around 31 Police Post there including 2 drivers. Both check gates has 5 Police each on duty at a time, and due to shortage of police, one Police officer has to be in charge of both check gates at a time and meanwhile he has to be on duty at Thana. According to rules, there has to be separate Police duty for day and night but at Vairengte, they sometimes have to be on day duty and throughout the night. Vairengte Police have 1 Sumo, 1 bike and 1 gypsy. 1 platoon of 3rd IR Bn. is also there, so there are around 64 Police personnel along with all the MRP in all. Moreover, Vairengte Police have to watch over Saiphai check gate from Vairengte.

 Bairabi has 1 check gate which is watched over by MRP with around 18 Police personnel. With Inspector as its head, they have to be on duty at PS and check gate. Bairabi has also has 1 platoon of IR Bn. who watched over Train Station, FCI Godown and Bairabi Thermal Plant.

 This is how Mizoram looks after the North end border where it has land dispute with Assam. MRP have so many duties to perform that their number is not sufficient to do it all. "Mizoram always raised its voice every time Assam creates trouble but it seems that Mizoram has not paid enough heed to border area", said sources.
