****Agenda for Chief Minister's Conference on Internal Security to be held on 1st february, 2011 at new delhi****

***********

**2. Internal security situation in Mizoram**

 Mizoram is one of the most peaceful States in the country. In fact in the strife-torn North East India, Mizoram can boast of being the least militant infected State mainly because the budding militancy have been nabbed by Mizoram Police in its infant stage. The last of such militant was the coming overground 64 strong SPLA cadres just after completion of their training somewhere in the border between Myanmar and Manipur under the eagis of PREPAK in 2009.

 The armed groups of Bru refugee which sometimes create problem in the west and north-west part of Mizoram have also been contained and their activities have not been heard of during the last many days.

 The HPC'D' Manipuri based militant of Mizo Hmar Community has also come to the negotiating table with the Govt. of Mizoram for the permanent solution of ethnic problem. A truce, termed suspension of operation had also been signed and the Govt. look forward to having the next round of meeting. Collection of taxes in their so called demand area has also not heard of.

 Besides, the above noted armed groups operating from across the inter-state boundary which had been more or less contained there are other insurgent outfit like the NLFT, NSCN(IM), ALP having base camp across the international border neighbouring Mizoram. Movement of this militant have been closely watched and have never pose major threat to the internal security in Mizoram.

 It is often said that the above noted militant and other militants of the North East are using Mizoram for the trafficking of arms consignment. Considering seizure of huge cache of arms prior to 2009 this notion could not be ruled out. However, it could also boldly be said that arms trafficking has been successfully checked during the last two years.

 There was no fresh report of activities of Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) Manipuri based militant operating in the adjacent area of North Eastern part of Mizoram.

 The overall security situation in Mizoram could be said peaceful.

**5. Intelligence Wing-Strengthening**

 During the last three years, the Special Branch have been strengthened to meet the requirement of the ever increasing duties and responsibilities of the Special Branch. During the year 2008 to 2010, surveillance equipment of the following were given to this unit while other proposals are also being made for procuring other equipments from 5% of MPF Scheme.

 1) Digital Voice Logger with SMS retreaver

 2) 2(two) nos. of Bushnell Binoculars

 3) Bushnell Telescope with Digital Video Recorder

 4) Pen Style Video Recorder

 5) Computer with accessories

 As the above surveillance equipments were given to this unit, Police personnel especially having a computer and technical know how who will be looking after the Technical Branch to work in three shifts for 24 hrs. is currently required.

**ANALYSIS GROUP:**

 The Hon'ble Home Minister Shri P. Chidambaram, in his letter to the Hon'ble Chief Minister, Mizoram Pu Lalthanhawla dt. 17.12.2008 suggested that the State Intelligence Wing must have an Analysis Group that will receive, collate, analyse, link up with previous inputs and disseminate intelligence input which should work in two shifts totalling 16 hrs. Requirement of man power for Analysis Group comprising Dy.SP -1(one), Inspector -2(two), Sub-Inspector -4(four) was also submitted, but not yet sanctioned.

**PAID SOURCES:**

 Inspite of the strengthening of Special Branch staff in the level of Sub-Inspector, Head Constable and Constable, the strength of this unit is falling short of the requirement to collect advance information particularly on the movement of insurgent outfit, arms smuggler and so on. To make wider covering of the areas bordering Myanmar and Bangladesh and other strategic areas and also for the timely collection of intelligence, the need to engage paid sources could not be over emphasised. It may be suggested that budgetary provision may be made available for the engagement of atleast 30(thirty) nos. of paid sources under the discretionary power of Special Branch.

**10. Issues related to border management**

 It is a well known fact that Mizoram is sandwiched by two foreign countries i.e Myanmar in the east and the south and Bangladesh in the west. The length of international border with Myanmar in the east and south is 404 kms. whereas length of boundary with Bangladesh is 300 kms. To mann the international borders, Central Para-Military Forces namely Assam Rifles and Border Security Force have been deployed along the Indo-Myanmar border and Indo-Bangla border respectively. The main duties of these Central Para-Military Forces are to check infiltration of the Indian insurgent having base camp across international border and also illegal trafficking of arms and other contraband items.

 Border fencing project in western sector of the boundaries is also in progress which is directly dealt with by Home Department.
