****WRITE-UP ON FREE MOVEMENT REGIME (FMR) INSIDE MIZORAM ALONG INDO-MYANMAR BORDER****

Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that allows free movement of Indian and Myanmarese citizens within 16 km of the border without Visa restrictions for 72 hours. Its purpose is to alleviate insecurity of tribals living along India and Myanmar Border as they still continue to have trans-border linkages with their kiths and kins. This regime has been in place to protect traditional social relations among border people. It helps genuine people living in the close proximity of the border. India and Myanmar share 1,629.531 km unfenced border along four states viz. Arunachal Pradesh (520 km), Nagaland (215km), Manipur (398 km) and Mizoram (496.531 km) and permit free movement regime upto 16 km beyond border. In January 2018, Union Cabinet had approved agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) between India and Myanmar on land border crossing to enhance economic interaction between people of the two countries.

However, the Ministry of Home affairs said that it is misused by militants and criminals who smuggle weapons, narcotics, contraband goods and Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN). The statement issued by the ministry of home affairs went on to add that with fast improving security situation in this region, militants are denied hideouts here and some of them have relocated themselves across the border. Taking advantage of the free-movement regime occasionally they enter India, commit crimes and escape to their relatively safer hide-outs.

 Mizoram shares 496.531 kms long border with Myanmar. Six Districts of the State such as Champhai, Serchhip, Lawngtlai, Siaha, saitual and Hnahthial Districts share border with Myanmar. Of the six Districts, Champhai shares the longest border with Myanmar.
