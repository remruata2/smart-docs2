****PROTEST AGAINST ALLEGED INACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT****

****OF MIZORAM TOWARDS SOLVING THE BOUNDARY DISPUTE WITH ASSAM****

 Around 4,000 students of various colleges took to the street on 19.7.2019 in protest against alleged inaction of the Government of Mizoram towards solving the boundary dispute with Assam. The processionists shouted slogans mainly deploring Government's inaction on boundary issue. The procession started at 11:00 a.m from Zarkawt and Khatla and then converged in front of Vanapa Hall where they adopted resolutions as follows :-

i) Government of Mizoram should initiate action to immediately solve the boundary dispute with Assam so as to stop the encroachment by Assam.

ii) We appreciate the Government's stand on boundary as per BEFR 1875, and urged the Government to initiate steps to demarcate boundary accordingly so as to reclaim the illegal occupation of 509 sq. miles area within the Inner line Forest.

iii) Government should make new political map of Mizoram based on BEFR 1875 as the current map is not acceptable.

iv) Government should take action against all illegal settlers in disputed area including Assam Forest Deptt. as per Scheduled Caste and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
v) MZP will persistently fight to protect our land.

 MZP protesters also burnt existing map of Mizoram as they did not accept the boundary demarcation.

 Addressing the crowd, MZP President, L. Ramdinliana Renthlei had accused the Government of not being keen to solve the boundary issue, and also lamented on the excesses committed on MZP protesters at Zophai by Assam Police last year. He further reiterated the MZP's commitment to fight and protect the boundary.

 The student protesters dispersed at 12:30 p.m and no untoward incident has been reported during the procession.
