**PROPOSAL FOR PROCUREMENT OF EQUIPMENTS ETC. FOR CID(SB)**

1. **Communication :**

This unit is having 14 Out Posts mostly situated in the border areas. Up-gradation by means of communication between the Sector Officers of this Out Posts and the Headquarters is the urgent need of this Unit. Information and Intelligence, etc. are sent to the Hqrs. through W.T. Messages which are not found safe and secure. There is often delay in transmission of this messages which requires prompts supervision and direction from the Hqrs. It is, therefore, felt necessary to install telephone (Land Line) connection along with Fax Machines in CID (SB) Out Posts where these facilities are available. At present out of these 14 Out Posts, only Vairengte SB post is provided with telephone (Land Line) facility. It is proposed that telephone connection along with Fax Machines may be provided in the Out Posts, having strategic importance to facilitate quicker means of communicating vital intelligence and informations, etc. which will be more safe and secure than the normal means of communications through W.T. Messages.

Apart from these, field officers of the Headquarters and the Sector Officers of the outposts may also be provided with mobile phone connections for better and quicker means of communications.

Hence it is proposed that 10 Nos. of Fax Machine alongwith Land Line Telephone Connection may be provided to this Unit for our Out Posts having strategic importance. Also 15 Nos of Mobile Phone connections for our field Officers and Unit Hqrs. may be provided.

5 Mobile Phone Connections for the Unit Hqrs. is urgently required for interception and monitoring of Telephone messages. As per Rules 419(A) of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951 substituted by Indian Telegraph (Amendment Rule, 2007 interception of any message or class of messages under sub-section (2) of Section 5 the Indian Telegraph Act 1885 can be carried out with the prior approval of high Officials authorized by the above said Rules. For this particular purpose, every Mobile phone service providers shall designate two senior executives of the company in every licensed service area as the Nodal Officers to receive and handle such requisitions for interceptions (see Rules 419A-10 of Indian Telegraph Rules 1951). Accordingly the requisitioning security agencies shall designate one or more Nodal Officers not below the Rank of SP or Addl. SP of Police or equivalent rank to authenticate and send the requisitions for interception to the designated Officers of the concerned service provider (see Rules 419A – 9 of Indian Telegraph Rules 1951) It is a fact that with the advancement of Information Technology, even Criminal/Militants have benefited from it and utilized them for commission of offences. Sometimes the need arise for interception/monitoring of their call related information and tracking of their location which will prove very useful in Police investigation. For this purpose, this unit requires Mobile Phone Connection from all the service providers available in Mizoram with hifi Mobile handset. At present there are 4 service providers in Mizoram viz ;- BSNL, Airtel, Aircel, Reliance and some more are coming up. Hence this Unit should be well equipped to counter insurgency/Criminal with the help of these Communication gadgets.

1. **Photography and Maintenance of Records :**

At least two Digital Cameras and Video Cameras/Camcorders are required for photography and recording Law &amp; Order related incidents, meetings, criminals, etc. for the maintenance of Audio Visual Records on Major Law &amp; Order incidents, harden criminals and insurgents, collecting intelligence pertaining to mass political events, processions, meeting, rioting and crime scenes, etc.

**3. Surveillance Equipments:**

 The technical capabilities of the State Special branch need to be upgraded sufficiently to enable to encounter criminals who are also equipped with advanced equipments. In order to strengthen and streamline the State Special Branch and to keep pace with IT Revolution the following equipments may be purchased which will proved to be useful in collection of intelligence and vital information.

**Sl.no Items Model Reqd. Nos** 1 Button wireless Camera PWS-523 5 2 Wireless transmitter for

  wireless camera PWS-551/B 5

 3 UHF Pen style transmitter PWS-121 5

 4 UHF 600 hours transmitter PWS-137 5

1. Pocket size digital audio

cum video recorder 5

**4. Computers and its Accessories:**

There are at present 5 Nos of Computers (one defective) in this Unit alongwith 5 Nos of Printers and 1 Duplicating Machine as under :-

Computer and Printers – 5 Nos. (1 defective, 2 Computers are used for preparation of Daily Summary of Information, Special Report and other correspondences, 1 is used in the Account Branch for preparation of pay etc. and another 1 is used in the Confidential Branch for computerization of Confidential records.) 

This Unit is also planning to computerise various Branches like the Reserve Branch, MT Branch and Foreigners Registration/Verification Branch for the smooth functioning of Office works. As such 3 more Computers with its accessories may be provided for this purpose. 

This Office is maintaining confidential records (fact files, profiles) of militants/criminals and various organizations like political parties, Non Govt. Organization, Youths and Students Association, Labors &amp; Services Association, Drugs/Counterfeit Currency Traffickers, Arms Smugglers etc. As such it is planning to Computerise these records for the smooth functioning of this office and for easy reference in our daily activities for the safety and security of the State. For this purpose, the State Informatics Officer, National Informatics Centre (NIC), Mizoram, Aizawl was contacted and requested to develop the Software Package. Accordingly the Software was developed on the basis of Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for Record Management Information System (RMIS) and was submitted to this Office. This is an important steps towards up gradation of technology skills and capabilities of the State Special Branch. However, in order to fully implement this programme, the present holding of Computer of this Unit are inadequate and outdated to meet the requirement. This office requires five (5) more Computers along with its accessories (Four for this Software and the other for Internet Connectivity) which will be used and kept in the Confidential Branch of this Office. The above said software package is ready for use and minimum of two computers are urgently required . This requirement along with a copy of Software Requirement Specification, NIC-RMIS (Records Management Information System) for SP CID(SB), Mizoram, Aizawl prepared by NIC, Mizoram State Centre has already been submitted to PHQ.

**5. Weaponry :**

 Due to the regular movement and activities of ultras and insurgents from the neighbouring States and Countries, the Special Branch may be well equipped with the following weapons and accessories to tackle insurgency and terrorism.

a) 9 mm Sub-Machine Guns of the following type :

1) Israel made Uzi 9 mm SMG - 25 nos

2) German made MP-5 Heckler and Koch SMG -  25 nos

3) Glock 9 mm pistol - _25 nos._

 Total - **75 nos.**

b) Night Vision Goggles - 12 pairs

c) Night vision Binoculars - 12 pairs

d) Light Weight Bullet Proof Jacket - 12 nos.

**6. Enhancing Mobility/Conveyance :**

Timely and prompt collection of intelligence requires quick and fast mobility. At present CID(SB) is having 9 Nos of LMVs (Gypsy), 12 nos. of Motor Cycle and 1 Scooter, some of which are old and worn out and requires constant repair. This is inadequate to meet its basic requirement. Out of these 9 Nos. LMVs (Gypsies), 2 Nos. are old and worn out and need constant repair. They are badly required for operation duty against any subversive element threatening the security of the state and the people. For timely and prompt collection of intelligent and for carrying out successful operation, two brand new LMVs (Gypsies) may be provided to this unit to replace these two old vehicles.

The Unit is having 14 outposts mostly situated in the border areas. At present out of 14 out posts, only 7 out posts are provided with motor cycle. It may be noted that field officers and sector officers are the backbone of the State CID(SB) in collection of vital information. In the light of above, it is found that 7 (seven) motor cycles are genuinely required by this unit to facilitate quick movement of personnel in collection, collation and dissemination of information and intelligence.

Below is the list of existing vehicles in CID(SB) Unit.

**7. Off Set Printer :**

This equipment is badly required for up-gradation and enhancing intelligence capabilities of Mizoram Police in general and particularly the SB Unit.

CID (SB) used to prepare Daily Summary of Information approximately 70-100 copies in four pages of which are being circulated to high officials working under the Government of Mizoram as well as the Central Government and various other important organizations and sister intelligence agencies and 7 Sister States of the North East. The outdated system of cyclostyle operated manually with hand is still used even though we are already living in an advance age of information technology. This Office also act as Foreigner Registration Office (F.R.O.) as such several correspondences with various Central Intelligence Agencies and high officials were made on regular basis some of which are very sensitive and required prompt action. If Off Set Printer is available to us it will surely enhance efficiency and improve the standard of our DSI publication etc. and also the Pay Bill forms, FIR forms, question papers for Departmental Examinations/Recruitment of Police etc. can be printed in bulk quantities within a very short period of time. The Off Set may be kept in CID(SB) Office since this office is in need of it for printing the Daily Summary of Information (DSI) etc. The other Units and PHQ may avail the facility when required.

**PROPOSAL FOR PROCUREMENT OF EQUIPMENTS ETC. FOR CID(SB)**

1. **Communication :**

This unit is having 14 Out Posts mostly situated in the border areas. Up-gradation by means of communication between the Sector Officers of this Out Posts and the Headquarters is the urgent need of this Unit. Information and Intelligence, etc. are sent to the Hqrs. through W.T. Messages which are not found safe and secure. There is often delay in transmission of this messages which requires prompts supervision and direction from the Hqrs. It is, therefore, felt necessary to install telephone (Land Line) connection along with Fax Machines in CID (SB) Out Posts where these facilities are available. At present out of these 14 Out Posts, only Vairengte SB post is provided with telephone (Land Line) facility. It is proposed that telephone connection along with Fax Machines may be provided in the Out Posts, having strategic importance to facilitate quicker means of communicating vital intelligence and informations, etc. which will be more safe and secure than the normal means of communications through W.T. Messages.

Apart from these, field officers of the Headquarters and the Sector Officers of the outposts may also be provided with mobile phone connections for better and quicker means of communications.

Hence it is proposed that 10 Nos. of Fax Machine alongwith Land Line Telephone Connection may be provided to this Unit for our Out Posts having strategic importance. Also 15 Nos of Mobile Phone connections for our field Officers and Unit Hqrs. may be provided.

5 Mobile Phone Connections for the Unit Hqrs. is urgently required for interception and monitoring of Telephone messages.

For this particular purpose, every Mobile phone service providers shall designate two senior executives of the company in every licensed service area as the Nodal Officers to receive and handle such requisitions for interceptions (see Rules 419A-10 of Indian Telegraph Rules 1951). Accordingly the requisitioning security agencies shall designate one or more Nodal Officers not below the Rank of SP or Addl. SP of Police or equivalent rank to authenticate and send the requisitions for interception to the designated Officers of the concerned service provider (see Rules 419A – 9 of Indian Telegraph Rules 1951) It is a fact that with the advancement of Information Technology, even Criminal/Militants have benefited from it and utilized them for commission of offences. Sometimes the need arise for interception/monitoring of their call related information and tracking of their location which will prove very useful in Police investigation. For this purpose, this unit requires Mobile Phone Connection from all the service providers available in Mizoram with hifi Mobile handset. At present there are 4 service providers in Mizoram viz ;- BSNL, Airtel, Aircel, Reliance and some more are coming up. Hence this Unit should be well equipped to counter insurgency/Criminal with the help of these Communication gadgets.

**4. Computers and its Accessories:**

There are at present 5 Nos of Computers (one defective) in this Unit alongwith 5 Nos of Printers and 1 Duplicating Machine as under :-

Computer and Printers – 5 Nos. (1 defective, 2 Computers are used for preparation of Daily Summary of Information, Special Report and other correspondences, 1 is used in the Account Branch for preparation of pay etc. and another 1 is used in the Confidential Branch for computerization of Confidential records.) 

This Unit is also planning to computerise various Branches like the Reserve Branch, MT Branch and Foreigners Registration/Verification Branch for the smooth functioning of Office works. As such 3 more Computers with its accessories may be provided for this purpose. 

This Office is maintaining confidential records (fact files, profiles) of militants/criminals and various organizations like political parties, Non Govt. Organization, Youths and Students Association, Labors &amp; Services Association, Drugs/Counterfeit Currency Traffickers, Arms Smugglers etc. As such it is planning to Computerise these records for the smooth functioning of this office and for easy reference in our daily activities for the safety and security of the State. For this purpose, the State Informatics Officer, National Informatics Centre (NIC), Mizoram, Aizawl was contacted and requested to develop the Software Package. Accordingly the Software was developed on the basis of Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for Record Management Information System (RMIS) and was submitted to this Office. This is an important steps towards up gradation of technology skills and capabilities of the State Special Branch. However, in order to fully implement this programme, the present holding of Computer of this Unit are inadequate and outdated to meet the requirement. This office requires five (5) more Computers along with its accessories (Four for this Software and the other for Internet Connectivity) which will be used and kept in the Confidential Branch of this Office. The above said software package is ready for use and minimum of two computers are urgently required . This requirement along with a copy of Software Requirement Specification, NIC-RMIS (Records Management Information System) for SP CID(SB), Mizoram, Aizawl prepared by NIC, Mizoram State Centre has already been submitted to PHQ.

1) Israel made Uzi 9 mm SMG - 25 nos

2) German made MP-5 Heckler and Koch SMG -  25 nos

3) Glock 9 mm pistol - _25 nos._

 Total - **75 nos.**

b) Night Vision Goggles - 12 pairs

c) Night vision Binoculars - 12 pairs

d) Light Weight Bullet Proof Jacket - 12 nos.

**6. Enhancing Mobility/Conveyance :**

Timely and prompt collection of intelligence requires quick and fast mobility. At present CID(SB) is having 9 Nos of LMVs (Gypsy), 12 nos. of Motor Cycle and 1 Scooter, some of which are old and worn out and requires constant repair. This is inadequate to meet its basic requirement. Out of these 9 Nos. LMVs (Gypsies), 2 Nos. are old and worn out and need constant repair. They are badly required for operation duty against any subversive element threatening the security of the state and the people. For timely and prompt collection of intelligent and for carrying out successful operation, two brand new LMVs (Gypsies) may be provided to this unit to replace these two old vehicles.

The Unit is having 14 outposts mostly situated in the border areas. At present out of 14 out posts, only 7 out posts are provided with motor cycle. It may be noted that field officers and sector officers are the backbone of the State CID(SB) in collection of vital information. In the light of above, it is found that 7 (seven) motor cycles are genuinely required by this unit to facilitate quick movement of personnel in collection, collation and dissemination of information and intelligence.

Below is the list of existing vehicles in CID(SB) Unit.

**7. Off Set Printer :**

This equipment is badly required for up-gradation and enhancing intelligence capabilities of Mizoram Police in general and particularly the SB Unit.

CID (SB) used to prepare Daily Summary of Information approximately 70-100 copies in four pages of which are being circulated to high officials working under the Government of Mizoram as well as the Central Government and various other important organizations and sister intelligence agencies and 7 Sister States of the North East. The outdated system of cyclostyle operated manually with hand is still used even though we are already living in an advance age of information technology. This Office also act as Foreigner Registration Office (F.R.O.) as such several correspondences with various Central Intelligence Agencies and high officials were made on regular basis some of which are very sensitive and required prompt action. If Off Set Printer is available to us it will surely enhance efficiency and improve the standard of our DSI publication etc. and also the Pay Bill forms, FIR forms, question papers for Departmental Examinations/Recruitment of Police etc. can be printed in bulk quantities within a very short period of time. The Off Set may be kept in CID(SB) Office since this office is in need of it for printing the Daily Summary of Information (DSI) etc. The other Units and PHQ may avail the facility when required.
