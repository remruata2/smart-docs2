**CYMA checked Rangvamual & Phunchawng**: After CYMA’s deadline for Myanmarese families and those indulged in illicit liquor factories to leave Rangvamual and Phunchawng localites, most Myanmarese families obeyed and had left while several liquor sellers still have not left.

 As reported by CYMA Gen. Secy. Vanlalruata, leaders of CYMA were divided into two groups to check the condition of Rangvamual and Phunchawng and found a number of liquor sellers who have not left; these people thought only Myanmarese in illicit liquor factories were to leave. CYMA explained to them that not only Myanmarese but anyone involved in illicit liquor factories is to leave the localities and informed them to leave.
