****Notes on entry/exit points along Indo-Myanmar Border (IMB) as on Dt.25.2.25****

_FMR New Guidelines (Free Movement Limit On Indo-Myanmar Border Tightened to 10_

_Km, With Border Pass) :_

The Indian government has introduced new regulations to oversee movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). On December 24, 2024, the MHA announced a revised protocol that decreases the Free Movement Regime (FMR) range, shrinking it from 16 km to 10 km. Despite Union Home Minister Amit Shah's earlier statement in February of the previous year, suggesting the FMR would be abolished, a formal notification has yet to be issued.

Security along the 510-km border has been intensified, and now residents residing within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border must secure a Border Pass for travel. This Border Pass permits a stay of up to seven days and is provided to both Indian and Myanmar citizens who present documentation verifying their residency within the 10-km zone. Effective from December 31, enforcement is executed by State Police, Assam Rifles, and Health Officials at major entry and exit points. Individuals crossing the border will undergo document scrutiny by the Assam Rifles, followed by security and health evaluations by local authorities. The Assam Rifles will record biometrics and issue a Border Pass featuring a QR code and photograph. Non-compliance with the new movement regulations will lead to legal repercussions, with physical verifications in place to ensure adherence. The crossing points will be operational from Monday to Saturday, between 6:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.

The new regulations restrict the movement of individuals from 16 km under the previous FMR to 10 km now, on either side. Only those residing in the "border area" —defined as within 10 km on either side— are eligible to apply for the "Border Pass" for up to a seven-day stay; such pass-holders are required to return it at the same crossing point where it was issued. Residents of villages beyond the "border areas" (the 10-km zone) and citizens of any third country are ineligible for the Border Pass.

**PILOT PROJECT**:

A border pass will be issued to only one adult, and minors (under 18 years of age) must be accompanied by a parent. The details for up to three children can be included in a single border pass belonging to either parent; a separate border pass is required for more than three minors.

Proof of identity can be provided by the station house officer of the local police station or a person of equivalent rank in Myanmar, as well as by a local village chief or village authority, certifying that the applicant resides in the village situated within the 10-kilometer "border area" on either side. This proof of identity document is valid for one year. These new guidelines will takes effect from 30.12.2024, at Zokhawthar and Hnahlan, located in Champhai District, along the Mizoram-Myanmar border and till 29.01.2025, the number of person entered from Myanmar to India is 1745 and India to Myanmar is 34 at Zokhawthar, person entered from Myanmar to India is 22 and India to Myanmar is 16 at Hnahlan. The Zokhawthar and nahlan is pilot site for new entry and Exit point.

**PHASE-I**

PHASE-I of Entry and Exit point along with Indo-Myanmar Border in Mizoram is supposed to start from 23.1.2025 in these places:-

| **S/No** | **District** | **Name of Crossing Points** | **Closest BP** | **Closest COB** |

| 2 | Lawngtlai | Hruitezawl | BP – 08 | COB Zorinpui/20AR |
| 3 | Lawngtlai | Laitlang | BP – 08 | COB Zorinpui/20AR |


But the identified check gates in each of these areas is deemed too far from the villages and a meeting on 21.01.2025 at 05:15 pm held under the chairmanship of Secretary(BM), MHA on the entry/Exit points along Indo-Myanmar Border(IBM) resolved that it must be re-verified. After the verification, the same duty point for Entry/Exit point as proposed is approved and SP Lawntlai posted 2 police personnel in each of these 3 places.
