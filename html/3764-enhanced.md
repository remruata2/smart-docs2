****BRIEF NOTE ON THE ISSUES OF BRU REFUGEES & REPATRIATION PROCESS****

**HISTORY**

The Brus also called Reangs are the Nomadic Tribe living in the western belt of Mizoram, bordering Bangladesh and Tripura State. The Brus started entering into Mizoram around 1940's and engaged themselves in jhum cultivation. The Brus were living in 14 villages in Kolasib District, 11 villages in Lunglei District and 46 villages in Mamit District and spread over 9 Assembly Constituencies (i.e. Hachhek, Dampa, Mamit, Tuirial, Kolasib, Serlui, Lunglei South, Thorang and West Tuipui)

 A militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) formed in 1996 under the leadership of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news of the killing spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by Bru National Union (BNU). Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram towards Tripura.

The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps (Kaiskau, Khakchangpara, Hamsapara, Naisingpara, Asapara, Hazacherra) and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government. The Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum (MBDPF), headquartered at the Naisingpara camp on the eastern side of the Jampui Hills is an apex body for Brus living in 6 (six) refugees camps in Tripura. The Forum was created in 2002.

After a number of meetings between the Centre and the State authorities were held, date for repatriation of the Bru refugees was fixed i.e. 16th November, 2009. While all preparations for repatriation process were going on smoothly a Bru militant group who called themselves the Bru Revolutionary Union (BRU) killed a Mizo youth Zarzokima (17), on 13th November, 2009. It was later confirmed that killing was done deliberately by the BRU in order to deter the repatriation process.

Different armed groups which were formed by the Brus - BNA/BRA, BNLF or BLFM and BNCT are not active anymore. However, one group, Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM) was again formed under the patronage of NLFT. These BDFM cadres are the remnants of the then BLFM who refused to surrender at the time of the latter's mass surrender on 26.10.2006.

**QUADRIPARTITE AGREEMENT**

**1)** Bru Refugee Repatriation agreement was made by the Central Government, Government of Mizoram, Government of Tripura and the Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples' Forum (MBDPF) on 2.7.2018.

**2)** However, this Quadripartite Agreement was later opposed by different sections of the Bru society and formed various organizations to derail the repatriation Viz. EPDC (Equal Package Demand Committee), MBRPAIDC (Mizoram Bru Returnees' Peace Accords Implementing Demand Committee), and MBDPCC (Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples' Coordination Committee).

**3)** These Bru organizations, so as to prevent the repatriation at all cost, keeps on making fresh demands some of which are completely unacceptable by the Mizo community, for instance, the creation of Autonomous District Council for Brus.****

**PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE SUCCESS OF BRU REPATRIATION**

**1.**  Different organization of Mizoram insisted on repatriating Mizoram Brus origin only, which can be traced from the records of **Mizoram Electoral Roll of 1995** and their genuine descendants.

**2.**  Educated and enlightened leaders of Brus, insisted at all cost, to prevent the repatriation as they are benefited by their fellow Brus being given a refugee status. Donations/Contributions so collected amounted to huge amount which are worth something greatly desirable by those in high position. Hence, demanding various points completely unacceptable by Mizo community and even the government, most notably having Autonomous District Council of Brus.

****3.**  While these are the purviews of both the Brus and the Mizo communities, solving the Bru Crisis is an important agenda for the Central Government as the Brus, who have settled in Mizoram (India) before Independence have to be considered as Indian Citizens with Minority Status in the State of Mizoram.**
