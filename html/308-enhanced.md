****EXAMINATION OF CREDENTIALS OF V.MALSAWMDAWNGLIANA, H/NO.E-58, CHANMARI, V.NEIHKUNGA BUILDING****

Mr. V Malsawmdawngliana is a reputed businessman who runs the Modicare Service centre, located at Zarkawt. He is also dealer of Dalmia Cement Company and distributor of Nokia phones. His Modicare service centre is the main office in Aizawl where new products are introduced and conferences were held for various consultants under Modicare Company. He, being an experienced businessman, was introduced to Modicare by his friend from Nagaland who is a Nokia distributor there in 2012. Since then, he has been running the Modicare service centre as well as warehouse for stocking all products of Modicare at their office at Zarkawt. But from 2018, due to the massive increase in demand of the company's product in Mizoram it became difficult to run both the service centre and the warehouse in one location. As a result, the company decided to look for another partner to look after stocking of product and running a warehouse in Aizawl.

Therefore, in 2018, the company made an agreement with TVS Logistics, which is a third party logistics company, to locate a suitable warehouse and hire manpower to take up stocking of products. From June 2019, Mr. V Malsawmdawngliana was relieved from his previous responsibility of stocking the product. He runs Modicare service centre alone at his store at Zarkawt.
