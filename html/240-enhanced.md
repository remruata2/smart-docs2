As per the about reference order number, assessment of security threat in respect of Pu R.Lalzirliana, Ex-Home Minister, Armed Veng North and Pu Hiphei, Ex-Speaker, Tuikhuahtlang, Mizoram were conducted and following sources, contacts, informants and operatives were approached.

 Presently, they have four PSOs respectively. It is learnt that several precautionary advices are being received from known persons and also from unknown persons as they were just inducted by MNF party and BJP party. They were offered to look after Tawi and Palak MLA constituency. They sometimes felt a sense of uneasiness and discomfort towards their safety and that of their family.

 Upon further enquiry, the said Ex-MLAs had neither received any direct or indirect life threatening words nor received any threat report from their staffs. Their constituencies are presently peaceful and there is no critical polling station in the said constituencies.

 Taking into account the security threat that could emanates from different angles, it is concluded that the threat perceived either direct or indirect is minimal at present. But the nature of thier presence situation, the possibility of a security breach and in order to enable them to move freely without fear, it is most suitable that they may retained two PSO out of the present four Personal Security Officers (PSO).
