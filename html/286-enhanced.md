Subj :-  Assessment of Security Threat on ISPW establishment at New Capital Complex, Aizawl

Ref : No. PHQ/OPS-10/Misc/2018/76 Dt.26th March 2019

Sir,

 In compliance to your letter no. mentioned above, assessment of security threat on ISPW establishment at New Capital Complex, Aizawl was conducted.

As a result of the assessment, it was found that the ISPW at New Capital Complex is presently manned by Jt. Asst. Director – Rakhesh Kumar along with 15 other personnel. It was also found that this ISPW did not receive any direct or indirect threat and that the need for security personnel was made purely on the basis that every ISPW establishment have a 24hrs duty throughout their establishment in India.The ISPW establishment at New Capital Complex presently have a two personnel night duty from 1st Bn. MAP from 6:00 pm in the evening to 6:00am in the morning.

 In the light of the above and the impending Lok Sabha election process, where police personnel are stretch to the limit, it is felt unnecessary to provide another security to this ISPW.

 Submitted for favour of information and further necessary action please.

 Yours faithfully,

** (K.LALREMSANGA)**
