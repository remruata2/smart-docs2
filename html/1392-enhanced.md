****STATUS REPORT OF BRU REFUGEES VIS A VIS REPATRIATION PROCESS**  **

 The Brus also called Riangs are the Nomadic Tribe living in the western belt of Mizoram, bordering Bangladesh and Tripura State. As far as history goes the Brus started entering into Mizoram around 1940's moving from one place to another for jhum cultivation.

 Political awareness gradually emerged amongst the Brus and formed a political party called Riang Democratic Party in June, 1990. At the same time Bru Student Association and Bru Welfare Committee were also formed to promote the welfare of Brus in Mizoram. In 1994 the RDP, BSA and BWC at a joint conference formed a new political party called the Bru National Union(BNU) by merging the three organisations. The BNU conference held in September, 1997 at Saipuilui village in Mamit District adopted a resolution for creation of Autonomous District Council for Brus in the western part of Mizoram which was strongly objected by the Mizo community in the concerned area. At the same time a militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) which was formed in 1996 under the leadership of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became more and more active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news about the killing had spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by BNU. Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram at the instance of the BNLF for their operational convenience.

 The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government.

 After a number of meetings between the Centre and the State authorities were held, date for repatriation of the Bru refugees was fixed i.e. 16th November, 2009. While all preparations for repatriation process were going on smoothly a Bru militant group who called themselves the Bru Revolutionary Union (BRU) killed a Mizo youth on 13th November, 2009. It was later confirmed that killing was done deliberately by the BRU in order to deter the repatriation process.

 Even though the killers of the innocent Mizo youth left a note with a letter head 'Bru Revolutionary Union', subsequent investigation and statement given by persons involved in this murder case revealed that there is no such organisation as 'BRU' but a group of Bru miscreants who had been instigated by some section of MBDPF leaders to derail the repatriation process who did such heinous crime. Nevertheless, there are two known armed groups who operated in the Mizoram-Tripura border and Mizoram-Assam border who had secret understanding with some leaders of MBDPF who could be utilised when the need arise. The existence of these armed groups was revealed based on the revelation made by one of their leaders arrested by Mizoram Police named Henry recently. Reliable information received stated that this very group are the one who gave warning to refugees not to obey the Govt's plan of repatriation and who instilled fears amongst the Bru Refugees.

**PROCESSION**

 On15.12.2017, around 1500 members of Brus living in different Refugee Camps within North Tripura took out a procession under the aegis of Joint NGO Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples' Forum (MDPF). They marched from Naisingpara Camp and Ashapara Camp to RD Block, Dasda, Kanchanpur. They chanted slogans and carried placards written 'We are Indian, We love Peace', 'Distribute immediate Cash Dole for Five months’, 'Avoid forceful repatriation, Don't do forceful repatriation', etc.
