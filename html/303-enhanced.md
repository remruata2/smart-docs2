Subject: Issue of prohibited bore arm license.

Ref: Memo No.L.14012/1(Aizawl)/2014-HMA/7 dt.10.5.2014.

Sir,

 With reference to the above, I am to state that discreet threat perception assessment was conducted regarding issuance of prohibited bore arm license to Pi L.Tochhong, Chief Secretary, Mizoram. In the course of stringent assessment conducted, no specific/imminent threat has been perceived. However, it is a fact that Pi L.Tochhong, IAS holds top bureaucratic post in Govt. of Mizoram and considering her retirement life. It is advisable and recommended that she may keep a prohibited bore arms for her self defence and security.

 Submitted for favour of kind information and necessary action.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
