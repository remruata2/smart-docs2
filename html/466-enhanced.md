****STATEMENT OF JOSEPH LALNUNMAWIA (31)****

****S/0 VANLALROMAWIA, RAMHLUN VENGTHAR****

 The following Statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief. I am a Male Nurse. I worked at Synod Hospital, Durtlang till 2017 after which I shifted to LRM Hospital, Ramhlun at which I am working till date.

 Pu V. Lalfakzuala, who did not even know my name and occupation clearly, had mentioned my name in his letter to the President of India because of which I was summoned to CID (SB) office. At first, I could not remember Pu Faka clearly but was able to recall him after his stay at Durtlang Hospital was mentioned.

 Pu V Lalfakzuala immediately identified me as John upon seeing me. Although I told him that my name is Joseph Lalnunmawia, he insisted that John is my name. While I was working at Durtlang Hospital, he was admitted there due to some gastric problem. As I recall, his children used to attend to him and we even cared for him very much. He was able to recall the name of my colleagues viz. Loisy Lalchhandami, Elizabeth Remsangzuali and Lalthlamuanpuii @ Tetei.

 At first, I was very angry that he had accused me of having sex with Loisy and Elizabeth on Dt. 9/3/2017 and 6/5/2017. Since I was a married man and he had accused me of abusing my status as senior nurse, I was very hurt. However, when he claimed that the female nurses love him very much, I knew that he was mentally ill. When he mentioned that I refused to return his greeting near the Hospital Restaurant B, I am convinced that he was mentally ill and I refused to take whatever he said seriously. Even at the CID Office, I was very furious at first but I was able to calm down after realizing he was just ranting around. I was received politely at CID Office. , CID (SB) staff or Pu Maliana did not use any impolite language or intimidating words and he was not physically assaulted in any way. I left from the office in the evening without any issue.

 However, it is irritating that he has continued to trouble us and I am contemplating making a complaint in Court.

STATEMENT OF SI J.H CHUNGLIANTHANGA, CID (SB)

MIZORAM, AIZAWL

My name and particulars are as stated above. Reference Order No. MSB/CB/B-61/40 Dt. 16/1/2018, inquiry was done regarding a letter sent to the President of India by a man who has given his name as ‘Hminga Pa’. As per instruction from superior officers, inquiry was first done at Synod Hospital, Durtlang, after which the sender of the letter, Mr. V. Lalfakzuala was summoned and examined as per legal procedure.

According to the statements of Synod Hospital officials, Mr. V. Lalfakzuala was an in-patient on 23/12/2010 and 17/8/2016 and he was given treatment for gastric problems. All the staff nurses who attended to him viz. Loisy, Elizabeth, Tetei, Tei, Esther and Ruthi were also thoroughly examined but they denied all allegations of having sex as mentioned in the letter.

According to patient record file, V. Lalfakzuala is a resident of Govt. Complex, Luangmual Veng and he was a Sub-Inspector rank officer who went on voluntary retirement in 2015 due to mental illness. After obtaining his phone number and his service records from 3IR Bn., he was requested to appear at CID (SB) office. However, he declined the request stating that he will not appear without proper summons. Hence he was served summons by Pu Lalbiakzauva, DySP(Field).

As per instruction from superior officers, Pu Faka was picked up from his residence with the help of police personnel of Zonuam Outpost. He was brought to Zonuam Outpost where his specimen handwriting was taken for handwriting identification. After that, he was brought to CID (SB) office. As indicated in the Summon No.91/160, Pu Faka was interrogated/examined at the office field room. He staed that his wife committed adultery, that the nurses- Loisy, Elizabeth and Tetei loved him very much but had to say ‘Bye Bye forever’ due to interference of John. During his interrogation, CID (SB) staff did not use any impolite language or intimidating words and he was not physically assaulted in any way. Since it was evident that he was mentally disturbed, it was felt there was no need to carry on the investigation any further.

Since all the CID (SB) field officers who examined Pu Faka were convinced that he was mentally ill, we consider the investigation to be completed. Further, the male nurse Joseph Lalnunmawia who was summoned to the office also stated that the accusations of Pu Faka that he slept with the nurses was a lie and that since he is a married man, it was very embarrassing for him. Although Joseph was very furious at the beginning, he quickly understood that Pu Faka was mentally ill and hence he was actually sympathetic towards him at the end.

We even made an apology to all the victims of the false accusations – the female nurses, the male nurse and the Hospital authorities on behalf of Pu V Lalfakzuala. The Hospital authorities were very offended as they felt the accusations gave a bad name and very disreputable for the name of the hospital. However, they did not take any action after we explained that it was an action of a person who was mentally ill.

On the day 18/1/2018, Mr. V Lalfakzuala was released from the office in the evening without any issue and inquiry report was duly prepared and submitted to Dy. SP (Field). I am very disappointed that Pu V Lalfakzuala, who is considered by the public to be a mentally ill person, could create so much trouble for the police.
