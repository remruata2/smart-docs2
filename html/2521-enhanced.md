Information received stated that Pu C. Vanlalzawma of Bairabi, Kolasib district (ph-8974419602) has seen 5 (five) small motorized boats boarded by around 50 (fifty) Assam Police personnel and proceeded upstream at Tlawng River near Bairabi town today @ 2:40 p.m. The Police party also carried plastic water tank (sintex, 1000 litres) and some bags of rice along with them and they further proceeds towards Teirei river.

In this connection, OC Bairabi PS immediately contacted OC Ramnathpur PS, Assam and enquired about the movement of Assam Police personnel in Tlawng River. OC Ramnathpur PS clarified that Assam Police personnel are carrying essential supply items for Assam Police BOP located at Gutguthi, Hailakandi district, Assam (near Saikhawthlir, Mamit District) by using small boats in Tlawng River. OC Bairabi requested OC Ramnathpur to give advance intimation regarding movement of security personnel in the border area as movement of security personnel caused panic amongst the general public. Mizoram Police personnel who are on duty at various places along Assam-Mizoram border are alerted and directed to keep vigil on any movement of troops in the border area.

Information received further stated that Assam police personnel used river route for supplying essential items to Assam Police Gutguti BOP due to COVID-19 pandemic instead of using the main road which passed through Bairaibi town.

  Situation is under close watch.
