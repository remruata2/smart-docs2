Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, I am sending the required information as under.

 **DISTRICT** **REMARKS**

1. AIZAWL Out of 23 MRB branches, only Suangpuilawn and Ratu are found vulnerable since no security arrangement currently made by the bank.

2. KOLASIB Security provided by the government for all the MRB branches within Kolasib district seems to be good enough at present.

3. CHAMPHAI Out of 9 MRB branches in Champhai district, only Kawlkulh and Ngopa are having security guards and the rest seems to be not secured by deployment of security guards and it may be mentioned that deployment of bank guards for each of the Rural Banks with CCTVs and installation of foot operated alarm system in each Rural Bank is of utmost necessity.
