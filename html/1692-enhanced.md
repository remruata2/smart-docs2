Subj:  Assessment of threat perception.

Sir,

 With reference to your Order No.MSB/CB/B-19(A)/07 dt.13/5/2015, I had conducted assessment on threat perceived with regard to Pi L.Tochhawng, State Election Commissioner. While conducting assessment on threat perceived, effort was rendered from different possible angles to ascertain possible threat posed or perceived upon the said person. However, the threat level perceived, be it from insurgent groups or NGOs, Student bodies or Civil organizations, Govt. Employees Association or even that could emanates due to personal animosity against her is minimal. It may also be mentioned that at present 2 PSOs are being deployed for the said protected person.

   

 Yours faithfully,

SI(JOHNNY RENGSI)
