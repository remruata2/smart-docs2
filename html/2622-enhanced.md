They went to Tahan, Myanmar where his two acquaintances obtained the weapons and ammunitions. From Tahan, the consignment was carried on foot by the accused with two other persons named Thangtinkhuma of Tahan and Tinlianpianga of Pidota, Myanmar towards Tlangsam village, Champhai District in Mizoram, the outskirts of which was their rendezvous point with Laltea and Hrangthanga and where the consignment was to be handed over to them. But on reaching the outskirt of Tlangsam village, the run into the YMA duty from Tlangsam village, his two partners fled while he was apprehended with all the items.
