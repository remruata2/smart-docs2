****SPECIAL REPORT****

No. MSB/CB/SR/2021/625

Dated: 13th Aug, 2021

 Information received stated that Assam started construction of bridge (which appears to be Bailey bridge) near the existing bamboo bridge across Saihapui V river w.e.f. 11.8.2021 which will connect Pu Chalchhunga farm land to Pu Lalnuntluanga farm land, both inside Mizoram. The bridge construction site is located at around 100 metres towards north-east from Mizoram Armed Police duty post, located beside Saihapui V river. It may be mentioned in this regard that Assam Police are presently being deployed at the 2 (two) stated farm lands. The said construction work is clear violation of the Joint Statement issued by representatives of Mizoram and Assam on 5.8.2021 as it could disrupt peace and harmony amongst the people living in the area.
The above construction has been opposed by residents of Buarchep and Phainuam and in this regard, some residents of the two villages pelted stones towards the construction site yesterday i.e., 12.8.2021. The construction work is currently being underway.
