 During the course of threat assessment, sources and contacts, links and informants from insurgent groups having operating area adjoining to the interstate and international border were contacted besides constantly monitoring their activities and movements. Despite the existence and presence of several insurgent groups having base and operating areas alongside interstate and international border, it is learnt that at this moment none of these underground insurgents pose any threat to disrupt or thwart the scheduled celebration of the said National Day. It is also further learnt that the threat perceived as against various protected persons of the state Government from insurgent groups is minimal at the moment. Impending issues undertaken by NGOs, student bodies, civil society organisation were also taken into account.

 It is concluded that the threat perceived as against various protected persons of the state government as well as the venues for the proposed National Day from insurgent groups, NGOs, student bodies, civil society organisations, political rivalry or even from personal animosity is considered minimal at the moment.
