Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, I am submitting the required information on Point No.16 as under :

 "So far, no formal guidelines has been laid down/issued by the State Government regarding the use of drones and in case of certain situations such as National Day, visit of VVIP, border dispute etc. the State Police Administration has given recommendations/suggestions to issue prohibition order for use of drones in certain areas to the concerned Authorities, and accordingly issued prohibition order for a specified time. It may be mentioned that being a peaceful state, the State Police Administration has not yet laid down any specific guidelines for use of drones. However, the State Police Administration is constantly monitoring any possible threats pose by the use of drones."
