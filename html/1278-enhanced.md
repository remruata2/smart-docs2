I, Mohammad SayadHussain(30) S/o ShayaibHussain, R/o Magura, MaguraDistrict of Bangladesh studied upto Class 5 from Brack School from my village. After that, I worked as a labourer in our own agricultural land. In 2016,I came to Gazipur, Dhaka in search of work. I then rented a room at Gazipur and worked as a helper in some construction works and earned about 400 Taka per day.

 It was during the month of May, 2016, I met with one Bashir Ahmad, R/o Faridpur District, Bangladesh. He was a Mason by profession and used to visit Gazipurlabour market in search of work. There was a Mosque at the Gazipur market where along with Bashir, we do used to offer Namaz (prayer) together and had some normal conversation and Salam Dua (Remembrance)etc.

 At first Bashir offered me to work with himand after I accepted the offer I began to work under him at construction sites. I had developed a good relation with Bashir and after 2/3 months, Bashir began to talk and introduced me with regard to Islam and Jihadetc. and my interest in Islamic studies grew more and more.

 I was deeply influenced by Bashir’s Islamic instructions and remarks that Jihad is a necessary part of Islam and every Muslims duty is to join Jihad for the sake of Allah. After quite some time, Bashir asked my opinion about joining any Jihadi organization for the sake of Allah to which I replied that I wanted to join such organization that works for the establishment of Jihadi group and Deen (Muslims way of life) in the land of Allah

.

 After four months, in the month of February 2017, Bashir gave me a dawat (invitation) to join **Ansar-Al-Islam**, as this organization works for Jihad. I had accepted the offer after which Bashir taught me several intelligence related and secure communication techniques. I was trained and instructed to become familiar with Protected Text (PT) Chat, a secure means of communication. Bashir had created PT Text ID and password for me to enable me to use the said secure communication application to ensure constant communication with him.

In the month of June 2017, Bashir told me to take rent a room at Kachpur, PS Sonargaon, Narayanganj District, Bangladesh, for training purposes. I then rented a room at the rate of 2000 Taka per month. After about 15 days, Bashir came and met me at Kachpur. After two days, one Abdulla (Address not known) joined me for training. This was all organized by Bashir.

 Bashir gave us training on sketching and drawing of maps,map reading techniques to identify locations and target area, recce techniques, working of CCTV, security operation procedures, security positions and arrangements of any target locations. It was during the later part of the training that Bashir brought one pistol (name/model not known) with 17 rounds and taught us how to handle and use it. We kept the pistol with us in our rented house uptill the end of the training. After the training,we all parted and too went back to Gazipur. We get communicated by means of Protected text message.

 In August 2017, Bashir instructed me to get prepare for some assignment in India and told me to prepare a fake Aadhar Card. For the preparation of the fake Aadhar Card, I travelled to Mirpur, Dhaka, which is known for making fake Indian documents. I managed to obtain fake/forged Indian Aadhar Card for me by the name of ShohanMolla S/o SanowarMolla of Khorda, Hasnabad, 24 Parganas, West Bengal_(forged Indian Aadhar Card no.958136395645_). I then stayed at Mirpur to and wait for Bashir’s instruction, meanwhile I was engaged in daily labour work.

After almost a year, Bashir instructed me to cross Indo-Bangladesh border from Kasba-Kamalasagar border as for which he had handed me a sum of Rs.15,000.

 It was during the first week of **October 2018** that I had entered into Indian territory from Kasba-Kamalasagar(Indo-Bangla border) by evading BGB and BSF guards at the border and reached Agartala. On reachingAgartala, I then rented a room at **Ramnagar area of Agartala**at Rs. 1500 per month and started selling Amra (Hog Plum), Pitha(Rice Cake), etc. for the next 3 months.

 After remaining at Agartala for about 3 months, Bashir had instructed me to resettleinDharmanagar, North Tripura citing security reasons. I then shifted to Dharmanagar, North Tripura and again rented a room at Botorosi area, Dharmanagar, at Rs. 1500/- per month(Abdul House).RifatRehan and me were stayed together in Dharmanagr for more than a month for area familiarization of Belonia,Kamarpur,Kailashpur, Agartala and Karimganj of Assam. Later on RifatRehan left for Bangladesh.

While staying in Dharmanagar, Bashir had told me to visit Mizoram. It was during my stay in Dharmanagar that I had asked Bashir to deliver some money. Bashir then made arrangement to collect a sum of Rs.21,000 from an unknown person at CNG Station, near Agartala Railway Station for which I collected accordingly.

 It was during late April 2019 that Bashir had instructed me again to shift to Kanchanpur, NorthTripura,which was close to Mizoram. On reaching Kanchanpur I rented a room at LalMia’s house @ Rs. 1500/- per month. After staying after about one month in Kanchanpur, I again urged Bashir to provide me some money for which he again made arrangement and I received Rs. 20000/- at Masjid in Bishalgarh, Agartala from unknown person.

 Bashir then instructed me to find a suitable place in Mizoram border area where we could settle and further directed me to find arms smugglers who could provide us with arms and ammunitions for our organization ie, **Ansar-Al-Islam**. As per instructions of Bashir, I used to buy new mobile phones every time he changed his locations, and also bought new pre-activated forged Sim cards from Agartala market at high price.

On 19th July’ 2019, I came alone in Mizoram upto Rajiv Nagar and stayed in the house of one Chakma (name not known) for a night, but as I could not find any suitable place for my immediate accommodation, I then went back to Kanchanpur

On 21st July, 2019 as per instruction of Bashir, I went down to Dharmanagar and received one Mahmud Hassanabout at Dharmanagar Railway Station. Bashir had told me in detail about what would be the attire of Mahmud Hassan so that I could be able to identify him. After finding Mahmud Hassan, we left for Kanchanpur.

On 25th July’ 2019, upon receiving instruction from Bashir, we proceeded to Rajiv Nagar, Mizoram and stayed at Tourist Lodge for one night. The next day, as we missed missed the Maxicab service for West Phaileng, we then decided to go to West Phaileng via Marpara. We then contacted one boatman who could drop us to Marpara and found one boatman who charged us@ Rs. 500/- per head. The boatman then took usuptoSilsuri only. We stayed at the boatman’s house as there was no hotel or Rest House at Silsuri.

I used 4(four)protectedtext user ID and made all secret communications with Boshir, AshafaqBhai(to report about expenditure details), Jamil (in Boshir absence) and I remembered only the two user ID &amp; password_( i.e User ID-golapi90 with password - shonibar09, User ID-!fona@r?? with password -!fon@ar.., )_

On 27thJuly,2019, we went to Marpara by another boat. At Marpara, we met with one businessman from Silchar who told us whether we possessed any ILP pass or not as it is mandatory to enter Mizoram. We again took a boat for Silsuri. On reaching Silsuri, we could not find any boat bound for Rajiv Nagar. We then decided to stay at Silsuri, but since nobody were willing to accommodate us in their houses, we were told to meet with the Village Chief. The Village Chief brought in BSF officials and after they interrogated us, they felt suspicious of our behavior and handed us over to the MarparaPolice on 29th July’ 2019
