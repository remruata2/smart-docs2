****BORDER ISSUE****

Mizoram is having approximately 404 kms. and 318 kms. porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively. It has boundary of 123 kms with Assam, 66 Kms with Tripura and 95 Kms with Manipur. Security Border of Mizoram is entrusted mainly with Mizoram Police with sister agencies namely, Assam Rifles, Border Security Force and Central Reserve Police Force

****BORDER ISSUES WITH ASSAM****

**Historical Background**

 On 6th November 1849 Mizo Chief Ngura of Sentlang attacked SEIPUIA, (also known as Kooki Raja) Village, which was located at about 9/10 miles south of Silchar. Retaliatory expedition, under Captain Lister was launched against Ngura village Sentlang in Jan 1850. A meeting was arranged on 16-18 December, 1850 between Capt. Lister and Suakpuilala, one of the most influential Mizo Chief. The British proclaim their claim over territory which the Mizos refused to accept. Sa ui tan ( Settlement) ceremony was performed between the British and the Mizos (Lushai) and a boundary line was drawn, which, as described by Col. Elles, Assistant Quarter Master General in his book “Military Report on the Chin-Lushai Country” (pp.27) are as follows:

"The Boundary line extended from a few miles above Lakhipur on the Barak to the northern limits of Hill Tiporrah, passing through the southern extremity of Chuttachurra Range, and the Lushai had been warned that any depredation committed on the British side of this line would be seriously punished."

The Lushais respected this settlement (Sa ui tan) amd there was no border trouble for the next 20 years. The British, on seeing the potential for cultivation of tea in the areas, gradually encroached into Lushai Territory. This was resented by the Lushais who made formal protest to the British in 1865. This fact was recorded by Mr. Mackenzie as follows: Vanpuilala’s (one the Lushai Chiefs) messengers expressed great dread of the advance of the tea gardens up the Sonai, which Capt. Steward endeavoured to allay by showing how advantageous to the Hill tribes the vicinity of a garden would be.” The attitude of Capt. Steward annoyed the Lushais who began to realise the imperialistic design of the British and as a result there was great tension between the British and the Lushais. Owing to the ensuing intense and continual tension in the border the British drew a line of control in 1867. A chain of Military outposts was established along the line at Mynadhar, Monierkhal, Nudigram, Newarband, Jalnachurra and chhuttachura. The line was also known as Ronphari which means "battle or patrol line."In 1870 the British prohibited all their subjects, including the natives, from crossing this newline of control. In 1870-71 Mr. Edgar tried to make a new boundary line which was not accepted by the Lushai chiefs. In 1871, a series of successful concerted raids were launched by the Lushais One British citizen James Winchester was also killed and his daughter Merry Winchester was taken captive by the Lushais. The British took retaliatory measures by sending expeditionary forces into Lushai Hills and had to be contented to limit their actual line of control on the line drawn in 1867. ln 1873 the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation Was made and under the Regulation the Cachar Inner Line was notified in 1875 following more or less the line drawn in 1867 or the Ronphari. The British subjects were not allowed to go beyond this line without written permission of the District Officer of Cachar. This line was established as the boundary between the Lushai Territory and the Cachar District of British India.

A map showing the provincial boundary of the Lushai Hills and Cachar was published by Col. H.R. Thullier, Surveyor General of India in 1893. To this day, the Mizos regard this line as the traditional boundary between the Lushai Hills and Cachar. The Govt. of Assam also recognised this line as the southern boundary of Cachar District, as indicated below –

"The Southern boundary of the Cachar District was defined and gazetted under the Inner Line Regulation in August, 1875, and is now marked by 46 boundary pillars, which are inspected nearly every year and kept in good order. A pass is granted to persons allowed to cross the Inner Line at a fee of 8 Annas for each pass.” (Para 86 of Assam Government Note on the Lushais, 1873 to 1889).

The extension of British occupation upto the line of 1867 or Inner Line of 1875 had driven away many Mizos settlers from their land north of the Inner Line. The Inner Line of 1875 was officially accepted as the southern boundary of Cachar District of British India by the British India Government (Foreign Department) Notification No. 229-P dated 20th August, 1875 read with the appendix to Assam Forest Manual, 1897). A portion of land measuring about 509 Sq. miIes of the Lushai country and beyond the southern boundary of Cachar District of British India was declared as Reserved Forest by the Assam Government in the Assam Gazette Notification No. 5 dated 17. 10. 1878 (Assam Gazette 19. 1O. 1878) Without any consultation or knowledge of the Lushai Chiefs. act of force majeure. It **Therefore, the creation of the Inner Line Reserved Forest under the Indian Forest Act of 1878 by the British Government inside the Lushai Country, and beyond the British boundary was an exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction and invalid in the eye of law.** Moreover, the so Called inner Line Reserved Forest under the Assam Gazette Notification quoted above was admitted to be Mizoram or Lushai Territory in Assam Forest Manual (Vide Appendix to Assam Forest Manual 1897, pp. 57). It may further be mentioned that the southern boundary of Cachar in British India was clearly demarcated and defined and marked with 46 boundary pillars and this line is same as the Inner Line of 1875, excepting this line or boundary there has never been any other boundary demarcation between Mizoram (The Lushai Territory) and Cachar District.

As mentioned earlier several border clashes took place and raids were conducted by Lushai chiefs where even one Englishman was killed and his daughter taken captive. The British also had to send expeditionary forces several times to retaliate and rescue the English girl. Ultimately in equipped and poor Mizo tribals could not stand against the might of the British Empire and their land was forcibly occupied in 1890 and formally annexed in 1895 by the British.

**ANNEXATION OF MZORAM**

Mizoram (then known as the Lushai territory) formally became part of British India on 6. 9. 1895 under Proclamation No. 1698-E, made by the Governor General in Council (Gazette of India 7. 9. 1895) and they made boundary adjustment in 1904 to define the territorial jurisdictions of the two British District Officers of Cachar and Lushai Hills. Since the Lushais had been already subdued, the British Government drew the boundaries to suit their administrative convenience. They also intentionally made arrangement for the settlement of outsiders on the flat lands inside the Lushai Territory, as can be seen below –

“Mr. Fuller thinks it desirable to keep (flat lands ) Within the boundaries of Cachar area which will be colonized by settlers from the district, and not by Lushais.”(Extract from Assam Chief Commissioner’s letter No. 589 Foreign 162P dated Shillong the 14th April 1903). However, this line cannot be identified properly except on map as no actual ground demarcation has been made with erection of boundary pillars. The boundary drawn so arbitrarily without the knowledge of the Mizo people and without any ground demarcation or boundary pillars has been creating problems rather than solving them. **The present so-called boundary line as shown in the Survey of India Map was made in 1904, altered in 1912 and 1930 without consultation and approval of the Mizos.******It is imaginary line pushed farther and farther south of the 1875 Inner Line depriving the Mizos of the gentle slopes and flat lands for the convenience of outside settlers brought by the British.

 **For the people of Mizoram, the only known and established northern boundary is the Inner Line of 1875**, which was drawn before the Imperial British occupied the land of the Mizos and which consided with the declared southern boundary of the Cachar District of Assam. This is also the boundary recognised by and in actual practice both by the people residing in border areas and even by the Assam Government.

There are three points which have been regarded as the boundary points between Cachar and Mizo Hills in practice. These are Kukichera on the Dhaleswari river, Duarband on the old Silchar- Aizawl road and Baga Bazar (Banga Bazar) on the present Silchar-Aizawl road (NH-54). Government servants on transit were regarded to have passed the boundary between Cachar District and Mizo Hills at these points (Vide Assam Fundamental Rule 106 read with Subsidiary Rule, 137). A Mizo Officer who was a Government servant at that time (now retired) clearly mentioned about this).

Therefore, considering all the historical background as well as facts and circumstances of the recent past that are still related amongst the Mizos, it is not possible for the Mizos to accept the imaginary lines, which was drawn without their knowledge or consultation in 1933.

**Current border dispute with Assam**

The three South Assam districts of Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj share border with Mizoram’s Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl districts. Mizoram was part of Assam till 1972, when it became a separate Union Territory. In 1987, it became a full-fledged state.While the two states have sparred over the border in the past, the stand-offs have been relatively non-violent and low-key compared to Assam’s dispute with its other neighbours – Nagaland, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh – on the same matter.

On February 27, the Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP), Mizoram’s most powerful student organisation, built a wooden rest house somewhere in the Inner Line Permit Reserved Forest( 509 Sq Kms), large parts of which run along the Assam-Mizoram border. The spartan structure was meant to serve as a resting place for farmers who worked in the many paddy fields in the area.

Later that evening, however, a joint team of the Assam police and the state’s Forest Department demolished the structure, contending that it was built on Assam’s territory and the construction amounted to encroachment.

But the construction and subsequent demolition of the rest house has led to an escalation of tensions in the area since then, with Mizo activists and journalists accusing the Assam administration of high-handedness and use of excessive force.

On 8.3.2018 members of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) left Aizawl for Zophai near Bairabi, Kolasib District with an intention to reconstruct Zofate Chawlhbuk (Shed) at the disputed site along Mizoram-Assam border. At around 11:45 am, a minor scuffle broke out between the Student union and Assam Police when some members of the student union tried to unload their building materials from the vehicle. The Assam Police had even resorted to Lathi-charge as a result of which around 15 (fifteen) MZP members reportedly sustained minor injuries.

  On****10.3.2018,a scuffle broke out again between Assam Police and members of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) when around 100 (hundred) strong MZP members proceeded to the disputed site at Zophai with their building materials to reconstruct ‘Zofate Chawlhbuk’. The students were intercepted by Assam Police before they reached the disputed site and they subsequently used force to disperse them. It has been reported that the Assam Police initially used Lathi but later on resorted to firing and around 8 (eight) shots were reportedly fired as a result of which one MZP member reportedly sustained gunshot injury on his right ankle and around 49 (forty nine) others sustained injuries on their persons. It was also reported that 8 (eight) media persons also sustained injuries. The Assam Police burnt down the temporary shed constructed by the MZP near the disputed site and the following vehicles belonging to MZP members were also ransacked by Assam Police :-****(1) Sumo - 1 no. (2) Taxi -1 no. (3) Car (Nano) - 1 no. (4) M/Cycles -3 nos.****At least 20 people were reportedly injured on Saturday.

Meanwhile, though the Mizoram state Government has appealed to the Mizo Zirlai Pawl(MZP) to abandon its plans to reconstruct the rest house,but the MZP remains set on it. They also collected donation for recurring damages caused to the properties of MZP by Assam Police as the Government was unable to pay compensation for them. As of now, they have strongly urged the state Government to construct ‘ Zofate Chawlhbuk’ at Zophai failing which they would take every possible steps for the reconstruction.

**BORDER ISSUES WITH MYANMAR**

**Free Movement Regime(FMR) inside Mizoram along Indo-Myanmar Border**

Free Movement Regime (FRM) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that allows free movement of Indian and Myanmarese citizens within 16 km of the border without Visa restrictions for 72 hours. Its purpose is to alleviate insecurity of tribals living along India and Myanmar Border as they still continue to have trans-border linkages with their kiths and kins. This regime has been in place to protect traditional social relations among border people. It helps genuine people living in the close proximity of the border. India and Myanmar share1,643 km unfenced border along four states viz. Arunachal Pradesh (520 km), Nagaland (215km), Manipur (398 km) and Mizoram (510 km) and permit free movement regime upto 16 km beyound border. In January 2018, Union Cabinet had approved agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) between India and Myanmar on land border crossing to enhance economic interaction between people of the two countries.

However, the Ministry of Home affairs said that it is misused by militants and criminals who smuggle weapons, narcotics, contraband goods and Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN). The statement issued by the ministry of home affairs went on to add that with fast improving security situation in this region, militants are denied hideouts here and some of them have relocated themselves across the border. Taking advantage of the free-movement regime occasionally they enter India, commit crimes and escape to their relatively safer hide-outs.

 Mizoram shares 404 kms long border with Myanmar. Five Districts of the State such as Champhai, Serchhip, Lunglei, Lawngtlai and Siaha District share border with Myanmar. Of the five Districts, Champhai shares the longest border with Myanmar. There are 67 villages within FMR. However, the list of villages may not be exhaustive due to lack of devices to measure the aerial distance of 16 Kilometers from the International Boundary. 4 Police Stations Namely, Zokhawthar Op, Thingsai PS, Sangau PS and Lungbun OP fall inside FMR.There has been a proposal to open a new Police Station / Outpost within the Free Movement Regime (FRM) at:

1. Hnahlan, Champhai Dist.
2. Farkawn , Champhai Dist.
3. Zochachhuah, Lawngtlai Dist
4. Saisihchhuah, Lawngtlai District.
5. Tiau, Lunglei District

The State Government has set up 4(four) designated crossing points for the purpose of implementation of the FMR listed below. The major bottleneck faced in the implementation of the FMR is the lesser degree of observance of the FMR on the other side of the border which may perhaps be attributed to ignorance of the provision of the same by the concerned authorities of the neighbouring country.

**Details/number of designated crossing (entry/exit) points for authorized crossing -**

- Zokhawthar - Champhai District
- Thingsai - Lunglei District
- Lungbun - Siaha District
- Phura - Siaha District

**Selective Fencing Of Indo-Myanmar Borders and other issues :******

- The 404 km long Indo-Myanmar border in Mizoram sector is manifested by inhospitable terrain.
- If fencing is to be erected from 150 - 500 yards from the ‘Zero Line’, a large number of villages located close to the border and all fertile plains will be fenced out.
- The State Government does not want to repeat the compensation problems faced and experienced with the Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing.
- The finalisation of Border Pass scheme would supersede the present system which will be more effective for preventing any cross border challenges
- The Indo-Bangladesh Border fencing has in many instances caused havoc to the livelihood of the border populace and the State Government does not want to repeat this again. Hence, **the State Government is not in favour of constructing Indo-Myanmar Border fencing.**The decision/view of the state Government regarding the same has been conveyed numerous times to MHA vide Home Department letter No.F.22015/14/2005-HM-Vol-II dated 11.5.2012, 14.5.2013, 8.8.2013, 2.11.2016 and 8.12.2016.

**Border Pass**

1. A Border Pass is to be a restricted travel document issued by designated authorities of bordering states to Indian Nationals who are local original residents of the area falling within 16 kms. of International Border to enable them to enter the border areas of Myanmar. The Border Pass will have Security features to prevent forgeries. The security features will be reviewed from time to tim. The following authorities will be authorized to issue the Border Pass :

 a) Deputy Commissioner of the District.

 b) Superintendent of Police / FRO

 c) Authorised Officer of Indian Mission or any other officer specifically authorized  by the State Governments of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and  Mizoram.

2.The Border Pass will be valid for a period of one year from the date of issue and its validity may be extended upon renewal, for a subsequent period of one year at a time. It shall be valid for multiple entries with the holder permitted to stay in the border areas of Myanmar for up to two weeks per visit. In case anything adverse comes to the notice of authorities, Border Pass may be cancelled any time by the issuing authority. A citizen of Myanmar holding a Border Pass issued by authorities in Myanmar will be able to enter and stay within 16 kms. of International Border on Indian side. The State Government will ensure that no Border Pass holder from Myanmar goes beyond 16 kms. of International Border. In case of violation by a Border Pass holder, prosecution under relevant Act(s) and law(s) will ne done by the State Government. The issuing authorities in India shall make available to the authorities in Myanmar through diplomatic channels, the names, specimen of those who are authorized to issue the Border Pass and data of all Border passes issued.

 The Border States on International Border will draw up a list of villages falling within the aerial 16 kms. of International Border. This list is to be made available to Border Guarding Forces, State Police and the issuing authorities of Border Pass.

3.**Movement of Vehicles across International Border**

  At present, there is no agreement between India and Myanmar on Motor Vehicles crossing International Border. Therefore concerned State Governments/Border Guarding Forces must ensure that there is no unauthorised crossing of vehicles at International Borders, except with specific approval of competent authorities.

4.**Roles and Responsibilities**

| Sl. No. | Agency | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | State Government/Border Guarding Forces/Bureau of Immigration | Checking Travel Documents/ Border Pass at ICP/Authorized crossing points |
| 2 | State Police | Checking Travel Documents beyond 16 kms. of Indo-Myanmar Border and prosecution of violators. |
| 3 | State Government/Border Guarding Forces/ BOI | Repatriation/Deportation/Handing aver of Foreigners without travel documents to Myanmar Authority. |
| 4 | State Government/State Police | Prosecution under appropriate Act for violations punishable. |


****BORDER ISSUES WITH BANGLADESH****

**Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing ( IBBF )**

1. The Project : Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing Project at the initial total estimated cost of Rs. 656 crore

Objective: To put up physical barrier along 336.62km long Indo-Bangladesh border for internal security of the country.

Scheme: The scheme comprised of four components

_(1)_Fencing

(2) Road

(3) BOP

(4) Floodlighting

**Modalities for execution of work :**

(i) **Fencing/Road:**

The physical topography of the international border with Bangladesh is placed below -

Land boundary  - 44.95 kms.

Riverine boundary - 291.67 kms.

Out of the total 336.62 kms, 180 kms fall within the purview of E&amp;FDepartment, out of which 118 kms falls under the category of reserved forest and the remaining 62 kms falls inside the Dampa Tiger Reserve.

**The following agencies have been entrusted the border works as under–**

**IBB Fencing :**

_NBCC - 110 km_

_NPCC - 150 km_

_EPIL - 83 km_

**Border Roads :**

_NBCC - 155 km_

_NPCC - 141 km_

_EPIL - 53 km_

_BRO - 20 km_

 As per the scheme, fencing is to be erected at a distance of **150 yards** from the International Border but in a situation where, owing to inhospitable terrain / topography, it is not possible to adhere to this stipulation, the guidelines permit that in such cases, the fencing could be erected within as much as **500 yards** inside Mizoram from the **zero (0)** line. However, these guidelines have not been uniformly followed by the Executing Agencies and alignments were made as per convenience. In some locations, entire villages are outside the fencing; in some cases, the fencing cuts through the middle of existing villages creating problems in the entire border areas of Mizoram. The brief are as follows -

Villages cut by IBB fencing -15 villages

Partially damaged by IBB fencing - 18 villages

Villages bifurcated by IBB fencing - 13 villages

Villages totally fenced out - 3 villages

Re-allignment done by Authorities - 6 villages

**(ii).** **Border Outpost (BOP):**

**Composite BOPs :**The following agencies are entrusted with the work of construction of Border Outposts

- _NBCC - 11 km_
- _NPCC - 35 km_
- _EPIL - 39 km_

Border out post is to be constructed after every 3.5 km of the fencing. The total

Border Out-Posts requirement of the State stands at 91 Border Out-Posts.

(iii). **Border Floodlighting:**

The following agencies are entrusted with the work of Border Floodlighting :

NBCC -  61 km

EPIL  - 275 km

Total amount of Project Cost  = Rs. 64 crore

Total amount of fund sanctioned at 1st Installment = Rs. 21 crore

Total amount of fund sanctioned at 2nd Instalment = Rs. 38 crore

Remaining fund yet to be sanctioned = Rs. 05 crore

**2. There are numerous problems in implementing Border fencing which are**

(i)__Inhospitable terrain_._

(ii)__The State Government was not taken into confidence by the concerned Ministry on this project.

(iv)Lack of cooperation from Executing Agencies at the initial stage of the implementation.

(iv) Lack of institutional mechanism for evaluation and monitoring of the project.

****3**. **Initiatives taken by the State Government****
