**Mizoram Government has no intention to fulfill Lailapur ABYSA's demand** : The deadline for the Govt. to fulfill ABYSA's demand which is to allow Cachar people to come to work without ILP at IOC depot in Vairengte was over at last midnight. Mizoram Home Minister told Vanglaini that Mizoram Govt. has no intention to fulfill ABYSA's demand.

Meanwhile, on 29.9.2012 at about 5:00pm, people who are believed to be of ABYSA's came to Mizoram area, but before they reached Police check gate, some women of Vairengte stood together on the road shouting at ABYSA's people who then left Mizoram. Among the people who came to Mizoram were Assam Govt. border and co-operation minister Sindique Ahmed Majumdar and an MLA of Dholai named Girindra Malik. The reason for their visit was not known.

Concerning ABYSA's demand, a meeting was held on the night of 28.9.2012. The meeting was led by Vairengte SDO(C) and SDPO, diffrerent NGO, V/C and political parties also attended the meeting. The meeting decided not to consent the Assam Government's(Cachar Addl. DC) demand of letting 300 casual labours of Lailapur to work without ILP at Vairengte's IOC locality.

Mizoram Govt. permits 300 casual labours of Lailapur to work in Vairengte but with ILP. NGO co-ordination committee also agreed with this. If ABYSA's demand is to fulfill by the Mizoram Govt., co-ordination committee of NGO Vairengte is likely to organise bandh against the decision.

As already pointed out, ABYSA in order to fulfill their demand, blocked NH-24 but temporarily stopped on 27.9.2012@ 7:00pm with a condition that they will wait for Mizoram Govt's action till 30.9.2012. If Mizoram Govt. do not take action in ABYSA's favour, then they will resume blocking NH-54.

Meanwhile, Mizoram Govt. is of the opinion that it is not possible to fulfill ABYSA's demand, and not yet known whether ABYSA is to resume road blocking or not.
