No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/54

Dated: 24th January, 2019.

In continuation of our Special Report No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/48, Dt. 23.01.2019: A meeting with Mizoram Kohhran Hruaitute Committee (MKHC) was convened by Pu Lalchamliana, Hon‘ble Home Minister at his office chamber today, i.e. 24.01.2019 @ 11:00 a.m which was attended by 3 (three) leaders of MKHC. The Hon’ble Home Minister requested MKHC leaders to mediate with NGOCC leaders to convince them not to picket celebratory function of Republic Day, 2019. As an outcome of the meeting, MKHC had scheduled a meeting with NGOCC leaders at CYMA Hall this evening @ 7:00 p.m.

Pu L.H. Shanliana, IPS, IGP (L&amp;O and Intel.) also convened a meeting with leaders of MZP Gen. Hqrs. at his office chamber, PHQ today @ 1:00 p.m which was attended by top Police Officials and 3 (three) MZP leaders headed by B. Vanlaltana, Vice President, MZP Gen. Hqrs. The meeting held an open discussion about the intended boycott and picketing of the coming Republic Day celebration, 2019 by NGOCC and Pu L.H. Shanliana strongly requested the MZP leaders to refrain from going to the extent of picketing the celebratory function of Republic Day, 2019. The meeting concluded with the promise by the MZP leaders to convey the message before the meeting of NGOCC at the earliest.

Meeting between MKHC headed by Rev. R. Lalhmingthanga, Chairman and NGOCC was held tonight @ 7:00 p.m at CYMA Office, which was attended only by CYMA leaders from NGOCC while MUP, MHIP, MZP and MSU abstained from attending the meeting. Since only one organisation from NGOCC, i.e. CYMA headed by their President, Pu Vanlalruata, attended the meeting, the meeting failed to have a positive outcome.
Since the issue still remained unresolved after today’s events, Pu Zoramthanga, Hon’ble Chief Minister, called a meeting between the Government and all Office Bearers of the member organisations of NGOCC tomorrow, i.e. 25.01.2019 @ 10:30 a.m at Secretariat Conference Hall to have a dialogue so that the present impasse could be resolved.
