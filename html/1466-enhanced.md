_HPC(D) :_When a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) way back in 2018, Lalhmingthanga Sanate designated his HPC(D) splinter faction as 'HPC(D) (President's Group)' and did not participated in the said MoS.

However, by February 2020, 11(eleven) of his cadres deserted him and joined HPC(D)- General Headquarters Sinlung Group, who are under the leadership of Lalkhama @ LK Hmar.
