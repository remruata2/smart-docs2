****NOTES ON PREVAILING DRUG SITUATION IN MIZORAM****

**Introduction:**

** Mizoram has a long international boundary with two countries (496.53 kms with Myanmar and 319.79 kms with Bangladesh) and 284 kms of inter-state boundaries with three other north-eastern states – Assam, Tripura and Manipur. Interestingly Mizoram lies at the periphery of the Golden Triangle historically known for its drug manufacturing and trade. Mizoram has porous international border****with Myanmar and Bangladesh, the rough terrain, lack of proper connectivity poses a huge challenge to security forces at the border areas, it hampers their movement and limit their ability to check drug trafficking and to rapidly respond to attempts made by criminals.**

**Prevailing drug situation in Mizoram:**

 There has been an increase in illegal cross-border drug smuggling in recent years and Mizoram has become a favorable transit route for transporting them to other parts of the country. Major drugs trafficked into Mizoram are heroin, methamphetamine, ganja, pseudoephedrine and codeine based cough syrup. The routes of drugs trafficked in Mizoram are as follows:

1. Heroin is smuggled mainly from Myanmar and Assam for local consumption.
2. Methamphetamine (Yaba tablets) are smuggled from Myanmar through Mizoram for transporting to mainland and neighbouring country like Bangladesh.
3. Ganja is smuggled mainly from Manipur and other parts of mainland India for local consumption.
4. There is reverse trafficking of Pseudoephedrine, which are smuggled from mainland India through Mizoram into Myanmar. The smuggled Pseudoephedrine is used for preparation of Methamphetamine and the finished products i.e. Methamphetamine tablets were smuggled back into Mizoram from Myanmar for further distribution in the mainland and Bangladesh. Last seizure of Pseudoephedrine was in July, 2019.
