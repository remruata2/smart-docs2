**Drugs seizures****:**

The modus operandi and ways of concealment of smuggled narcotics used by smugglers is constantly evolving. The past seizures of narcotics in the state revealed that these drugs are often concealed in sealed food packages, vegetables, electrical goods and more commonly inside a car door panel or costumed concealed compartment inside a vehicle.

Further, the emerging trend of using end to end encrypted messaging applications and compartmentalizing activities like logistics, finances or intelligence gathering by different groups or units complicated the interception of modern narcotics syndicates.

During this month till 24.02.2025, most of the drugs seized i.e. 80 % (approx.) are destined to Assam and other outerstate whereas 20 % (approx.) are destined for local consumption which are mostly transported from Myanmar.
