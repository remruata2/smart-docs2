Input received stated that CRPH and CDM supporters are adamant and determined to continue their resistance which had shown a new level including armed resistance for their personel defence. CRPH and CDM had been steadfast in collecting arms and ammunitions as much as possible from the neighbouring countries particularly from the state of Mizoram and Manipur. Besides, they are intending to impart wide scale training on handling of arms and weaponry to its youth supporters. However, the training is yet to commenced due to non availaibility of suitable training ground. To reinforce and strengthen their resistance in a more effective manner against the military regime, Civil Security Defence (CSD), Tahan Civil Defence Force (TCDF) and Kalay Civil Army (KCA) are working together and a larger group Upper Chindwin Peoples Defence Force (UCPDF) was also formed for effective counter measures against the Military regime. </span></span></span></span></p>

However, civil society organisations and NGOs&rsquo;cannot let down these Myanmarese refugees particularly from the Chin/Sagaing Region who shared close ethnicity and cultural affinity with the Mizos. Further, the assistance provided by these NGOs&rsquo; confined solely upon arrival of these asylum seekers within the territory of India. </span></span></span></span></p>
