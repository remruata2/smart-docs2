1. **(a)** There has been no report of large number of refugees belonging to minority communities like Hindu, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians who fled from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan and are staying in Mizoram for many years. As such, there are no refugees demanding Indian Citizenship from Mizoram.**(b)** Does not arise.

1. **Supplementary Notes** : The refugees hosted by Mizoram are mainly from Myanmar who fled the armed conflict between Arakan Army and Myanmar Army along the Southern Mizoram (India) – Myanmar border areas during 2017 – 2018. Apart from 4 (four) ladies who could not be deported due to health problems, a total of 215 refugees were deported to Myanmar territory by Government of Mizoram on 2nd July, 2019.
