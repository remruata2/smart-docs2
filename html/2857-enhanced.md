Dated: 13th December, 2019.

 Earlier today, i.e. 13.12.2019 @ 1:00 a.m there was a blast inside the fencing of Aizawl Centenary Monument near Raj Bhavan, Aizawl. The sound of the blast was heard by the sentry duty of the CRPF posted at the Raj Bhavan. Upon hearing the incident Pu S.B.K. Singh, IPS, DGP (M); Pu L.H. Shanliana, IPS, IGP (L&amp;O); Pu John Neihlaia, IPS (Hqrs. &amp; Intel) and other senior Police Officers besides staff from Aizawl Police Station reached the spot immediately. Experts from Forensic Science Laboratory also meticulously examined the spot and had collected samples and other important evidences for further examinations. Fortunately there was no casualty caused by the blast. A small crater near the monument and some window-panes at the adjacent building, i.e. Civil Aviation Wing office were broken. The exact blasting materials used for the purpose of the blast can be ascertained only after conducting necessary examination. However, it seems to have done using some easily available materials in local.
