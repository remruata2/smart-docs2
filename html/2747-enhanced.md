Sir,

 With reference to the subject and your letter no. mentioned above, discreet and careful enquiry/assessment on threat perception in respect of Pu HC Lalmalsawma Zasai, Dy.CEM, MADC was conducted. As a result of the enquiry, owing to the peaceful political atmosphere of MADC areas, no threat against the said Dy. CEM, MADC was found to exist.
