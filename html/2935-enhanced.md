****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/533

Dated: 11th July, 2019.

 Information has been received that some members of Ex-Hmar Volunteer Association (Ex-HVA) had strongly deplored the recent extension of the interim office of Sinlung Hills Council (SHC) and spread rumours indicative of their readiness to take up arms again.

 The matter had been verified and their disappointment appears to be the fallout of accommodating majority MNF workers in the Interim SHC, rather than the extension of its term, and that some disgruntled members had merely let loose talk without having actual intention or preparation of such extremism. Possibility, however, of HPC or HPC(D) returnees going back to underground life overnight cannot be ruled out as they are apt to cross over to Vangai Hills of Manipur for a slightest incitement as had been experienced in the past.

 Activities and movements of Ex-HVA are being closely monitored.
