Camp Court was conducted in order to avoid untoward incident since the intelligence report revealed that the residents of Zohnuai, Lunglei intended to assemble in front of the District Court, Lunglei on the Court date. On 9.9.2016 @ 10:00 a.m, about 40 (forty) residents of Zohnuai, Lunglei gathered in front of District Court, Lunglei demanding to see the accused.
