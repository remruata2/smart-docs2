1. Removal of Dampa Tiger Wildlife Sanctuary for the resettlement of Brus.

 They further demanded the Government of India to immediately address the following demands :

1. Demanded the Central Government to release free ration and cash dole immediately.
2. Demanded Mizoram Government to stop sending vehicles to the relief Camps until and unless the displaced Brus are able to repatriate after the solution of their demands.

 Information received indicated that NGOs will not accept the ongoing repatriation process unless their demands are implemented by the Government. Their future course of action will be decided later as per situation.
