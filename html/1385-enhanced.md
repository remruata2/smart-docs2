 Information has been received that on 13.3.2020 an altercation occurred between some youths of Lungpuk, Siaha District and Ralie (Myanmar). As per input, there was blockade on border crossing at Mizoram-Myanmar border which connects the two villages due to the spread of COVID-19. The said ban on border crossing was jointly enforced and manned by Forest Guards deployed at the border, Lungpuk Village Council and MTP (Mara Thyutlia Py). On 13.3.2020, around 10 (ten) youths of Lungpuk went to Ralie to partake in a Feast prepared at Ralie. As 1 (one) youth of Ralie was prevented from entering into Mizoram on earlier occasion, some youths of Ralie expressed their disappointment as their counterparts could easily crossed the border and a result an altercation occurred between them. 3 (three) youths of Lungpuk sustained some injuries on their bodies and they went back to Lungpuk seeking help and reinforcement. Youths of Lungpuk again went to Ralie in large numbers due to the said altercation, but as a result of positive intervention of Village Council and MTP, the situation was resolved and no further incident occurred.

These youths created ruckus at the check-gate by disturbing MTP youths who were on duty and pulled down posters banning cross-border movement. They further went to Siasi village and created fuss, but VC leaders managed to persuade them to go back to their village. On hearing the above incident, community leaders of Locheita proceeded to Siasi as emissaries and expressed their regret over the incident. A truce was made between the 2 (two) villages and no further untoward incident occurred.
