Subject: National Intelligence Grid(NATGRID) - regarding

Sir,

 With reference to the subject cited above, I would like to mention that National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID)is the integrated intelligence master database structure forcounter-terrorismpurpose connecting databases of various core security agencies underGovernment of Indiacollecting comprehensive patterns procured from various Central government organizations that can be readily accessed by security agencies round the clock. Further, NATGRID had given access to only few selected Central Agencies and now, they are proposing to extend access to the State Police. It may also be mentioned that Pu John Neihlaia, IPS, IGP (Hqrs) and the undersigned attended a virtual meeting on NATGRID conducted by Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on 22.10.2021.

 As directed, project of NATGRID for Mizoram Police was scrutinized and the following points may be noted for kind perusal:

1. **MoU (Memorandum of understanding) :**

Draft Memorandum had been prepared by National Intelligence Grid, MHA, wherein they stated guidelines and responsibilities to be followed by User Agencies, and the stated Memorandum is to be signed between NATGRID and the User Agency i.e., State Police concerned. However, it is opined that there exist neither burden nor liability for the User Agency, if the Memorandum is signed with NATGRID.

1.  **Pre-requisite**:

There are some components which need to be acquired and maintained by the User Agency i.e., State Police viz.:

1. State needs to have NICNET Connection – **The same could be arranged by NIC on being requested.**
2. State needs to have Static IP on Gateway device on NICNET - **The same could be arranged by NIC on being requested.**
3. State will have to provide Static IP to NATGRID – **It could be provided after assigning static IP by NIC**
4. Gateway Device at State will have to whitelist NATGRID provided ports and block rest communication ports for NATGRID IP like RDP, etc. – **It could be done.**
5. State workstation connecting to NATGRID should have basic security and hardening like Anti malware software, Security Patches etc - **Workstation (one computer set with sufficient working space) needs to be set up at the premises of Nodal officer or Application Nodal Officer and the said anti malware software and others may be purchased from open market.**__
6. State will have to install NATGRID provided VPN – Client – **It will not be an issue.**__
7. State will ensure that the authorized workstation will be used to connect NATGRID and access NATSTAR Connector only. The workstation will not be used for any other purpose i.e. it will be a dedicated workstation for use of NATSTAR Connector. – **In this regard, a separate dedicated room needs to be arranged from the available building or construct a new one.**

1. Nodal Officers :

 Apart from the above mentioned components, User Agencies/State Police needs to nominate and submit the list of Nodal Officer (for MoU purposes/not below the rank of IG), Application Nodal Officer (Not below the rank of ASP) and Master Trainers &amp; Users Team members.

 In connection with the above, It is suggested that IGP (intel) may be nominated as Nodal Officer, NATGRID and SP CID (Crime) as Application Nodal Officer, NATGRID. Master Trainers &amp; User Team may be appointed later on by SP (CID) Crime i.e., Application Nodal Officer, NATGRID.

 Submitted for your kind information and perusal please.

Yours faithfully,
