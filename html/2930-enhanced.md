 L. Ramdinliana Renthlei, President, MZP Gen.

H&amp;TE officials also apprised the MZP of the Appeal submitted by Government of Mizoram challenging recent High Court's ruling, and requested them not to resort to any sort of agitation to oppose inclusion of Chakmas in Category-1.

 The MZP, while appreciating the Government's moving of the Apex Court challenging the High Court's order, seemed determined to oppose inclusion of Chakmas in Category-1. Information received stated however that MZP would decide their course of action during coming week.

 Situation under close watch.
