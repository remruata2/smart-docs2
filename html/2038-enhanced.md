Subject :  Clarification of the Hon’ble Chief Minister’s remarks on the body of  Daily Summary of Information

Reference :  No.CB/PHQ/VM/MISC/16/180 dated 23rd August,2017

Sir,

 With reference to the above mentioned subject, I have the honour to clarify that on 14.8.2017 ( i.e Monday), one responsible officer from CID(SB) Field Staff who had been assigned to collect political activities of MPCC went to Golden Hall of MPCC Bhawan, Aizawl and when he entered the Golden Hall, the Devotional Meeting had already started. The concerned officer was not aware of the fact that Pu K.Lalhmingliana, Executive Member, MPCC had been invited to deliver the devotional speech due to non-availability of Pu K. Ropianga. As the concerned officer did not know them personally, (i.e either Pu K.Ropianga or Pu K. Lalhmingliana), he prepared and submitted the report based on the programme written on the Black board. i.e without confirming the identity of the actual speaker.

 When the mistake/error was brought to the notice of the undersigned, necessary Corrigendum was immediately made on 16.8.2017 Vide DSI dated 16.8.2017 , Item No.A.1(Copy enclosed) and disciplinary action was taken against the erring staff of CID(SB). The undersigned had also submitted a Clarification to the Office of the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Mizoram on 22.8.2017 (Copy enclosed).

 Submitted for favour of kind information and necessary action please.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
