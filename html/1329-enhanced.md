**Conclusion:**

 In light of the above stated voices of various NGOs and Political parties of Mizoram against the direction of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to conduct a Special Summary Revision of Electoral Rolls for Bru/Reang in relief camps in Tripura; it is strongly anticipated that if the Election Commission of India(ECI) go ahead with this arrangement, there is every possibility of breakdown of law and order in the state of Mizoram and smooth conduct of Special Summary Revision of Electoral Roll for Brus in Relief camps in Tripura would definitely be disrupted. It is pertinent to reiterate that CYMA is the main NGO with member of 3,50,000(three lakhs fifty thousand) while the two student bodies MZP &amp; MUP together account for 1,00,000(one lakh) members approximately. In addition, MHIP &amp; MUP account for nearly 2,40,000(two lakh forty thousand) and 58,000(fifty eight thousand) respectively. While the total population of Mizoram is approximately 12,00,000(twelve lakhs) and the said NGOs are having bases across the state of Mizoram.

It may be mentioned here that the NGO Co-ordination Committee of Mizoram under the aegis of CYMA had organized Total bandh(72 hours) before polling date of 2014 Lok Sabha election in Mizoram on 7.4.2014 in protest against the ECI’s decision to allow the Brus/Reangs living in Tripura to cast their votes at six(6) relief camps in Tripura as the NGO claimed that the Brus refused to return to Mizoram despite several repatriations attempts. The Total Band was lifted on 8.4.2014@1:30 PM after the Election Commission of India (ECI) committed that provision would be made during future elections to the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly of the State of Mizoram, for exercise of franchise within the state of Mizoram by Bru(Reang) voters living in Tripura enrolled in voter lists of Mizoram._( Copy of ECI letter enclosed in Annexure-VI)_
