(i) SECURITY SCENERIO IN BARAK VALLEY (ASSAM) AND MIZORAM:

 The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful. Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern regions while the state is surrounded by countries and states which are having various insurgency and terrorism related problems.

 There has been no report of any active insurgency within Mizoram after Government of Mizoram and HPC (D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. However, it is reported that the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate has started resurfacing and planning to reorganise themselves which could, in due course of time, may pose security problems especially in the northern most and north eastern parts of Mizoram, which is along the border of Assam

Input received indicated that the said Lalhmingthanga Sanate and RC Singson @ Ramchanlova of Thenzawl, Mizoram raised a new outfit in the name of “Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA)” on 15.12.2021 at Hmarkhawlian, Assam with the following plan of actions:

1. To launch attack againstAssam Police deployed along Assam-Mizoram border with Arms.
2. Non-mizo residing along the inter-state border should be threatened/intimidated.
3. Sufficient number of arms and ammunitions should be procured from National Socialist Council of Nagaland –NSCN (IM).
4. Donation should be collected from residents of Saiphai, Mizoram and its surrounding areas for procurement of arms and ammunitions.

 It was reported that RC Singson, Commissioner/Commander -in-Chief of MBDA along with a couple of his men served ‘Demand Letter’ using HPD (D) Letter Head to Non-Mizo residents of Chemphai areas on 23/24.12.2021 and Saiphai and its surrounding areas on 25/26.12.2021. In this connection, Mizoram Police arrested (1) Lalhriatzuala, Saiphai and Sunday Lalrinsanga, Saiphai and also seized 1(one) no. of AK-47 Magazine and 3(three) rounds; Mobile Phone - 4 (four) nos. and 3(three) rounds of Miniature (.22Rifle) from their possession on 25.1.2022 while they were trying to collect money from the Non-mizos, residing along the inter-state border.

It may also be mentioned that theboundary issue between Assam and Mizoramhas existed since the formation of Mizoram, first as a union territory in 1972, and then as a full-fledged state in 1987. A series of border violent clashes erupted along the border and recently, residents of Mizoram alleged the Assam government of constructing Bailey Bridge connecting Pu Chalchhunga’s farm land to Pu Lalnuntluanga’s farm land across Saihapui river, Phainuam-Buarchep area, Kolasib District, which is within the disputed area by violating the status quo, and there has been reported frequent patrolling of Assam Police and Forest officials within the disputed area without informing security personnel deployed along the border by Mizoram government. In view of this, border clashes could be erupted at any time, if both the states government deals the matter cautiously and through peaceful means, any alleged activities undertaken within the disputed areas should be immediately halted so as to avert any unwanted incidents along the border.

1. TRANS BORDER CRIME CRIME AND ILLEGAL MOVEMENT THROUGH BORDER INCLUDING PRESENT STATUS OF MYANMARESE REFUGEES IN MIZORAM :

_Border crimes and illegal movements:_ Although checking of vehicles for drugs and other contraband items has been conducted at Zokhawthar Police Check Gate (main entry point from Myanmar into Mizoram, India), smugglers/traffickers find alternate routes into Mizoram, crossing the river Tiau at various points along the 496.531 kms long porous international border with Myanmar.

 The **Free Movement Regime (FMR)** also permits tribal residing along the border to travel upto 16-km across the international boundary without visa restrictions. While the FMR has helped the tribes to continue maintaining their age old ties, it has also become a cause of concern for the security as its provisions are exploited by drug smugglers and traffickers to cross over to India (Mizoram) without any restriction. Another provision in the FMR, which allows tribal people to carry head load has also been misused for smuggling drugs, weapons and other contraband items. These head loads are seldom checked by the security forces.

 Refugees fleeing military regime of Myanmar are often reportedly engaged in the trafficking of drugs and other illicit substances. Monitoring the movements of these refugees who may be a possible drugs trafficker may result in the reduction of the flow of drugs from Myanmar to Mizoram. At the same time, good relations with leaders of these refugees may be maintained so as to spread awareness amongst the refugees and to find out any habitual drugs smugglers from them.

_Refugees:_ Many Myanmar refugees presently took shelter in various districts of Mizoram following military coup in Myanmar. These refugees are accommodated in their relatives’ house and makeshift camps set up by NGOs.

 The district wise details of Myanmar refugees are indicated in the following table (as on 2.5.2022) :

| **Sl.No** | **District** | **Total numbers of Refugees** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Aizawl | 1916 |
| 2. | Lunglei | 1986 |
| 3. | Champhai | 7810 |
| 4. | Lawngtlai | 6162 |
| 5. | Siaha | 9817 |
| 6. | Hnahthial | 1732 |
| 7. | Serchhip | 433 |
| 8. | Kolasib | 149 |
| 9. | Saitual | 53 |
| 10. | Khawzawl | 64 |

| **TOTAL -** |  | **30,594** |
