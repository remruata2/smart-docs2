Dated: 2nd October, 2019.

 During the past few days, there have been rumours of attempt to kidnap Mizo children in 3 (three) different locations, viz. Kolasib, Keitum (Serchhip District) and South Lungpher (Lawngtlai District). Several posts were found in the social media, especially Facebook and Whatsapp regarding such alleged attempt to kidnap minors by non-Mizos. However, information has been received that such alleged attempt to kidnap are unfounded or resulted out of misconstruction or lack concrete evidences.

 On 1.10.2019, Julie Lalhruaimawii (3 yrs), d/o Pu Lalrammawia of Bilkhawthlir was alleged to have been abducted by non-Mizo(s) at Kolasib. However, as per input, the said Julie Lalhruaimawii and her father came to Kolasib to apply for Adhaar Card and while they were inside the store, she went outside without her father’s knowledge. The child was found by Pi Lalhlimpuii (58 Yrs), w/o V.L. Siama (L) outside her house at AG Veng, New Diakkawn, Kolasib. The child asked her to take her back to her father, but could not say the location of her father. Pi Lahlimpuii then contacted local leaders and reported the missing child. Input indicated that it is unlikely that the girl was abducted by some non-Mizos or any other.
 On 1.10.2019, Hmingthanzuala (10 yrs) s/o Rothuama of Keitum was allegedly attempted to be abducted by one non-Mizo at Keitum. However, information has been received that the boy made up the story of his abduction to avoid being scolded by his parents for going home late from Badminton Indoor Hall.

 On 30.9.2019 at around 5:30 p.m, Neihtluangpuia (9 yrs), s/o Zarzovi and Timothy (9 yrs), s/o B. Lalzawmliana, both of Lungpher South were allegedly attempted to be abducted by around 4 (four) non-Mizos who were inside a vehicle (Maruti Van) travelling towards Sangau, but they managed to escape. The incident was reported by the two boys to Pu Hlunmawia, Leader, YLA, Dokulha Section. However, there was no evidence to prove the sighting of the said vehicle other than the statements of the two boys or whether the said non-Mizos actually attempted to abduct them. In this connection, all Police Stations and Outposts were put on high alert but no information received so far.


 Situation is under close watch.
