1. **Pu ROCHHUNGA RALTE (Ex MLA and Vice Chairman, Land Revenue & Survey Board)**

 Pu Rochhunga Ralte is presently holding the post of Adviser at Mizo National Front (MNF) General Headquarters and residing at Electric Veng, Aizawl. Like Pu K.Liantlinga, he was also recently appointed to the post of Vice Chairman, Land Revenue &amp; Survey Board, though the powers and functions, entitlements of their appointed Boards or its members are yet to be notified by the concerned authority.

It is concluded that the threat perceived, either direct or indirect against him during his term as MLA or after, is non-existent, be it from insurgent groups, rival political parties, student organizations, NGO’s or even from personal enmity.

1. **Pu TC Pachhunga (Ex-MLA & Vice chairman, Sports, Youth Affairs & Tourism Board) :**

 Pu TC Pachhunga is an Ex-MLA and present General Secretary of Mizoram National Front (MNF) party. He is a resident of Zotlang, Aizawl and active functionary of Zotlang Presbyterian Church. However, recently he was appointed as the Vice Chairman, Sport, Youth Affairs &amp; Tourism Board under the Government of Mizoram. It is further learnt that the power and functions, besides entitlements of the newly formed Board or its members are not yet notified by the concerned authority though.

 After conducting threat assessment perception by approaching sources, contacts and operatives, it is concluded that the threat perceived either direct or indirect against Pu TC. Pachhunga is minimal be it from insurgent groups, rival political parties, student organisations, NGOs, home grown extremism or even from personal enmity.

1. **Pu C.RAMHLUNA** **(Ex-MLA & Vice Chairman, Industrial Development Board)**

Pu C. Ramhluna, Ex-MLA, the newly appointed Vice Chairman for Industrial Development Board does not have direct or indirect threat from any source at present as well as in the past. He personally felt that urgent provision of PSO might not be necessary since the Industrial Development Board itself do not yet have an office of its own. He further stated that such PSO may be needed by him only after having a permanent office. It is therefore concluded that since there exist no possible enmity/competition for power etc. against him and also by considering his own statement, provision of PSO for Pu C. Ramhluna is not urgently necessary for the time being.

1. **Dr.VANLALTANPUIA (MLA & Chairman,Youth Commission,Mizoram)**

The newly appointed Chairman, Youth Commission, Mizoram – Dr. Vanlaltanpuia, MLA did not have any direct or indirect threat from any source in the past or present. Right now, he is being provided with one PSO who is a permanent resident of Lunglei city. From his statement, Dr. Vanlaltanpuia expressed how he wanted to have an additional PSO since it was, sometimes, inconvenient for his PSO to follow him in his entire programme throughout the State as he (the PSO) is based in Lunglei city. Apart from the mentioned reason, no other particular ground is found as to why he needed an additional PSO. Hence, it is considered that instead of providing an additional PSO, the present PSO of Dr. Vanlaltanpuia may be replace by any other officer who is from Aizawl city.
