****WRITE-UP ON FREE MOVEMENT REGIME (FMR) AND MYANMAR REFUGEES INSIDE MIZORAM****

**Free Movement Regime**_:_

 Free Movement Regime (FRM) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that allows free movement of Indian and Myanmarese citizens within 16 km of the border without Visa restrictions for 72 hours. Its purpose is to alleviate insecurity of tribals living along India and Myanmar Border as they still continue to have trans-border linkages with their kiths and kins. This regime has been in place to protect traditional social relations among border people. It helps genuine people living in the close proximity of the border. India and Myanmar shares 1,629.5 kms. unfenced border along four states viz. Arunachal Pradesh (520 kms), Nagaland (215kms), Manipur (398 kms) and Mizoram (496.531 kms) and permit free movement regime upto 16 km beyound border. In January 2018, Union Cabinet had approved agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) between India and Myanmar on land border crossing to enhance economic interaction between people of the two countries.

However, the Ministry of Home affairs said that it is misused by militants and criminals who smuggle weapons, narcotics, contraband goods and Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN). The statement issued by the ministry of home affairs went on to add that with fast improving security situation in this region, militants are denied hideouts here and some of them have relocated themselves across the border. Taking advantage of the free-movement regime occasionally they enter India, commit crimes and escape to their relatively safer hide-outs.

On 08.02.2024, the Hon’ble Home Minister of India had announced the decision of Ministry of Home Affairs regarding scrapping the Free Movement Regime and construction of border fencing along the Indo-Myanmar Border to ensure internal security of India and to maintain the demographic structure of North Eastern States bordering Myanmar.

On the other hand, the recent Mizoram Assembly unanimously adopted an official resolution opposing the Centre’s decision to scrap the Free Movement Regime(FMR) in the Mizoram sector of the India-Myanmar border and proposed erection of fencing along the same. Moving the official resolution, State Home Minister Pu K.Sapdanga stated that they do not want lifting of the FMR and fencing of Mizoram-Myanmar border and appeal to the Centre not to proceed with it.

 Mizoram shares 496.531 kms long border with Myanmar which is unfenced and porous, Six Districts of the State such as Champhai, Serchhip, Hnahthial, Lawngtlai , Siaha and Saitual District shares border with Myanmar. Of the six Districts, Champhai shares the longest border with Myanmar.

**MYANMAR REFUGEES**_:_

 Mizoram shares 496.531 kms of international border with Myanmar as per the record of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram which is unfenced. Moreover, the Free Movement Regime allows people of the adjoining countries to enter 16 kms. into the neighbouring state. The Indo-Myanmar border security is currently handled by Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

 Military rule which took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 deposed thedemocratically electedNational League for Democracy and the escalating resistance put up against the military regime by Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) resulted in the influxes of considerable number of refugees from Myanmar in general and Chin community in particular seeking asylum and taking shelter in Mizoram. These refugees presently took shelter in various districts of Mizoram and are accommodated in their relative’s

houses and makeshift camps set up by NGOs. In the initial stage, makeshift camps for Myanmar refugees were constructed at Zawlsei, Vaphai, Farkawn and Chawngtui Villages in Champhai District and at Thingsai, Bualpui 'H', New Ngharchhip and Cherhlun Villages by in Hnahthial District by their respective local NGOs.

**Latest influx** -

 The influx of Myanmar refugees in large number is last reported when Resistance Force (Chinland Brotherhood and Arakan Army) conducted military operation in the 2(two) Myanmar Army Camps, 304 Battalion and 140 Battalion camped at Matupi township on 09.06.2024 and 13.06.2024 respectively. Consequent upon the arms conflict, many civilian Myanmar Nationals entered Southern part of Mizoram as well as to Aizawl to seek refuge in Mizoram.

** The district wise details of Myanmar refugees, as per this office records, are highlighted in the following table (**as on 22.08.2024**):**

| Sl.No | District | Total numbers of Refugees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Aizawl | 3391 |
| 2. | Champhai | 13966 |
| 3. | Hnahthial | 891 |
| 4. | Khawzawl | 128 |
| 5. | Kolasib | 131 |
| 6. | Lawngtlai | 5922 |
| 7. | Lunglei | 2330 |
| 8. | Mamit | 470 |
| 9. | Saitual | 195 |
| 10. | Serchhip | 347 |

 Influx of Myanmar refugees in large numbers can have an adverse impact socio-economically not only to their relatives who shelter them but also the state government in general. The increase in the number of thefts and robberies may also be attributed to the large number of unemployed refugees. The possibility of Law and Order due to internal feuds between the permanent resident of Mizoram and the refugees could not be ruled out on issues like issuance of birth certificate or other documents to these refugees.

 Another possible consequence of the escalating situation of Myanmar and the influx of refugees is the increase in the amount of narcotics and illegal arms smuggled across the border. The reasons for these increase may be attributed to the decline in the number of military check gates on the Myanmar side and the refugees themselves acting as a peddlers/dealers of these contrabands to support themselves and their families financially as most of these refugees are unemployed in Mizoram and had quit their job in Myanmar.

 On 18.4.2023, a meeting between leaders of Central Young Mizo Association (CYMA), Mara Thyuli Py (MTP) and Central Young Lai Association (CYLA) was held at YMA sub headquarters, Lunglei. Regarding the refugees in Mizoram, the meeting agreed on the following points :

1) To identified and registered all the refugees from neighbouring countries.

2) These refugees should live in accordance with the will of the native people.

3) If CYMA, MTP and CYLA conducted refugee census, they requested other organisations not to interfere nor to conduct a separate census.

4) Before shifting to other places, the refugees should informed their concerned NGO leaders.

 In connection with these Myanmar refugees, an instruction has also been issued by Ministry of Home Affairs (Foreigners Division) vide letter No.25022/102/2018-F.I dt.29.05.2023 for the capturing of biometric of all illegal migrants in the state of Mizoram and Manipur. The instruction further mentioned that a campaign for capturing of biometric data of the illegal migrants are to be completed by the end of September 2023. However, for the state of Mizoram, the meeting of Councils of Ministers held on 27th September 2023 decided it was not advisable to undertake Biometric and Biographic preparation of Myanmar refugees as Mizoram state was on the eve of General Election to the State Assembly during that time.
