****BORDER ISSUES WITH ASSAM****

Mizoram is having approximately 404 kms. and 318 kms. porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively. It has boundary of 123 kms with Assam, 66 Kms with Tripura and 95 Kms with Manipur. Security Border of Mizoram is entrusted mainly with Mizoram Police with sister agencies namely, Assam Rifles, Border Security Force and Central Reserve Police Force

A map showing the provincial boundary of Mizoram (then Lushai Hills) and Cachar was published by Col. H.R. Thullier, Surveyor General of India in 1893. To this day, the Mizos regard this line as the traditional boundary between the Lushai Hills and Cachar. The Govt. of Assam also recognised this line as the southern boundary of Cachar District as indicated below :

 "The Southern boundary of the Cachar District was defined and gazetted under the Inner Line Regulation in August, 1875, and is now marked by 46 boundary pillars, which are inspected nearly every year and kept in good order." (Para 86 of Assam Government Note on the Lushais, 1873 to 1889).

A portion of land measuring about 509 Sq. miIes of the Lushai country and beyond the southern boundary of Cachar District of British India was declared as Reserved Forest by the Assam Government. This so called inner Line Reserved Forest was admitted to be Mizoram or Lushai Territory in Assam Forest Manual.

 After Mizoram (then known as the Lushai territory) formally became part of British India on 6.9.1895 they (the British) made boundary adjustment in 1904 to define the territorial jurisdictions of Cachar and Lushai Hills.

 However, this line cannot be identified properly except on map as no actual ground demarcation has been made with erection of boundary pillars. The boundary drawn so arbitrarily without the knowledge of the Mizo people and without any ground demarcation or boundary pillars has been creating problems rather than solving them.

 **For the people of Mizoram, the only known and established northern boundary is the Inner Line of 1875**, this is also the boundary recognised by and in actual practice both by the people residing in border areas and even by the Assam Government.

Considering the historical background, it is not possible for the Mizos to accept the imaginary lines, which was drawn without their knowledge or consultation in 1933.

**Current border dispute with Assam**

On February 27, the Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP), Mizoram’s most powerful student organisation, built a wooden rest house somewhere in the Inner Line Permit Reserved Forest( 509 Sq Kms), which a joint team of the Assam police and the state’s Forest Department demolished again, contending that it was built on Assam’s territory and that the construction amounted to encroachment.

But the construction and subsequent demolition of the rest house has led to an escalation of tensions in the area since then, with Mizo activists and journalists accusing the Assam administration of high-handedness and use of excessive force.

On 8.3.2018 members of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) left Aizawl for Zophai near Bairabi, Kolasib District with an intention to reconstruct Zofate Chawlhbuk (Shed) at the disputed site along Mizoram-Assam border. This resulted in a minor scuffle between the Student Organization and Assam Police when some members of the student Organization tried to unload their building materials from the vehicle. The Assam Police resorted to Lathi-charge as a result of which around 15 (fifteen) MZP members reportedly sustained minor injuries.

 

 On****10.3.2018,a scuffle broke out again between Assam Police and members of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) at the same spot when Mizo Students Leaders, with their building materials to reconstruct ‘Zofate Chawlhbuk’ were intercepted by Assam Police and the later used force (lathi charge and even firing) to disperse them. Several students leaders and even 8 (eight) Media persons sustained injuries as a result of this scuffle. The Assam Police burnt down the temporary shed constructed by the MZP near the disputed site and the several vehicles belonging to MZP members were also ransacked by Assam Police.

Meanwhile, though the Mizoram state Government has appealed to the Mizo Zirlai Pawl(MZP) to abandon its plans to reconstruct the rest house, the MZP remains set on it. They also collected donation for recurring damages caused to the properties of MZP by Assam Police as the Government was unable to pay compensation for them. As of now, they have strongly urged the state Government to construct ‘Zofate Chawlhbuk’ at Zophai failing which they would take every possible step for the reconstruction.
