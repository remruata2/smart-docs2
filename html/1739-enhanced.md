**1. INTERNATIONAL BORDERS-CROSS BORDERS ISSUES–OUR SECURITY CONCERNS:**

(i) Mizoram is having approximately 512 kms and 323 kms porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively. There are 3 (three) Battalions of Assam Rifles deployed at the Indo-Myanmar border and 3(three) Battalions of BSF deployed along Indo-Bangladesh border. In addition, the state government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn) along the border supplementing the central government forces. _A copy of Mizoram Police and CPMF deployment in Mizoram (with Maps) is enclosed at Annexure-A._

(ii) The porous border areas have widely encouraged other criminal activities like abduction/kidnapping of Indian citizens by Bru militants and Bangladesh/Tripura based insurgent groups like National Liberation Force of Tripura (NLFT). _A Statement of Activities of Bru militants and NLFT is enclosed at Annexure-B_

(iii) The porous border area also open for influx of foreign nationals from Bangladesh i.e Chakmas/Bengali Muslim and Myanmarese from Myanmar into the state of Mizoram. _A Copy of Brief Chakma-Mizo Ethnic issue-2014 is enclosed at Annexure-C_

 (iv) Mizoram being located in a strategic point with foreign countries with porous international borders which served as an important routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle across the border._A copy of the statement of seizure of local made and sophisticated arms for the last five years is enclosed at Annexure-D with map of Armed Trafficking Route._

(v) The recent increase in the smuggling of contraband drugs like Pseudoephedrine, Methamphetamine across the border has called for immediate and proper attention and Mizoram Police has made constant efforts to effect several recoveries. _Statement showing year wise drugs detection by Mizoram Police for the last 5 (five) years upto October, 2014 is enclosed herewith at Annexure-E with map of Drug trafficking Route for reference._

 (v)It is imperative, therefore, that fencing of all the border areas with Bangladesh and Myanmar needs to be expedited on an urgent basis to prevent illegal infiltration and cross border criminal activities.

**2. INTERSTATE COORDINATION:**__

**(i)Border issues with Assam:**

The Assam-Mizoram border has remained relatively calm despite the disputed nature of the border. However, tension along this border flared up in the month of April, 2014 at the inter-state border between Assam’s Hailakandi district and Mizoram’s Kolasib district after Assam Police and Forest Department personnel allegedly dismantled the farmhouse of Mizo farmers near Buhchangphai village in Mizoram. A meeting has been held in Shillong on 24th September 2014 between Mizoram and Assam Officials to resolve this burning issue. On June, 2014 Shri Lal Thanhawla, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Mizoram met Shri Rajnath Singh, Hon’ble Union Home minister and requested him to ensure settlement of the Mizoram-Assam boundary dispute.

**(ii)**Repatriation of Bru Refugees from Tripura state to Mizoram:****

The Bru people who fled Mizoram due to communal tension in 1997-1998 were given shelter in 6 refugee camps at the following places in North Tripura and were given free rations and others essential commodities at the rate fixed by the central government.

Name of Refugee Camps

(i) Naisingpara (ii)Asapara

(iii)Khakchangpara (iv)Hazacherra

(v)Kaiskau (vi)Hamsapara

The Demand of the Bru refugees themselves is that all of them be rehabilitated in Mamit District; the state government considers this impractical. The main consideration of the State government was that they would be rehabilitated in the same Assembly constituency where they were registered as voters. The other demand of the Bru refugees is cash assistance of Rs.1.5 lakhs per family and free ration for two year. The State government of Mizoram has constituted State and District Core Committee for implementation of repatriation and rehabilitation of Bru migrants from Tripura to Mizoram.

 Despite sincere and dedicated efforts, however, the reluctance of Bru refugees especially the so-called Mizoram Bru Displaced People's Forum (MBDPF) leaders and uprising of numerous armed groups among the Bru youths has prevented and even derailed the Bru repatriation processes from time to time and as a result of which only 1261 families ( 6649 members) of Bru refugees have so far been repatriated and resettled in Mizoram State as on 23.6.2014. _A Detail Statement of Repatriation of Bru Migrants from Tripura to Mizoram during 1st Phase to 6th Phase (including self repatriation) is enclosed in Annexure-F_

**3.TALK WITH INSURGENT LEADERS:**

(i)The Hmar Peoples Convention (Democratic) comprising pre-dominantly the Hmar community living in the North Eastern part of Mizoram and Churachandpur District of Manipur has been demanding Autonomous District Council for Hmar community since 20 (twenty) years back and took up arms to wage war against the State of Mizoram and indulged in various criminal activities within Mizoram. _A Statement of Criminal Activities of HPC-D is enclosed in Annexure-G_

(ii)The Government of Mizoram and HPC –D (H.Zosangbera faction) held the first round of Peace talk on 11th November,2010 and subsequently on 31st January 2013, 18th July 2013 and 14th August 2013. However, the last round of talk held in Aizawl on 14th August 2013 ended in a deadlock as both the parties could not agree on the conditions and duration for further extension of Suspension of Operation (SoO).

(iii) Government of Mizoram has asked the Union Home Ministry to declare Manipur-based H.Zosangbera faction of Hmar People's Convention-Democrats as unlawful organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.

(iii) Meanwhile, leaders of another faction of HPC (D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate suggested their keenness for revival of the peace talks. On 20.10.2014, a meeting was held in the office Chamber of Home Minister under the chairmanship of Pu.R.Lalzirliana, Hon’ble Home Minister and the meeting entrusted CID (SB) with the preliminary task of holding the parley with the said leaders of HPC-D.

**5.****PROPOSAL FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF SECURITY RELATED EXPENDITURE (SRE)**

1. The Central Government is implementing a Non-Plan scheme for reimbursement of Security Related Expenditure (SRE) for the States affected by militancy/insurgency. The scheme is being implemented in all States of the region except Mizoram and Sikkim.

2. Mizoram is not a part of this scheme but the peace in Mizoram is never to be taken for granted as there are potential threats from within and outside the state. Its ethnically mixed population has proven itself to be a potential threat to law and order of the state. There have been recent instances of sections of the ethnic minorities with perceived sense of neglect and alienation resorting to disruptive activities in Mizoram. Activities of the HPC’D’ and Bru militants have often resulted in law and order problems in the north-eastern fringes (Manipur border) of the state and in Mamit District in the west, respectively. _A map of affected areas of UGs in Mizoram is enclosed as Annexure-I_. The nos. of insurgency related incidents and insurgents / militants arrested by Mizoram Police during the last 7 (seven) years are as under:

| **Sl. No** | **Year** | **No. of Arms seized** |  **Rounds of Ammunition Seized** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | 2007 | 45 | 90 |
| 2. | 2008 | 57 | 9601 |
| 3. | 2009 | 65 | 3816 |
| 4. | 2010 | 54 | 910 |
| 5. | 2011 | 19 | 95 |
| 6. | 2012 | 19 | 166 |
| 7. | 2013 | 86 | 1897 |
| **TOTAL** |  | **345** | **16575** |


3. Due to these incidence, the Mizoram Police including Indian Reserve Battalions are spending lot of amount in resiting insurgency and terrorist related activities. It is understood that under SRE, the expenditure incurred on various items, including raising of India Reserve Battalions, 75% of the expenditure incurred on POL (petrol, oil and lubricants) in operations and honorarium paid are being reimbursed.

4. It is therefore, proposed to reimburse clearance of TA / DA bills of Rs. 630.00 lakhs and maintenance of vahicles purchased under MPF scheme for Rs.500.00 lakhs per year.

**Maintenance of vehicles purchased under MPF Scheme**

1. Mizoram State is having militant groups operating from inside as well as from outside the state namely Bru National Army and HPC (D) who resorted to kidnapping, bomb blastings for the purpose of terrorisation and there are a lot of militant activities in North East and North West corner of Mizoram. But Mizoram is not included under SRE scheme for which no re-imbursement is coming forward from Central Government for expenditure incurred on operation against these militant. Besides, arms smuggling and drug smuggling which engaged our attention so much so that police are spread over the whole international and national borders incurring huge expenditure on their movements. Many vehicles had been purchased under MPF Scheme.

1. These vehicles are fruitfully utilized for operation duty on the northern and western part of Mizoram where militant and smuggler infested the area and also for law and order duty. Many vehicles are presently unroad worthy and off –roaded as the State Govt. is not in a position to provide the require maintenance fund. As a result, repair bill of vehicles are kept pending. Further repair is also not feasible as the workshop owners refused to repair our vehicles without clearing the pending bills. If we can clear our pending bills our vehicle could only be made roadworthy. In order to keep up mobility and smooth functioning of Mizoram Police, it is required to clear huge pending repair bill of vehicles amounting to Rs 295.00 lakhs so that off – roaded vehicles can be placed in good running condition again.

**Proposal for clearance of TA/DA bills**

7.  Mizoram Police manned as many as 38 Police Stations, 13 Out Posts and 23 Battalion Out Posts conducting sustain operation against the disruptive activities as stated earlier which requires a huge amount for payment of TA / DA. Pending liabilities of TA / DA of Police personnel amounting to Rs **630.00 lakhs** may be considered for allocating in the Police Housing (Plan).

**8. As of now, the State is yet to avail of assistance under the **Security Related Expenditure** **(SRE)**, Ministry of Home, GOI as has been provided for North East states. Considering the State’s precarious resource position and the limited budget of the Home Department, proposal for assistance for an amount of Rs. 11.30 crores is proposed for provision during 2014-15.**

9.  Maintenance of peace and security of the state, the region, and the country as a whole is the mandate of Mizoram. It is crucial for the internal security of the North-East as well as the country. The State occupies a strategically important geographical location in terms of security issues emanating from adjoining international borders, economy issue as a result of the proposed look East Policy where the State will be an important corridor for international trade etc. Due to these same reasons, the resources and capacities of the state police have been stretched in as much as that there are pending liabilities related to security related expenditures.

****SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF SECURITY RELATED EXPENDITURE (SRE)****

(i) Reimburse clearance of TA / DA bills of Rs. 630.00 lakhs

 (ii) Maintenance of vehicles purchased under MPF scheme for Rs. 500 lakhs
