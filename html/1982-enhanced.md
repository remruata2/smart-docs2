**Brief History:**

 My particulars are stated as above. I was born in the year 1978 at Thaidor village, Mizoram. I have three brothers and two sisters. I studied up to Class 'V' from Thaidor village and when I became 18 years old our family migrated/shifted to Naisingpara,Tripura. We have been staying at Naisingpara,Tripura till today. I joined BNLF(Bru National Liberation Front ) in the year 2006 and received training near Naisingpara Camp just prior to surrendering of BNLF militants before Governmnet of Mizoram. After I surrendred before Governmnet of Mizoram, I joined again NLFT with Duhawma at Bangladesh in the year 2011 and we spent most of our times in different part of Bangladesh. I performed jhum works and others manual (coolie) works. I also involved in the demand of ransom money to the family of victims of the recent Kidnapping incident within Mizoram like Kidnapping of five Forest staff (MR) on 18.02.2013 and kidnapping of three workers of Gautam Construction on 5.6.2013 and on abduction of Deep Mandal and two Mizos 23.11.2013. I had telephonically contacted the victims families and made demand for ransom money.

I came out from Bangladesh on December-2013 due to some misunderstanding I had with some of my colleages (particularly with Sektaraipa, Home in-charge) on collection of donation money within our Demand area. I stayed in Naisingpara Refugee Camp.

I met Zorama @ Noiboram during the early part of this year i.e 2014 and we discussed about working with HPC-D and way to solve my criminal cases. In pursuance of his assurance, I came to Silchar with three of my colleages and on 12.7.2014 we were apprehended by Mizoram Police CID (SB) Team at Bani Hotel, Silchar.
