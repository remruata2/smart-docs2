In the past, the contractors involved in the Kaladan Multi Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) within the operational area of Arakan Army had reportedly faced monetary demand from the Arakan Army. However, the latest inputs suggested that Arakan Army has no intention of disrupting the KMMTTP within their operational area. On the contrary, the spokesperson of Arakan Army/United League of Arakan (ULA) had recently stated that Arakan Army will not interfere on the ongoing project of KMMTTP and expected a good relation with the Indian Government. It is further reported that the flag of Arakan Army had been hoisted at Paletwa Township to mark their dominance of the area. No reports of Myanmar civilians entering India/Mizoram due to the recent arm conflict have been received.

 Further information received indicated that the Khumi National Defence Army (KNDA) did not appreciate the hoisting of Arakan Army flag at Paletwa Township. The Khumis had been claiming the areas of Paletwa Township as their ancestral home and latest inputs suggested that the Khumis from different part of the country are being recruited to join the Khumi National Defence Army (KNDA) to overthrow the Arakan Army from Paletwa Township. The arm conflict between the Arakan Army and the Khumi National Defence Force (KNDA) if occurred could resulted in influx of Myanmar Nationals into Mizoram, India.

****REPORT ON THE STATEMENT MADE BY ARAKAN ARMY (AA) SPOKEPERSON****

 The Arakan Army (AA), an armed ethnic group fighting Myanmar’s military junta, has surprisingly expressed support for the Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) in a recent interview. This project, spearheaded by India, aims to connect the two nations through a waterway and road link, offering significant economic benefits.

 Despite ongoing conflict with the Myanmar military, the AA spokesperson, representing the United League of Arakan (ULA), stated that the project would be “totally safe” after they “re-capture Kaladan and Laymro river deltas.” This signals a potential shift in stance, given prior concerns about the project’s impact on local communities and potential exploitation by the junta.

 The spokesperson further emphasized their openness to cooperation with India, stating, “We have no problem with India and are ready to cooperate for mutual benefit.” This could pave the way for future dialogue and collaboration once the political landscape in Myanmar stabilizes.

 However, challenges remain. The KMMTTP has faced delays due to the volatile political situation and complex logistics, including the construction of a critical 109 km road segment within Myanmar. The initial completion date of 2014, followed by the revised December 2023 deadline, have already been missed.

 Despite these hurdles, the AA’s newfound support, coupled with India’s ongoing commitment, highlights the potential of the KMMTTP to foster regional development and trade. Finding common ground amongst stakeholders, including the AA and the future Myanmar government, will be crucial in realizing this crucial project’s full potential.
