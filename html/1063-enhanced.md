To

 The Assistant Inspector General of Police (Hqrs)

 Police Headquarters

 Mizoram, Aizawl

Subject: Withdrawal of Armed Security Guard from Lunglei Judicial Quarters regarding.

Sir,

 In compliance to Commandant 2nd MAP, Lunglei, Mizoram letter no. 2BN/R-39/2020/101 Dated Lunglei, the 22nd April, 2020 and subject mentioned above, I am to state that threat perception assessment in respect of Judicial Quarters, Lunglei was thoroughly conducted and findings are as below :

 It is concluded that no direct threat in regard to Chief Judicial Magistrate as well as Judicial Quarters, Lunglei was perceived from local organisations either from NGOs or student bodies at the moment. However, some people used to meet the magistrate at his quarters regarding their cases, due to this reason, isolated and unorganised incident wherein wayward youths having no affiliation to any particular organisation resorting to some violent action towards Judicial Quarters, Lunglei as a way to vent their anger against their Court's Judgement could not be ruled out at the moment.

 Submitted for kind information and further necessary action please.

Yours faithfully
