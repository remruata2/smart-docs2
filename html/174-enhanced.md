Subject: Assessment of threat perception

Ref: MSB/CB/B-19(A)/07/406 Dt. 13.5.2015

Sir,

 In pursuance of your order, security threat assessment was conducted on Pu JH Rothuama, MLA &amp; Chairman of NLUP Implementing Board. As Government of Mizoram accepts his designation as equivalent of Cabinet Minister and as he is an Ex-Minister, he is still being provided with House Guard and 3 (three) PSOs whereas he himself said that he has not received any threat directly or indirectly from any corner.

 As such is the condition it is considered that House Guard is no longer needed and may be withdrawn. PSOs should still be provided for his designation is of a Cabinet Minister rank. And it is suggested that, Security Guard should be provided as and when situation demands.

Yours faithfully,

SI ( P.VANLALRUATA )
