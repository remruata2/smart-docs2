****RECRUITMENT OF 20 (TWENTY) STAFF NURSES****

 On 25.8.2014, a two days written examination for recruitment of 20 nurses under the Government started at Pachhunga University College, Aizawl and Govt. Central Higher Secondary School, College Veng, Aizawl. The conduct of examination was opposed by three groups under the Mizoram Contract Nurses Association(MNCA) who are mainly private nurses, contract nursed and B.Sc (Nursing). Around 500 members gathered in front of the PUC gates trying to persuade other members not to appear for the examination.

 After a minor altercation with the Police, Examination was peacefully conducted for those willing to appear for the examination without any major incident. Those who are opposing the examination sat outside the main gate of Pachhunga University College but did not create any trouble. The numbers of candidates sitting for the written examination were as under:

 1. Pachhunga University College : 164

 2. Govt. Central Higher Secondary School : 104

 TOTAL : 268

 Report is received that the protestors are intending to launch a stronger action by obstructing the appearing candidates from reaching the examination centre outside the main gate. To prevent any untoward incidents necessary security has been arranged.

 On 26.8.2014, written examination for recruitment of staff nurse under the Government continued at Pachhunga University College. The protesting nurses intensified their protest by trying to block candidates on their way to the examination centre. After a brief altercation with the Police on duty, willing candidates were escorted to the examination centre and the examination continued peacefully with 210 candidates sitting for the day’s examination.

 During the clearing of path for the candidates, one of the protestors named PC. Lalthanmawii(35) D/o PC. Khawkunga, Ngentiang reportedly suffered a minor fracture of the left thumb.

 The protestors then held a press conference at Aizawl Press Club @ 1500 hrs. in which they demanded recruitment of staff nurse through interview only. They also condemned their fellow Nurses for appearing against the decision of their organization to boycott the examination. They also expressed their grief in the deployment of Police force against their demonstration.

 After the press conference, some of the members numbering around 30 headed towards the Chief Minister’s Office where their leaders reportedly met Pu Lal Thanzara, Health Minister. They also submitted an application for interview with the Chief Minister on his return from his tour.
