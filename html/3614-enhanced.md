****Around Rs. 160 lakhs received from pineapples**: Last week, on 1st October, 2022, pineapple growers of Sialhawk town completed harvesting of their pineapples for this year which amounted to around 12,100 quintals in all. These harvested pineapples were sold off to not only different parts of the Mizoram and other states, but also abroad. These pineapples were sold at the rate of Rs. 10 per kilogram to an agent who again distributed them to the market. There are 240 families in Sialhawk town who are engaged in the cultivation of pineapple and the largest producer harvested 370 quintals of pineapples this season. They organised themselves by forming an organisation - Sialhawk Pineapple Grower Society (SPGS). As per the reports of SPGS leaders, during the initial phase of the harvesting season, these growers face difficulties due to the financial problem in the state. However, thanks to the efforts of Dy. Chief Minister, Pu Tawnluia, they managed to sell off the bulk of their products to MIFCO which was a great relieve for them.**
