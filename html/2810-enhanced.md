**1. Radicaliasation/Terrorist activities of HuT**

 Since, there has been no report of any active militant groups operating within the state, militant groups operating in the bordering states and countries are closely supervised to the possible extend.

**2. Dealing with migration of refugees from neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh:**

**Indo-Myanmar Border Issue:**

 According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of unfenced International border with Myanmar, which are scattered around 30 - 40 small villages in Mizoram side. International border posts along the Indo-Myanmar border are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy and Free Movement Regime (FMR) will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Due to its long porous international border with Myanmar, influx of foreigners and large scale smuggling of drugs and various contrabands into the state through the porous borders has remained a serious concern for several decades.

 The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar allow Myanmar’s national to enter up to 16 kms into Mizoram Territory without any VISA restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the Indo-Myanmar.

 As per the office record of CID (SB), as many as 28,602 (twenty eight thousand six hundred and two) Myanmar refugees are presently taking shelter within the state as on 17.10.2022 following Military coup in Myanmar since 1.2.2021 and they are presently staying at Temporary/Makeshift Camps set up by NGOs at various locations across the state. Some refugees are also staying at their relatives’ houses and some are staying in rented houses.

It has been reported that various instances of seizure of drugs smuggling and other contraband items from the illegal possession of Myanmar refugees occurred in recent days. Myanmar refugees may also be involved in other crimes such as theft, physical assault owing to their poor financial condition. The following measures may be taken to curb security threat of Migration from neighboring Myanmar. 

1. _Strengthening of Security and Intelligence Network along Mizoram-Myanmar Border_:

In addition to deployment of Assam Rifles at the international border, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) at various Border Outposts (BOPs) along the border to supplement the Central Armed Forces.

Apart from strengthening deployment of Assam Rifles along the border, it is also necessary to set-up new Police Stations/BOPs (with the financial assistance of Central government) along the border areas to act as a second layer behind the Assam Rifles keeping effective watch on the infiltration of Rohingyas migrants/foreigners and other cross border criminal activities.

1. _Detection and proper registration of along Mizoram-Myanmar Border_

In order to detect illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram, 3(three) Special Task Force (STF) had already been set up in three districts of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.

__Similarly, Special Task Force (especially for Myanmar refugees) may also be set up at the district level to identify and maintain proper registration of refugees from Myanmar staying inside the territory of Mizoram in the wake of Military Coup_._

1. Maintaining close cooperation with the people:__

Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be of great assets for the government and the border guards alike.

1. _Maintaining close coordination with counterpart Security Forces_:

The two border guarding forces viz. Assam Rifles, who are guarding the Indo-Myanmar border and Border Security Force (BSF), who are guarding Indo-Bangla border should try to have close coordination with Myanmar Army and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) through routine meeting, joint patrolling along the border etc.

1. _Constitution of Border Crime and Security Committee_:

The Border Crime and Security Committee under the chairmanship of concern District Superintendent of Police and head of border guarding force and other concern departments’ viz. Custom &amp; Excise, Land &amp; Revenue etc .as its members should be constituted. The committee should review the security and crime situation of the international border within the district and meeting should be held regularly, any suggestions/proposal relating to border security/crime should be submitted to Police Headquarters for further submission to the state Home Department for necessary action.

1. _To adopt multi-pronged approach of Border Security_:

In order to seal the Indo-Myanmar and Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government should adopt multi-pronged approach which includes construction of border fencing, floodlighting, setting up of more Border Out Posts (BOPs) along the border, induction of latest surveillance equipments like Hand Held Thermal Imagers (HHTI), Night vision Goggle/Devices, etc.

1. _Setting up of Police Station/Outpost in the bordering villages_:

Presence of Police Stations/Out Posts in border villages deter trans-border criminals, infiltrators, illegal immigrants and hostile elements from indulging in the activities of intrusion/encroachment and border law violations. In order to effectively manage and prevent cross border crime and law &amp; order situation in the bordering villages, the state government should set-up more civil police stations/outposts in bordering villages, located at a strategic location. The Police Stations/Outposts could also act as second layer behind the BSF/Border Out Posts (BOPs)/Assam Rifles to keep effective watch on happenings in border villages.

1. _Setting Up of Immigration Check Post_ :

  Special attention should be given to districts having international border viz. Mamit District, Champhai District, Lunglei District, Hnahthial, Saitual, Serchhip, Lawngtlai District and Siaha District. The State is conduit for illegal migration due to its long porous international border and ethnicity linked with the bordering countries. The Chakmas/Brus community dominated areas in the southern and western part of the state should be given more focus in respect of illegal infiltration due to its reported abnormal growth rate.

 Recently, Home Department, Govt. of Mizoram issued Order for creation of post for Immigration Check Post at Zokhawthar, Champhai District; Kawrpuichhuah, Lunglei District and Zorinpui, Lawngtlai District. However, filling up of the said post has not been made till date and the same should be expedited for proper functioning of the stated Immigration Check Post.

**Indo-Bangladesh Border Issue:**

The 319.791 Kms long porous international border between Mizoram (India) and Bangladesh could be a security threat and migration routes for illegal immigrants into Mizoram. **As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division, further infiltration of illegal migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.**

****It is necessary to explore the possibilities to tackle and check on growing influx of illegal migrants from neighboring Bangladesh.

1. _Setting up of Border Management Division_:

Many states in the country are having a separate Border Management Division and considering the strategic location of the state, it is imperative to set up a separate Border Management Division in the State. The state has border with militant infested Countries viz. Bangladesh and Myanmar, and States viz. Manipur, Tripura and Assam and there have been many instances of seizure of Arms, smuggle items viz. Arms, Drugs etc. and report has been received on many occasions regarding use of the state as transit by various militant groups and there have been alleged reported infiltration of illegal Bangladeshi in southern districts of the state. A separate Border Management Division under Home Department/ Police Headquarters should be set up, which will specialize in managing the border.

1. _Cross Border Delivery by Pregnant Women_:__

 There have been reported instances in the southern districts of Mizoram that many pregnant women from Bangladesh enter the state on the pretext of seeking medical assistance and giving birth due to poor medical facilities in their area. As the new born baby has to be registered by the Hospital, they can easily get citizenship status of the country by birth. The matter has to be dealt carefully as it can be security threat for facilitating illegal infiltration and compromise Citizenship status in the Country.

1. _Strengthening of Task Force specially constituted to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram &deportation:_

 In order to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram and for their deportation, 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District. These Special Task Forces should be reinforced by making separate budgetary provision, routine meeting etc. for their effective functioning.

****4. _Expedite Border Fencing work:_

The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was 344.41 Km. The border fencing work should be expedited in order to prevent illegal infiltration.

**3. Improving operational and intelligence coordination amongst NE States with specific reference to MAC/JTFI :**

****

There has been close cooperation between Mizoram and other neighbouring NE states. In one instance, Parimal Debbarma, @ Phankrak s/o Umesh Debbarma (L) Khengrabari, Khowai District, West Tripura who is the Commandar-in-chief of NLFT (Parimal Debbarma faction) was arrested by CID(SB) personnel of Mizoram and handed over to Tripura Police on 14.03.2021. In another incident, a joint operations team of CID(SB),Mizoram and Assam Rifles was formed for apprehension of National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT), Leader/President, namely Jacob Hrangkhawl and was apprehended on dt.06.07.2022 at Aizawl. He was handed over to Tripura police on 07.07.2022. It may also be mentioned that Mizoram Police regularly attended SMAC Meeting conducted by SIB.

**4. Meeting security imperatives for implementing Act East Policy :**

Look East Policy of India was launched by the former Prime Minister P.V Narasimha Rao in 1991. The main focus of this policy was to shift the country’s trading focus from the west and neighbors to the booming South East Asian countries. This policy continues till the formation NDA government in 2014. Since the formation of the new government in the centre, the government transformed it to “Act East Policy” and it was launched at the East Asia Summit in Myanmar in November, 2014. It is a diplomatic initiative to promote economic, strategic and cultural relations with the vast Asia-Pacific region at different levels.

**Act East Policy and Mizoram**:

Mizoram shared 496.531 kms. boundary with Myanmar and could be the gateway to the South East Asian countries once the projects under Act East Policy are completed due to its strategic location. Despite having occupied a strategic place in the AEP for it ‘high standards’ of human development indices such as literacy rate and sex ratio, infrastructural deficit however it still remains acute. Mizoram is predominantly an agrarian state like most of the other states of Northeast with more than 70 percent of its population engaged in agriculture, however, improvement in agricultural productivity has remained marginal. The industrial sector has not grown as a result of lack of infrastructure and scarce availability of raw material. The contribution of the tourism sector to the economy of Mizoram is also very less due to the geographical isolation of the State. The inter-state connectivity remains poor. For instance, it takes nearly four hours to cover 80 kilometers of distance between southern part of Mizoram capital Lunglei and Lawngtlai. Mizoram conducts virtually no trade with either the mainland or neighbouring countries. It was therefore imperative for the AEP to ‘bridge the distances’ physically and economically in Mizoram.

_Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project__(KMMTTP):_

 The most vital and visible manifestation of Act East Policy is the KMMTTP. TheKaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Projectis a project that will connect the eastern Indian seaport of KolkatawithSittweseaport inRakhine State, Myanmar by sea. In Myanmar, it will then link Sittwe seaport toPaletwa,Chin Statevia the Kaladan riverboat route, and then from Paletwa by road toMizoramstate in Northeast India. Originally, the project was scheduled to be completed by 2014 but it has not been completed till today.

**Challenges and Preparedness:**

1. _Slow Progress of the KMMTTP_ :

There are many factors which attributed the slow progress to the project which are (i) long rainy season which resulted in shorter duration of construction of roads in a year (ii) remoteness of the region in Mizoram which causes delays in the supply of fuel and spare parts, and further delaying the project.

 The factor which concerned with security is demand of compensation as many landlords in Lawngtlai are demanding compensation for the highway that supposedly passed over their lands and has resulted in blockades of the ongoing construction work on numerous occasions. Lawngtlai District Land Owners Association (LDLOA) was formed and commenced picketing against staff/workers of RDS Company and ARSS Company, Contractors engaged under KMMTTP on many occasions and sometimes blockade of road in protest against the alleged undue payment of compensation to LDLOA members.

1. _Militancy challenge in Myanmar_ :

Myanmar government was hesitant to begin KMMTTP work since the highway would pass through some areas where a rebel group called Arakan Army (AA) has a presence. R.D.S. Pvt. Ltd undertook road construction in between Zorinpui and Paletwa Myanmar and they were to construct 49 kms. stretch of road highways . This project would pass through Arakan Army (AA) Operational Area under Rakhine State. On the morning of 19.6.2020, while the construction work was going under the guard of Myanmar Army (MA), Arakan Army (AA) opened fire to Myanmar Army (MA), as per report some MA personnel sustained injury due to the attack. Manager and workers of company took shelter inside Mizoram and the works was suspended for a considerable length of time.

After the incident, resumption of the work was not allowed by Arakan Army (AA). It has been learnt that as long as India’s cooperate with Myanmar Army (MA), they would not allow continuing the work and demanded signing of tripartite agreement of representatives of Govt. of India, Official of Construction Company and Arakan Army (AA) in order to resume the work.

1. _Cross Border Crime_ :

There may be increase in cross border crimes due to better road connectivity after completion of KMMTTP. This may open door for illegal activities such as Arms Smuggling, Human Trafficking, Drugs Smuggling and illegal migration of foreigners due to the very strategic location of Mizoram. It would be necessary to beef up the security along Myanmar and Mizoram border in order to restrain cross border crime once the project is completed.

1. _Beefing up of Border Security_ :

The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime(FMR) between India and Myanmar allows Myanmarese nationals to enter up to 16 kms. into Mizoram Territory without any Visa restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border and BSF guard Indo-Bangladesh border. Mizoram shared 496.531 Kms. with Myanmar and 319.791 Kms. with Bangladesh. In order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the border of Mizoram and Myanmar.

1. _Setting up Battalion Headquarters_ :

The 3rd Indian Reserve Battalion under Mizoram police, who are currently deployed at Assam is planning to set up its Headquarters at Thingkah, Lawngtlai District. Construction work of infrastructural need is going on, and it is expected to be completed soon. Once they are stationed at the new headquarters, they will be an important asset to maintain peace and security in the southern part of Mizoram. They would be very useful in Maintenance of Law &amp; Order and guarding of international boundary and cross border crime.
