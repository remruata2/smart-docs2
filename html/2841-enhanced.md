No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/238

Dated: 4th April, 2019.

 In continuation of our Special Report No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/234 dated 3.4.2019. NGOCC held a meeting last night, i.e. 3.4.2019 @ 8:30 p.m at CYMA Office under the chairmanship of Pu Vanlalruata, Chairman which was attended by 18 (eighteen) members. The meeting deliberated on the letter of the Chief Secretary to the NGOCC over their intended boycott of MP Election, 2019 and organise a Total Bandh w.e.f. 8.4.2019 in protest against the ECI’s special treatment given to Mizoram Bru voters presently residing in Tripura Transit Camps, and the long pending Bru issue. The meeting expressed its gratitude towards the Government of Mizoram and the Ministry of Home Affairs for their commitment to complete the Bru repatriation process in 2019 and to take initiatives to end the special assistance given to the Brus who do not want to be repatriated. The Committee expressed its confidence towards the efforts proposed to be taken by the Government and hence called-off its proposal to boycott MP Election, 2019 along with an indefinite Total Bandh w.e.f. 8.4.2019. The NGOCC further expressed its expectation over the Government of Mizoram and expressed its desire to see to the fulfilment of the commitment made by the Government.

 In the meantime, information received indicated that student bodies, viz. MZP and MSU, constituent members of the NGOCC were not fully satisfied with the call-off of their proposed agitation but had to acquiesce since it will be hard to organise such activity by themselves. Situation kept under close watch.
