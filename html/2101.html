<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mizoram is situated at a strategic location, bordering two countries, viz., Bangladesh and Myanmar. Act East Policy of Indian Government put due importance on opening up of trade and communications with Myanmar. Works on the KMMTTP is currently underway and Free Movement Regime is intended to be operationalised in full spirit, both in letter and spirit. Due to its strategic location, Mizoram is a conduit for both arms and drugs smuggling over the years. There have been significant seizures of illegal trans-border movement of goods, drugs and arms over the past years. Though Mizoram is among the most peaceful state in the country with no active and hostile insurgent groups, constant watch has to be maintained by security forces, especially along the international borders. The issue of illegal immigrations from Bangladesh needs to be constantly kept on watch. At the same time, use of Mizoram as a transit route from arms and drugs smuggling is also something that calls for constant vigil along the Mizoram-Myanmar border. Once the KMMTTP is in operation, it can bring in a host of challenges from the security point of view. Deployment of adequate security force and other enforcement agencies will assume paramount importance.</span></span></span></span></p>
