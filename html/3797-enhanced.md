**Insurgency in North-Eastern States- way forward**

Northeast India is often described as 'Asia in miniature' where the brown and yellow races meet and mingle. This region reportedly has over 220 ethnic groups having their distinct culture and identity. Insurgency in Northeast Indiainvolves multiple armed factions/groups. Some factions favour a separate state while others seekregional autonomy. Some extreme groups demand complete independence.

Insurgency in the northeast is the product of more than one factor. The root causes of the present situation are to be found in many areas of political, social and economic realm. Most importantly too, the historical past also throws significant light on the overall discontent and grievances of the people towards the Indian Government.

The dawn of independence on the Indian horizon saw India emerged a sovereign independent state, after years of freedom struggle. Except for the Assam plains, the hill areas were left totally untouched by the national struggle for independence. The sense of nationalism or patriotic fervor which was a binding force elsewhere in the country was not felt in the hills. The north-east was virtually isolated from the events leading to independence.

The people of the northeast, particularly in Nagaland and Mizoram saw this as an opportunity to revert back to their old ways of independent living. They had never felt to be a part of India even under the British rule, and with independence, they saw no reason to be under the Indian government. Thus, when India attained her independence, the tribal leaders of the north-east raised the demand for autonomy to preserve what was left of their tribal heritage. They wanted the British to leave the tribals to their own rule once they left. The threat perception to their culture and customs under Indian rule assumed significance with the imminent transfer of power to the new Indian government.

Consequently, when in 1947, the insulated hill tribals became a part of independent India without self-consciously involving them in the struggle for independence a section of the newly educated tribal elites questioned their integration with independent India. It was in this context that the question of independence and secession of the Nagas and later of the Mizos emerged. Though their political integration with India was more or less complete, their emotional integration and identification with pan-Indian nationalism remained weak, nagging and incomplete.

The determination of the hill tribals was clearly evident when the Naga National Council (NNC) declared independence on 14 August, 1947 just a day earlier under the leadership of Phizo. A few years later, the Mizo National Front(MNF) on 1 March, 1966 declared independence and an underground Government of the MNF was formed.

The strategic location of the Northern India and the access of the disaffected group to China, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan and Nepal, together with material and moral support of foreign intelligence agencies to these groups have facilitated insurgency in the Northeastern region. Safe sanctuaries to hide, material and moral support from the locals across the borders fuel the insurgency in North East India.

Transnational linkages have remained a crucial force multiplier for the insurgents in north-east India. While the Naga insurgents received patronage from the Chinese in the 1960s and 1970s, safe bases in countries, including Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, have been used by the outfits to sustain themselves.

The Golden Triangle (comprising Myanmar, Laos and Thailand) has provided an economic boom for the insurgent groups to sustain themselves. Easy availability of small arms in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar has been another factor behind the sustenance of insurgency in the North East India.

****State specific Conflict Profiles****

**Arunachal Pradesh:**__

National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang(NSCN(K) was active in Tirap district. The NSCN(K) however refused to re-sign the agreement in March 2015 and subsequently carried out one of the most devastating attacks in Manipur on the Indian Army. National Liberation Council of Taniland(NLCT) is active along the Assam - Arunachal Pradesh border and its members belong to theTani groups of peoplewhich is demandingTaniland.

**Assam:**

There are several other factors for insurgency in the state, which include the influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and the perceived inability to address the issue, as well as tensions between religious and linguistic groups that sustain campaign by local tribal communities for greater autonomy within the state. However the main conflict is over the issue of illegal immigration.

Resentment against perceived annexation of Manipur to India has sustained the insurgency over the decades. There have been allegations of sections of local administration working in collusion with the insurgent groups, allowing the latter to run parallel systems of governance. The lack of economic development has allowed such outfits to project themselves as a viable source for income for disgruntled youth, ensuring a steady supply of militant recruits.

**Meghalaya:******

The first militant outfit to emerge in the region was theHynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council(HALC), it was formed in 1992, aiming to protect the interests of Meghalaya's indigenous population from the rise of non-tribal ("Dkhar") immigration

**Mizoram:**__

The state is a success story in the region for resolving a long-running insurgency and fostering development subsequently. The government and the separatist Mizo National Front in 1986 signed a peace-deal. This was followed by the granting of statehood and ensured stability in Mizoram.

****HPC-D****

TheHmar People's Convention-Democracy is the offspring of the Hmar People's Convention (HPC), which entered into agreement with the Government of Mizoram in 1994 resulting in the formation of Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) in North Mizoram. Their recruited cadres are from the States where the Hmar people are spread - Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya.The HPC(D) is demanding a separate administrative unit under the SixthSchedule of the Constitution of India.

**Sikkim**_:_

The state has a comparatively higher rate of development as compared to the region and has also been particularly successful in striking a balance between various ethnic groups (mainly the Lepchas, Bhutiyas and Nepalis). The rate of development and relatively higher rates of employment have led to sustained stability in the state.

**Tripura:**__

The demographic composition of the state was altered following partition when an influx of refugees from the erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) occurred. The resultant tensions gave rise to the Tripura National Volunteers’ extremist outfit. However government intervention and the setting up of a Schedule Council which brought tribal areas under land reform and other such programmes have reduced the appeal of such groups.

**Insurgency of North East India – a way forward**

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to authorize the 9th June,2015 cross-border strikes against the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K) in Myanmarcould prove to be an important step in the evolution of India’s counter-terror strategy. By striking at insurgent camps inside the Myanmar territory, the Central Government had demonstrated its willingness for tough action in dealing with terrorism and matters of national security. But this indeed is the first time that the army and government have publicly acknowledged crossing the border, in pursuit of insurgents. The goal now should be to put together a well-thought-out strategy to weaken insurgency in the North East.

The Naga Peace Accord (a framework agreement as it has been termed) signed between the National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and the Government of India on 3 August ,2015 heralds a new beginning of hope for resolving the insurgency of North East (as it has been signed with the strongest insurgent group of North East India).

However, an assessment of North East’s security situation reveals the formation of the 'United National Liberation Front of West South East Asia (UNLFWSEA)', a grouping of nine militant groups, including the NSCN – K, and the ULFA faction of Paresh Baruah. Their combined and approximate strength of 4000 to 4500 is spread over 40-45 camps, across the thick jungles of Myanmar. Neutralising these camps is going to be a long haul. In the short term, these terror groups in order to deter further military action will seek to strike back at Indian targets. Relentless operations even across borders must be undertaken to neutralise such possibility.

Over a period of time, insurgent groups lost their ideology, mass support and got disillusioned with their leadership, resulting in large defections and surrenders. However, periodic incidents of violence, extortion, bomb blasts are still being witnessed in these areas. The security establishment has been working constantly to dismantle the insurgent framework in the region and have achieved considerable success. But new threats like Maoism and Islamist militancy are raising its head in this region and the government needs to develop a strong action plan to eradicate this menace before it spreads its tentacles in the whole region. Along with security measures, it is imperative that the government also take steps for developing the poorly developed interior areas of the state. A dedicated development plan along with tough security measures would surely be able to curb the menace of insurgency in the North East India.
