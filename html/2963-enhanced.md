****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/62

Dated: 29th January, 2019.

In continuation of our Special Report No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/42, dated 20.01.2019: Consequent upon their meeting with Pu Neihchungnunga, IPS, DIG (CID/SR) on 19.01.2019, Lawngtlai District Land Owners Association (LDLOA) had deferred the date of commencement of their intended indefinite stay of all construction works under Kaladan Multi Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) from 20.01.2019 to 01.02.2019 to give the new Government time to study the grievances of LDLOA and look into the matter in connection with their demand for immediate disbursement of their compensation claims.

 Information received indicated that LDLOA will be having a meeting tomorrow, i.e. 30.01.2019 with Pu N. Chakhai, MCS, Deputy Commissioner, Lawngtlai District at his office chamber which will also be attended by Senior Revenue Officer, Lai Autonomous District Council to discuss about the present situation. Information further indicated that the leaders of LDLOA are intending to come to Aizawl on 02.02.2019 to meet higher authorities prior to which they claimed not to take any action.

Pro-active action by higher authority to resolve the issue is urgently needed as another call for stay of all construction works under KMMTTP by LDLOA could not be ruled out and the Contractors of the project will most likely be unwilling to perform any work even under the protection of Police. Convening a meeting with leaders of LDLOA by concerned authority when they come to Aizawl on 02.02.2019 is considered very convenient for initiating such effort.
