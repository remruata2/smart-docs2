****BRU REFUGEES PROBLEM VIS-À-VIS SURRENDER OF BRU MILITANT GROUPS AND THEIR RESETTLEMENT****

****THE BIRTH OF BRU MILITANT GROUP****

****BNLF: The Brus (otherwise Riangs) are the Nomadic tribe inhabiting the area scattered in the western belt of Mizoram, bordering Bangladesh and Tripura State. As far as their history is concerned, they entered into Mizoram since 1940's moving from one place to another in search of jhum cultivation.****

****The on-going episode of Bru crisis which has given rise to by the killing of Pu Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher at Persang village in Dampa Forest Sanctuary on 21.10.1997 has had a long impact on social, economic and political condition of the Brus. He was shot dead by Bru militants called the Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF), who snatched away .22 Rifles and WT Set Pu Lalzawmliana had carried. The news of the killing of Pu Lalzawmliana by BNLF shook and engulfed Mizoram and ignited the already volatile atmosphere prevailing in the area due to the demand for Autonomous District Council for the Brus. As a result of this brutal killing, tension began to envelope and escalate in the surrounding areas, which further snowballed into burning down of Bru houses at Tuipuibari village by the mob on 24.10.1997 evening itself. In the meantime, the BNLF had also threatened the Bru Community to leave Mizoram for their operational convenience. The Bru populace had little choice in the process and thousand of them fled to Tripura State. This was followed by massive burning down of Bru houses, for which the deployment of Police and BSF was re-quisitioned to prevent the Brus from leaving Mizoram and the mob setting Bru houses on fire, but in vain.****

**This incident (killing of Lalzawmliana by Bru militants, BNLF) has resulted in the large scale migration of Brus from Mizoram to Tripura for fear of possible repermission. Following this, there are 31919 Bru refugees presently living in Tripura in the following 6(six) Refugee camps:**

**1) Naisingpara 2) Hazachera**

**3) Ashapara 4) Kaiskau**

**5) Khakchang 6) Hamsa**

****Contrary to the members of Bru refugees as furnished by Tripura State as mentioned above, so far only 10688 Bru refugees have been identified to be genuine Brus of Mizoram by Deputy Commissioner, Aizawl (as on May 2001). At the same time, 1617 Bru refugees have already returned to Mizoram(as on October 2000) and certain number of Bru refugee families have also returned to Mizoram on their own will(As reported by Bru VCP of Tuirum and Tuipuibari on 3.5.2000).****

****Later on, Govt. of Mizoram initiated peace talk with leaders of BNLF w.e.f. 7.9.2001 and after 12 rounds of peace talk between government of Mizoram and BNLF, MOU was signed between BNLF and Govt. of Mizoram on 26.4.2005. And in pursuance of MOU signed on 26.4.2005, the 195 strong BNLF cadres and their family members have been temporarily sheltered at Sidon Transit Camp, Tuipuibari. Altogether a total members of 950 including all BNLF cadres and families have been provided free ration at the rate of Rs.10/- per adult and Rs.5/- per minor per day.****

**Resettlement: Finally Govt. of Mizoram had resettled BNLF and their family members in the following villages as under:**
