**BRU MILITANCY**

1. **BRU NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (BNLF)**

The BNLF was formed on 9.11.1996 at Tuirum to strengthen the repeated demands of Autonomous District Council for Bru people living in western belt of Mizoram by Bru National Union.

 The founder President of BNLF Vanlalliana went to Bangladesh in the month of November 1996 and sought the advice of NLFT leader DonuKolai (the then Dy. Chief of Army of NLFT) and with his advice and guidance, BNLF was set up, arms training and procurement of weapons have been arranged by the NLFT.

**Activities :**

 A Conference convened by BNU which was held at Saipuilui Village of Mamit District on 23-24 Sept 1997 passed a resolution demanding separate Autonomous District Council for Brus in Western Belt of Mizoram. Mizos living in this belt reacted immediately against the said resolution as a result of which the situation in this area had become tense between the two communities.

 To make matter worst, PuLalzawmliana, Wild Life Game Watcher of Forest Department was killed by some unknown miscreants and his two companion viz. Jutendro and (2) Ngaihdama had also been abducted on 21.10.1997. The two abducted persons resurfaced at Dampa Sanctuary on 24.10.1997 and revealed that the deceased was murdered by 10 armed Bru militant group.

 The general public of Bru Community were also threatened by Bru militants to leave Mizoram and to escape the wrath of Police and Mizos due to the murder of the Forest Game Watcher. As a result, a large number of Bru people fled Mizoram in the last part of 1997 and they settled at Tripura North District as refugees.

Numerous activities like robbing, assault of innocent civilians and endless demand letter of money have been served to the people of Mizos living in the western belt of Mizoram by the BNLF.

**Peace Talk with BNLF :**

 To end mistrust amongst different communities and militant activities of BNLF, Govt. of Mizoram initiated Peace Talk with leaders of BNLF w.e.f. 7.9.2001 and after 12 rounds of peace talks between Govt. of Mizoram and BNLF, anMoU was signed between BNLF and Govt. of Mizoram on 26.4.2005.

**Arms laying and temporary shelter for BNLF and family members :**

 In pursuance of MoU signed on 26.4.2005, the 195 strong BNLF cadres and their family members have been temporarily sheltered at Sidon Transit Camp, Tuipuibari. Altogether a total members of 950 including all BNLF cadres and families have been provided free ration.

**Resettlement :**

****Various problems created by the BLFM outfit came in the way of resettlement of BNLF as a result of which the BNLF and their family members had to stay in the Camp beyond the stipulated time.

Finally the Govt. of Mizoram had resettled BNLF and their family members in the following villages as under:-

These Ex-BNLF cadres were issued ration card in their respective villages and also enrolled in the electoral roll and also issued Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) except those resettled in Tumpanglui. A school under SSA Scheme was also opened particularly in PathianTlang and Tumpanglui.

**II. BRU LIBERATION FRONT OF MIZORAM (BLFM)**

**The Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM) was formed in December, 2001 at Naisingpara refugee camp reportedly at the instance of NLFT (BM) under the leadership of Vanlalliana founder president of BNLF who was overthrown by his own men.**

 At the initial stage of forming the BLFM, the first ever major activities launched by BLFM was kidnapping of one Maxi Cab driver Lalfamkima on 1.4.2003 demanding huge amount of ransom money. This was followed by a series of activities like serving of demand letters to Mizoram villages bordering to Tripura.

With the signing of Memorandum of Understanding between BNLF (a premier Bru Insurgent Outfit) and GOM, the BLFM cadres were also expected to come over ground and join the mainstream to enjoy rehabilitation and other facilities at par with BNLF. However, this hope was shattered by the BLFM themselves by committing kidnapping of two employees of Teirei Mini Hydel Project from the dam site on 8.8.2005.

The BLFM further intensified their activities inside Mizoram villages by forcible collection of donations from innocent civilians of Mizoram resulting into Counter Operation by Mizoram Police. There have been four armed encounter since then wherein three BLFM cadres sustained bullet injuries. On 11.1.2006, the BLFM on their way back to their camp open deliberate firing towards the MAP post of New Kawnpui located at Tripura - Mizoram border.

 With the initiative of 36 AR, Kanchanpur, 38 Nos. of BLFM cadres including Vice President, General Secretary and other senior officers with 14 nos. of different types of arms surrendered to Govt. of Mizoram.

**Surrendering of BLFM Splinter Group :**

 The BLFM is a very ill-organised militant group from the very outset. A splinter group of BLFM headed by A. Zoramthanga, former Vice President and Lalrinkima, Gen. Secretary numbering 38 surrendered to the Govt. with weapons on 16.3.2006 followed by 4 cadres on 6.7.2006 and 11 cadres on 17.8.2006. Altogether 53 cadres of A. Zoramthanga faction of BLFM surrendered before Govt. of Mizoram by the turn of September, 2006.

**Rehabilitation and resettlement :**

 Govt. of Mizoram rehabilitated this group with Cash Assistance and Housing Assistance at par with the BNLF surrenderees. They were resettled at Pangbalkawn village by purchasing a plot of land for them. However, most of them have returned to refugee camps in Tripura except 6 of them who resettled at Chhimluang, Saihapui and Pangbalkawn itself.

**Arrest of President, etc.**

In the aftermath of the surrender of 38 BLFM cadres, four BLFM top brass leaders viz. (1) Vanlalliana, President, (2) Vanrama, Vice President (3) RomawiaMeska, COAS and (4) Lallawma, SS Capt. were arrested on 20.4.2006 in a joint operation of Mizoram Police SB and Assam Rifles of Kanchanpur code name Operation Black Hound which was another major blow to the BLFM.

**Surrender of 804 strong cadres of BLFM :**

Out of frustration due to arrest of their top leaders and surrender of 53 cadres of BLFM, the remaining 804 strong members of BLFM decided to lay down their arms and surrender to the Govt. unconditionally. As such, the remaining BLFM cadres, with the active participation of Assam Rifles laid down their arms on 26.10.2006 and were temporarily sheltered in two Transit Camps viz. Damparengpui and Tuipuibari. Free ration have been provided as per scale which was sanctioned by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India. However, the state Govt. has also supplement the sanction as the surrenderees have to stay in the transit camp over and above the anticipated period.

**Identification of surrendered BLFM****:**

****Although the Govt. accepted the BLFM cadres as surrendered militant, identification of bonafide Mizoram Bru was felt necessary for their further resettlement in Mizoram. In this regard, Govt. officials and NGOs were sent to their respective Transit Camp and out of 804 BLFM cadres, 731 were identified as genuine Mizoram Brus.

**Resettlement****:**

 The Govt. of Mizoram took all possible steps to resettle the surrendered BLFM identified as a bonafide resident of Mizoram with their family members at the places selected by concerned District Authorities. Housing Assistance to the tune Rs. 30,000/- each was disbursed to them in two installments.

The Govt. of Mizoram has taken various steps for the permanent settlement of the surrendered BLFM which could not be materialized due to the absence of active co-operation of the leader of BLFM in respect of proposals for their resettlement.

The meeting held in the office chamber of Chief Secretary of Mizoram on 29.8.08 reiterated the need for actionable plan for settlement of surrendered BLFM and District concerned administration are instructed to go ahead with the allocation of house site at the places earmarked for their resettlement.

The surrendered BLFM in the transit camp were issued Job card under NREGS Scheme as far as practicable.

**Due to the proactive steps taken by the Mizoram Police, various Bru militants as mentioned above are no longer active in Mizoram and they are now considered defunct organisations.**

**BRU REFUGEES & BRU REPATRIATION**

**I. GENESIS**

 The BNU conference held in September, 1997 at Saipuilui village in Mamit District adopted a resolution for creation of Autonomous District Council for Brus in the western part of Mizoram which was strongly objected by the Mizo community in the concerned area. At the same time a militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) which was formed in 1996 under the leadership of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became more and more active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news about the killing had spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by BNU. Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram at the instance of the BNLF for their operational convenience.

 The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government.

 The Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF) who took arms against the state of Mizoram since 1996 laid down their arms to the Govt. of Mizoram on 25th July, 2005 after 13(thirteen) rounds of Peace Talks between Govt. of Mizoram and BNLF. As many as 195 BNLF surrendered. The other Bru militant outfit called Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram(BLFM) formed in the year 2000 after they break away from parent outfit BNLF, took arms against Mizoram till they surrendered to the Govt. of Mizoram on 26th October, 2006. As many as 804 BLFM cadres surrendered and were given same package as a rehabilitation plan with their parent body BNLF.
