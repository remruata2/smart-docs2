Subj  : Threat Perception Report.

Ref : MSB/CB/B-19(A)/241 Dated 05.04.2019

Sir,

 With reference to the letter no. and subject cited above, I hereby submit my assessment of security threat perception report in respect of Pu Vanlalmawia, Addl. District &amp; Sessions Judge.

According to the petitioner, the jurisdiction vested in him is original criminal jurisdiction with Sessions power and that the threat perception is no less than other Hon’ble Judges. Moreover, while functioning as Addl. District &amp; Sessions Judge, he has awarded life term in quite a few cases. Besides that, according to the petitioner, there is every possibility of receiving threat to his life in or outside his Hon’ble Court, but upon further enquiry, the petitioner had not received any direct or indirect life threatening words or received any threat report from his staffs.

It is concluded that the threat perceived either direct or indirect is minimal at present, but taking into account the nature of his work, he may be provided 1 (One) Personal Security Officer (PSO).

 Yours faithfully,

 SI (KC. JOSEPH VANLALPEKA)
