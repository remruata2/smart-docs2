****SECURITY SCENARIO OF MIZORAM****

****WITH REFERENCE TO MP ELECTION, 2024****

Mizoram, like many other states has face many security challenges including those challenges which are similar to other Indian states as well as challenges which are specific to the state or area. Mizoram shares an international border with Myanmar and Bangladesh and an interstate boundary with Assam, Manipur and Tripura. After the signing of the Peace Accord in 1986 and her subsequent statehood, Mizoram has largely been a peaceful state. However, some of the current security challenges as well as challenges which may arise considering the upcoming MP General Election, 2024 may be summarized as follows:

**A. INSURGENCY:**

**Internal-**

 After the signing of Memorandum of Settlement (MOS) between the Government of Mizoram and Hmar People’s Convention (Democratic) HPC (D) on 12.04.2018, the founder president Lalhminthanga Sanate and few of his trusted cadres who refused to go over ground continued creating minor security issues mostly in the Hmar community dominated areas by involving in criminal intimidations and extortion cases. On 05.11.2023, an unknown person claiming himself to be a cadre of HPC (D) through a telephone call, had threaten the Village Council President of Khawlian Village, Saitual District to persuade his villagers to refrain from casting their votes for some political parties in the MLA General Election, 2023. However, the culprit, Ramchanlova (52) alias RC Singson s/o Liankhawsang of Thenzawl, Mizoram, a close alias of Lalhmingthanga Sanate and a former Army Chief of HPC (D),

was arrested on 19.01.2024 vide Saitual PS Case No. 50/23 06.11.2023 u/s 120B/506/384/511/171'C' IPC by Saitual Police with the assistance of CID (SB).

Recent reports stated that a group of four to five persons wearing a camouflage uniform who are suspected to be cadres of Hmar People’s Convention (Democratic), HPC (D), (Lahmingthanga Sanate faction) had stopped Non-Mizo traders in between NEEPCO, Tuirial Hydel Project establishments and Mauchar Village, Aizawl District and collected money to the tune of Rs. 500 to 2000 from these Non-Mizo traders who are mostly dealing with buying of broom grasses from Mizoram and continued their illegal collection of money as late at 10.03.2024.

However, there is no indication that these miscreants possessed or displayed any arms during such stopping and collection of money. After continued efforts, CID (SB) has identified 07 (Seven) cadres of HPC (D) who are strongly suspected of involving in illegal collection of money at Mauchar Village area.

The illegal collection of money by these suspected cadres of HPC (D) Lalhmingthanga Sanate faction or their movement across the border if unchecked may resulted in recruitment of more cadres which may post a more serious challenge for the state security. The possibility of making intimidating calls or attempt to coerce voters mainly the Hmar community to cast their votes in favour of a particular political party or candidate in the upcoming MP General Election 2024 could not be ruled out but very unlikely.

 **External:**

The clashes between the Myanmar Army and the civil volunteer which started since the military coup in 01.02.2021 continued till date. Latest report indicated that armed conflict between the Myanmar Army and the People’s Defence Force (PDF) had taken place at Kalaymeo Township as late as 2nd March, 2024 claiming many lives both from the Army and the PDF. The recently formed Chinland Government in 01.02.2024 had a meeting at Camp Victoria, its Headquarters on 07.03.2024 wherein the 15 (fifteen) Council of Ministers and the Chief Minister of the Chinland Government as well as leaders of NGOs were present. The meeting decided to invite some of the ethnic groups of Chin state who has not yet join the Chinland Government and also discussed ways of raising funds for the newly formed government. However, some of the councils and committees representing Chin State are expressing their disapproval of the Chinland Government. The hostility between the ethnic armed groups is reportedly increased after the formation of the Chinland Government.

Arakan Army has been attacking the Myanmar Army camps located in and around Paletwa Township since the last part of 2023. As per latest inputs, 22 Myanmar Army camp inside Rakhine State, Myanmar has been captured by the Arakan Army and the flag of Arakan Army had been hoisted at Paletwa Township to mark their dominance of the area. Inputs indicated that Arakan Army has no intention of disrupting the KMMTTP within their operational area. On the contrary, the spokesperson of Arakan Army/United League of Arakan (ULA) had recently stated that Arakan Army will not interfere on the ongoing project of KMMTTP and expected a good relation with the Indian Government

However, it is reported that the Khumi National Defence Army (KNDA) did not appreciate the hoisting of Arakan Army flag at Paletwa Township. The Khumis had been claiming the areas of Paletwa Township as their ancestral home and latest inputs suggested that the Khumis from different part of the country are being recruited to join the Khumi National Defence Army (KNDA) to overthrow the Arakan Army from Paletwa Township.

 Kuki Chin National Front (KNF/KNA) of Bangladesh has been demanding a separate administration for the Kuki Chin community of Chittagong Hills Tract of Bangladesh and had been fighting the Bangladesh Government through its armed wing, Kuki Chin National Army since 2017. However, since the latter part of 2023, the Bangladesh Government initiated a peace talk and called for a cease fire with the KNF/KNA. On 5th March 2024, the 2nd meeting between Kuki Chin National Front (KNF) and Peace Establishment Committee was held at Bethel Para Community Hall of Ruma Upazila, Bandarban District. However, there is no significant progress at the peace talk and 22nd April 2024 was fixed as a possible date for a 3rd peace meeting.

**B. BORDER SECURITY AND REFUGEE ISSUE:**

**Bangladesh-**

Though the Indo-Bangladesh border is fenced in many areas, the international border is very porous in terms of illegal immigration or overstaying. However, at present, the issue of unauthorised villages within Lunglei District which often create law and order issue in the past had been settled between the State Government, YMA and the alleged illegal settlers. The recent allegation of establishment of military training camps of PCJSS (Santi Bahini) inside Mizoram along the Indo-Bangladesh border could not be verified after enquiries were conducted by district police as well as CID (SB) while presence of temporary transit camps in few places under Lunglei District cannot be ruled out. Nonetheless, these transit camps were used only as a temporary place of storage of essential goods procured from Mizoram to be transported to Bangladesh and unlikely post any threat or security issue with regards to the process of MP General Election, 2024.

In the past the armed clashes between the KNF and Bangladesh Army had resulted in the influx of refugee from Bangladesh mainly from the Bawm community seeking asylum in Mizoram. However, the ongoing peace talk between the KNF and the Bangladesh has significantly decreases the number of Bangladesh Nationals seeking asylum in Mizoram. The number of Bangladesh Nationals residing in relief camp in Lawngtlai District as on 08.03.2024 is as under:

| **Sl. No.** | **Locality** | **No. Persons** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Parva-III | 233 |
|  | Vathuampui | 296 |
|  | Mautlang | 66 |
|  | Chamdur P-I | 120 |
|  | Hmawngbu | 140 |
|  | Bungtlang South | 98 |
|  | Hruitezawl | 75 |
|  | Hmunnuam | 30 |
|  | Tuthumhnar | 109 |
|  | **Total** | **1167** |


 ****

******Myanmar-**

The continued clashes between the Myanmar Army and different ethnic armed groups had resulted in influx of refugees from Myanmar mainly from Chin State. The current status of Myanmar refugees in Myanmar as per Home Department, Government of Mizoram (02.03.2024) is as under:

| **Sl. No** | **District** | **Total numbers of Refugees** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Aizawl | 3391 |
| 2. | Lunglei | 2009 |
| 3. | Champhai | 12484 |
| 4. | Lawngtlai | 6039 |
| 5. | Siaha | 6044 |
| 6. | Hnahthial | 1101 |
| 7. | Serchhip | 343 |
| 8. | Kolasib | 139 |
| 9. | Saitual | 75 |
| 10. | Khawzawl | 86 |
| 11. | Mamit | 465 |
| **Total** |  | **32,176** |


However, due to the resent order by the State Administrative Council (Myanmar Army) of compulsory joining of Army, a few numbers of Myanmar Nationals mainly residing in Rangoon and Tahan had left the country to escape joining of the army. Some of these young people leaving the country had entered or ply through Mizoram, Zokhawthar and Aizawl. However, the number of such persons entering or plying through Mizoram is reported to be not more than 150 persons.

It is also reported that a few number of Myanmar Nationals consisting of around 30 persons had entered Hruitezawl Village in Lawntlai District, Mizoram on 04.03.2024 due to the clash between the Myanmar Army and Arakan Army near their Village in Myanmar.

Also, the arm conflict between the Arakan Army and the Khumi National Defence Force (KNDA) if occurred could resulted in influx of Myanmar Nationals into the southern side of Mizoram, India.

 The Government of India’s decision of scrapping of Free Movement Regime and construction of border fencing along the Indo-Myanmar border is not welcomed by almost all the NGOs and political parties of Mizoram. Even though many individuals seems to welcome the approach, the project of construction of border fencing will faced many protest and opposition from many villagers and organizations along the border which may create law and order issues. Peace Accord MNF Returnee Association (PAMRA) had recently openly stated that it will stage a demonstration in the border villages along with the other north eastern states against the move of the central government.

**C. DRUGS AND ILLEGAL TRADE:**

Mizoram shares an unfenced porous international border with Myanmar which is often taken advantage by drug smugglers and illegal traders. Due to the long stretch border and porosity in the absence of physical barrier combined with Free Movement Regime, people across the border can move freely cross the border at many locations resulting in an easy route for smugglers. The increase in the illegal trafficking of narcotic drugs in the recent time can be attributed due to the ethnic clash in Manipur which did not allows trafficking these contraband items through the state and increasing demand of fund by many ethnic armed groups of Myanmar who are fighting the State Administrative Council to overthrow the Myanmar Army from the current political administration.

In between July 2023 to February, 2024, CID (SB) had been involved in the seizure of the following narcotic drugs:

1. **Heroin –**3.640 kilograms valued at Rs. 1,09,20,000/- in the international market.
2. **Crystal Methamphetamine –**23.208****kilograms valued at Rs. 69,62,40,000/- in the international market.

The transportation and use of IMFL in the state is expected to increase during the MP election process as witnessed in the past but not to the extend as in the MLA General Elections. However, increase in import of IMFL into the state and public nuisance cases cannot be ruled out during the MP Election, 2024.
