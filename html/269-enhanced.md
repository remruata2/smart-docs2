Sir,

With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, threat assessment in respect of 3(three) MLA candidates for the upcoming 7th Mizoram Legislative Assembly Election-2013 had been conducted and ascertained that none of the candidates received any direct personal threats from any anti-social elements. However, it is highly recommended that necessary PSO may be provided to all candidates as a pre-emptive measure against potential threats from any political rivalry in the run up of the election-2013.

Yours faithfully,
