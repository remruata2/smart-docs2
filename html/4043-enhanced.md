****WRITE-UP FOR MEETING ON 13.02.2025****

i). Deployment of CISF at Lengpui Airport (Aizawl), Mizoram :

  N/A

**ii). IMB Fence and Road Project :**

  **IMB Fence**

 Mizoram shares a 510-kilometer-long border with Myanmar, which remains unfenced and porous. Six districts in the state adjoin the international border, with Champhai district sharing the longest border with Myanmar.

 On February 28, 2024, the Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Indian government’s proposal to build a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and to abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR). Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution expresses concerns that these measures would negatively impact the Zo ethnic communities, which have been historically divided by the border established during British colonial rule. The Assembly contends that strengthening this division with additional barriers would disturb the livelihoods and social connections of the border communities.

Peaceful Protest Rally against the Government of India's decision to fenced Indo-Myanmar Border (IMB) and abrogation of Free Movement Regime (FMR) was organised by Zo Reunification Organisation (ZORO) at Lal Mual, Vaphai on 16.05.2024 @ 7:00 a.m. The peace rally participated by around 280 (two hundred eighty) persons ended peacefully at around 08:00 a.m. The Peaceful Rally was also organised at Zokhawthar on 16.05.2024 @ 11:00 a.m. and participated by almost around 1000 (one thousand) demonstrators.

**KMMTTP**

 The Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) is a strategic infrastructure initiative by the Government of India. It involves a multimodal transport route that combines land, river, and sea segments to connect Northeast India with Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal. The route covers a distance of 882.21 kilometers and includes multiple modes of transportation.

**Lawngtlai to Zorinpui (Mizoram)**: land route 87.51 kms.

**Zorinpui Border to Kaletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 45 kms.

**Kaletwa to Paletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 60.70 kms.

**Paletwa to Sittwe (Myanmar)**: 150 km river route.

**Sittwe to Kolkata Port (Bay of Bengal)**: 539 km sea route.

 As of June 2024, construction of the KMMTTP land route within Mizoram is complete, although it is occasionally disrupted by landslides due to heavy rainfall. Meanwhile, owing to ongoing conflicts in Myanmar, only about 10 kilometers of earthwork has been completed on the land route between Zorinpui and Paletwa by the Myanmar New Power Construction Company, the firm assigned to the project.

 Since February 2024, the Arakan Army, which primarily consists of ethnic Arakanese from Myanmar's Rakhine State, has reportedly taken control of most of Rakhine State, including some parts of Chin State. This control extends over the proposed route of the KMMTTP within Myanmar, with the exception of Sittwe. However, due to ongoing clashes between the Myanmar Army and resistance forces elsewhere in Myanmar, the Arakan Army and the civilians in Rakhine State have become heavily reliant on goods and petroleum products transported largely through Mizoram, notably Lawngtlai and Siaha Districts. Concurrently, tensions between the Arakan Army and Chin ethnic armed groups in Myanmar have led the Central Young Lai Association (CYLA) to ban the transport of essential goods and petroleum oil into Myanmar, in solidarity with their Chin counterparts since April 2024. Currently, the ban is restricted only to the transportation of petroleum oil and fertilizers through Lawngtlai District.

**iii). Entry and Exit points along IMB :**

The Indian government has introduced new regulations to oversee movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). On December 24, 2024, the MHA announced a revised protocol that decreases the Free Movement Regime (FMR) range, shrinking it from 16 km to 10 km. Despite Union Home Minister Amit Shah's earlier statement in February of the previous year, suggesting the FMR would be abolished, a formal notification has yet to be issued.

Security along the 510-km border has been intensified, and now residents residing within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border must secure a Border Pass for travel. The new regulations restrict the movement of individuals from 16 km under the previous FMR to 10 km now, on either side. Only those residing in the "border area"—defined as within 10 km on either side—are eligible to apply for the "Border Pass" for up to a seven-day stay; such pass-holders are required to return it at the same crossing point where it was issued. Residents of villages beyond the "border areas" (the 10-km zone) and citizens of any third country are ineligible for the Border Pass. . These new guidelines came into force from 30.12.2024, at Zokhawthar and Hnahlan, located in Champhai District, along the Mizoram-Myanmar border and till 06.02.2025, the number of person entered from Myanmar to India is 2139 and India to Myanmar is 34 at Zokhawthar, person entered from Myanmar to India is 26 and India to Myanmar is 17 at Hnahlan. The Zokhawthar and Hnahlan is pilot site for new entry and Exit point.

**PHASE-I:**Entry and Exit point along with Indo-Myanmar Border in Mizoram is supposed to start from 31.12.2024 in these places:-

| S/No | District | Name of Crossing Points | Closest BP | Closest COB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Lawngtlai | Zochachhuah | BP-09 | COB Zorinpui/20 AR |
| 2 | Lawngtlai | Hruitezawl | BP-08 | COB Zorinpui/20 AR |
| 3 | Lawngtlai | Laitlang | BP-08 | COB Zorinpui/20AR |


But the identified check gates in each of these areas is deemed too far from the villages and a meeting on 21.01.2025 at 05:15 pm held under the chairmanship of Secretary (BM), MHA on the entry/Exit points along Indo-Myanmar Border(IBM) resolved that it must be re-verified. After the verification, the same duty point for Entry/Exit point as proposed is approved and SP Lawngtlai posted 2 police personnel in each of these 3 places.

**PHASE-II :** In the below mention places check gates of Entry and Exit point will be implemented in the course of time.

| **S/No** | **District** | **Name of Crossing Points** | **Closest BP** | **Closest COB** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Saitual | Mimbung-Tuisa River | BP-32 | COB Mimbung/2AR |
| 2 | Saitual | Hiangmun-Tuisa River | BP-31&amp;32 | COB Mimbung/2AR |
| 3 | Champhai | Bulfekzawl | BP-27 | COB Zokhawthar/42 AR |
| 4 | Champhai | Vaphai | BP-26 | POB Vaphai/42 AR |
| 5 | Champhai | Farkawn | BP-26 | COB Farkawn/42 AR |

| 13 | Saiha | Phura | BP-18 | COB Tuipang/30 AR |


**iv). Land Acquisition for Indo_Bangladesh Fence & BOPs :**

**Fencing of the India-Bangladesh Border:**

 The construction of the India-Bangladesh border fence began in Mizoram in 2005. The total proposed length of the fence along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border is 344.41 kilometers, of which approximately 75% has been completed.

 The Mizoram State Boundary Committee has reported that, due to the negligence of the companies responsible for the construction, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram now fall on the Bangladeshi side of the border. Additionally, the committee discovered that the fencing bisects 20 other villages.

 Border fencing has yet to be initiated along a 60-kilometres section within the Dampa Tiger Reserve. This delay is due to pending approvals from the National Board of Wildlife, which requires the state to provide about 1,520 hectares of non-forest land as compensation before granting clearance.

**Border Roads**

Along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border, 303.97 kilometers of border patrol roads have been constructed out of an approved total length of approximately 602.28 kilometers.

**Border Outposts (BOPs)**

Of the 91 approved BSF Border Outposts (BOPs), construction has been completed for 18 BOPs. The remaining 73 BOPs are yet to be established along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border. Additionally, Mizoram Police have deployed security personnel from the Indian Reserve Battalion (IR Bn) along the Indo-Bangladesh border, particularly on the western side of Mamit District, Mizoram.

**v). Foreigners Identification Portal (FIP):**

The Foreigners Identification Portal (FIP) is designed for recording the personal and biometric information of foreign nationals residing illegally. Currently, access to FIP is limited to the District Deputy Commissioner in Mizoram, as the Police Department does not yet have access.

In a Council of Ministers meeting held on September 27, 2023, at 10:30 AM in the Chief Minister's Office Cabinet Room, the issue of documenting the biographic and biometric data of illegal migrants in Mizoram was addressed. It was concluded that, given the impending General Elections to the Mizoram State Assembly, the Government of Mizoram should not undertake the collection of such data. Therefore, the identification of foreigners residing illegally is not feasible at this time.

Consequently, the Commissioner &amp; Secretary to the Mizoram Government's Home Department was asked to guide the Police Department on using the Foreigners Identification Portal through letter No. MSB/VB-56/2024/4 dated March 18, 2024. A reply from the relevant authority is still awaited.

The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Foreigners Identification Portal, under the Foreigners Division, MHA, currently utilized by the Government of Mizoram, was created by NIC, MHA on February 2, 2024.

1. The FIP comprises six fields:

 1) Application Details (Mandatory)

 2) Address Details in Origin Country (Mandatory)

 3) Address Details in India (Mandatory)

 4) Identity Details (Mandatory)

 5) Occupation in Origin Country

 6) Occupation in India

2. The State Government has no objections, and the foreigners have no issues regarding the application details.

3. Foreigners, particularly displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh, do not possess e-mail IDs, which are mandatory for the Address Detail field.

4. In the mandatory Address Details in India section, State Government officials and displaced individuals from Myanmar and Bangladesh are unable to specify their Entry Dates into India accurately. These individuals often enter through multiple points and frequently travel back and forth due to circumstances in their home countries. Additionally, they cannot determine the required Area Code, which is also mandatory.

5. The section on the Agency or Individual responsible for sending individuals to India is irrelevant for displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh.

6. Regarding the mandatory Identity Details, displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh lack the necessary documents for uploading to the Portal. Additionally, there is difficulty in uploading the Myanmar embassy form, as the State Government does not have access to it.

7. There are no issues with the Occupation in Origin Country and Occupation in India fields, as these are not mandatory.

8. Due to strong ancestral ties with displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh, and considering the unstable political situations in Myanmar and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the State Government believes that deporting or pushing back these refugees should not be pursued until their safety and security can be assured. Consequently, the State Government suggests that the relevance of the Embassy Form be reconsidered by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

**Notes:**

1. The Embassy Form is to be reviewed by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). It will be communicated with the embassies of the concerned countries in India to confirm the nationality of the illegal migrants/displaced persons, facilitating the issuance of necessary travel documents for their immediate deportation.

2. Regarding the capture of biometric details of displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh under the NAFIS Portal, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) finalized necessary revisions to the portal to accommodate the specific needs of these displaced individuals on May 3, 2024.

****vi). Protected Area Regime in the State of Mizoram :****

**Protected Area Coverage in Mizoram:**

- According to Section 3 of the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, no foreign national is permitted to enter or remain in a protected area without obtaining a permit issued by the Central Government or an authorized officer.

- As outlined in Section 2(a) of the same order, a 'protected area' is defined as any border area that lies beyond the inner line, as detailed in Schedule I.

- Schedule I of the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, specifies that the inner line in Mizoram extends from the tri-junction of Manipur, Mizoram, and Assam, following the northern and western borders of Mizoram up to the international boundary.

**Current System for Issuing Protected Area Permits to Foreigners for Entry into Mizoram:**

- According to Section 3 of the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, "No foreigner shall enter or remain in any protected area except under and in accordance with a permit issued by the Central Government or any officer authorized by the Central Government."

- Previously, travel agents would apply on behalf of foreigners wishing to enter Mizoram. The Secretary of the Home Department was responsible for issuing these entry permits to foreigners. The entire process of application submission and permit issuance was conducted manually.

**Suspension of the Protected Area Permit (PAP):**

- The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, via Notification No. 25022/160/2010-F.I dated December 30, 2010, suspended the Protected Area Permit requirement from January 1, 2011, for a duration of one year.

- The suspension of PAP in Mizoram has been extended periodically by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The most recent extension was executed via Notification No. 25022/160/2010-F.I dated December 16, 2022, extending the suspension up to December 31, 2027.

**Withdrawal of Protected Area Suspension Order:**

- On December 17, 2024, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, issued an order (ref. No. 25022/160/2010-F.I (Part.I)(i) dated 17.12.2024) immediately canceling the Protected Area Permit (PAP) suspension. Consequently, the entire regions of Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland have been reinstated as protected areas under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, due to increased security concerns along their borders.

- Furthermore, the Ministry of Home Affairs has mandated that all PAP/RAP applications be processed exclusively through the e-FRRO Portal. No physical PAP/RAP permits will be issued under any circumstances as per the directive (Letter No. 25022/160/2010-F.I (Part.I)(ii) dated 17.12.2024).

**Current Status:**

- Mizoram falls under the jurisdiction of the Foreigner Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) in Kolkata, along with other northeastern states.

- The Senior Superintendent of Police, CID (SB), serves as the State Nodal Officer and the State Foreigner Registration Officer (FRO). Additionally, It act as the District FRO for Aizawl District.

- Each district's Superintendent of Police in Mizoram performs the role of District FRO for their respective districts.

- In line with the directive from the Ministry of Home Affairs requiring that all PAP/RAP applications be processed through the e-FRRO Portal, a training session on Immigration Visa Foreigner Registration Tracking (IVFRT), PAP, and RAP was held on January 10, 2025. This training was organized for the State FRO and all District FROs at the Cyber Forensic cum Training Centre, SP Office, Aizawl, Mizoram and was conducted by the Deputy Director of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), Mizoram.

**Procedure for Applying to Enter and Tracking Foreigners in e-FRRO:**

Any foreign national wishing to enter a Protected Area (such as Mizoram) must:

 a) Obtain a Protected Area Permit before coming to India by directly applying at the Indian Mission in their country.

b) Submit an online application through the e-FRRO portal (Immigration, Visa, Foreigner Registration &amp; Tracking) to enter the Protected Area after arriving in India.

The application will be reviewed by FRRO Kolkata, responsible for the North Eastern States. Once accepted, the application will be forwarded to the relevant FRO (District Superintendent of Police).

After examining the application, the designated FRO will provide an online recommendation to FRRO Kolkata, which will then email the approval letter to the applicant.

Upon entering the Protected Area, the foreigner must self-register on the portal within 24 hours from the time of entry.

If staying at a hotel, the hotel must complete the C-Form entry on the portal within 24 hours of the foreigner's check-in to assist the FRO in tracking the foreigner’s presence.

Since the online Protected Area Permit (PAP) system is still in its early stages, it is challenging to clearly understand the procedures and the time required for issuing PAPs. For example, a Japanese national, Tetsuo Yamaguchi, applied for a PAP on January 22, 2025, and his application was approved on January 23, 2025, valid from January 23 to January 29, 2025. In this instance, the Foreigners Registration Officer (FRO) in Mizoram was not directed to conduct the necessary verification, and the permit was issued directly by the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Kolkata.

**Manpower Situation:**

The Senior Superintendent of Police (Sr. SP) of CID (SB) is appointed as the State Foreigners Registration Officer. This unit, through the Foreigners Registration Branch, is responsible for executing the Immigration, Visa, Foreigners Registration &amp; Tracking (IVFRT) Project. This includes: i) the e-FRRO portal, ii) the District Police Module, iii) the Nationality Status Verification Portal, and iv) the C-Form/S-Form Portal. Additionally, this branch is managing the implementation of the Passport Seva Project Portal with only eight police personnel of various ranks. Given the severe manpower shortage described above, it is believed that additional staff will be necessary for the nodal unit, i.e., the FRO and Sr. SP, CID (SB), in due course to efficiently perform these functions.

**Actions Taken :**

1. On January 10, 2025, a hands-on training session on utilizing the online Protected Area Permit via the e-FRRO portal was held at the Cyber Forensic-cum-Training Centre in the SP, Aizawl Office. Attendees included representatives from the State Foreigners Registration Office (FRO), District FROs, and SP Security. The resource person for this training was Rochungnunga Hrangchal, Deputy Director of NIC and State Coordinator of IVFRT in Mizoram.

2. A meeting to address issues related to the Protected Area Permit (PAP) took place on January 27, 2025, at 11:00 AM in the office chamber of the Secretary, Home Department, Government of Mizoram. The attendees were:

 - Dingluaia, Deputy Inspector General, CID

 - Dr. Andrew H. Vanlaldika, Additional Secretary, Home Department

 - PC Lalduhthlanga, Joint Secretary (P), Home Department

 - Vanlalfaka Ralte, Senior Superintendent of Police, CID (SB)

 - Rochungnunga Hrangchal, Deputy Director (IT), NIC

 - C. Lalfakmawia, Officer on Special Duty and Under Secretary, Home Department

 - Lalnunmawii Varte, Additional Superintendent of Police, Security

**Penalty for not having PAP Permit :**
