****Brief Report of Breach of Security on 16.11.2018 @ 1:30 a.m. at****

****Chief Minister’s Bungalow Complex****

 On 16.11.2018 a report regarding breach of security at Chief Minister’s Bungalow on 16.11.2018 @ 1:30 a.m was received and the incident was duly enquired as under.

 On 16.11.2018, at around 1:30 a.m, while C/245 Zohmangaiha of 1st Bn. MAP was on duty at CM’s Bungalow Main Gate, 2 (two) unknown persons approached him by repeatedly chanting “Halleluia, Amen”. When he enquired the matter, they replied that God had sent them to the Chief Minister and they could not divulge their ‘message’ to none other than the Chief Minister (it is learnt that the Gate remained open at that time). While the sentry on duty was intending to inform other security duty personnel through inter-com, the two unknown persons proceeded towards CM’s Bungalow and one of them shouted in front of CM Office by saying, “Halleluia, Amen! I am Lalrempara Ralte, son of Lalengliana”.

 Subsequently, Lalrempara Ralte moved towards CM’s Bungalow and swayed the gate which CRPF personnel have manned. The gate was easily opened, but the sentry on duty somehow prevented them to enter inside. In the meantime, Security personnel (Night duty) came out from their barrack and pushed back the two unknown persons from the Bungalow complex, which was around 2:00 a.m. After which situation became normal without any untoward incident.

 From the light of enquiry, it can be adduced that the two persons were so-called ‘Hlimsang’ (claimed to be spiritually enlightened) persons and were not influenced by intoxication. The true identities of the two persons are:

 1. Lalrempara Ralte (30)

 S/o Lalengliana

 Bungkawn, CID Complex, Aizawl

 2. Saihmingliana Sailo (24)

 S/o Biakhluna Sailo

 Bungkawn, CID Complex, Aizawl

 Information has also been received that there was an incident of breach of security in the month of October in which, one Zion Lalremruata, Gen. Secretary, All Mizoram Farmers’ Union, under the influence of alcohol, had entered CM’s Bungalow.

 Enquiry found that the incidents happened due to the negligence on the part of Security personnel deployed at Chief Minister’s Office which also indicated dereliction of duties as the aforesaid persons could easily sneaked into the premises of CM’s Bungalow without hindrance.
