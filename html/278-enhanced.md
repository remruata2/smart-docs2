Subject: Security threat assessment report

Ref: No. MSB/CB/B-19(A)/579 Dated Aizawl, the 15th Sept., 2016

Sir,

 With reference to the above cited letter number, a comprehensive security threat assessment was conducted by self as directed and the report of which is as indicated below-

 It may be recollected that as a result of certain imbroglio arose between one Prof. J.V. Hluna, President of BJP, Mizoram and two major Students’ Unions of Mizoram viz the MZP and the MSU who had recently burnt down the effigy of the mentioned individual on 18th August, 2016 followed by a continued denunciation through social media by jointly issuing a press release in which they expressed their discontentment towards him, a request to provide security personal/personnel was submitted by the said individual in which he claimed himself to have been disturbed and intimidated by the said two students’ unions and also that he once had experienced a serious disturbance recently where his guests’/visitors’ vehicles were seriously damaged during night time by unidentified miscreants who are supposedly members of the two students’ associations. Prof. J.V Hluna further explained that due to the mentioned incidents as well as other circumstances, his relatives were afraid for his personal safety and also that his wife and children were deeply feel unsafe and insecure even inside their residence.

 Owing to the above reported threat it was understood that certain undying enmity from the Students Unions’ side is still existed though serious physical detriment has not been occurred till date. Moreover, he (Prof. J.V. Hluna), being the President of one major political party in the state, it is highly opinioned that actual physical harm is much possible towards the same as a result of various threat and intimidation from any opposing party. On the other hand, the present threat which he reported was arise from the two major Students’ Unions of the state whose members are generally a youngsters having vindictive, uncompromising and relentless characters when manipulated, stirred or excited.

 I, after carefully assessing the above mentioned circumstances and beyond, concluded that Prof. J.V. Hluna’s request to provide PSO/PSOs is genuinely befitting and plausible. Therefore, in view of his present situation, at the least, provision of one personal security guard is highly recommended for his personal safety and his family as well.

  Yours faithfully,
