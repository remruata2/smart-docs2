<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Drug trafficking is an illicit trade involving the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale of substances which are subject to&nbsp;drug prohibition&nbsp;laws. </span></span></span><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Proximity of the Indo-Myanmar border to the &lsquo;Golden Triangle&rsquo;, growing demand for drugs among the local population in the North Eastern states, political instability and insecurity brought about by numerous insurgencies in the region as well as a porous and poorly guarded border provided a proliferating environment for traffickers to smuggle heroin and psychotropic substances into the country through the Indo-Myanmar border<span style="background-color:white">. Heroin and other illegal drugs are trafficked into India across the border into the states of Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram.Particularly for Mizoram,</span> which shares a 496.531 kms long international border with Myanmar,<span style="background-color:white"> drug trafficking across the border occurs with ease</span>. Because of close cross-border cultural ties, both governments have agreed a 16-km free movement zone around the border for the tribal groups divided between the two countries. The border is virtually open, with just one operational checkpoint, and many tribal groups are divided between the two countries. Myanmar is the world&rsquo;s second-largest producer of opium, and thus Mizoram is today the first stop on the flow of heroin out of the region. While drugs have seeped through the unfenced border for many years, trafficking of heroinand methamphetamine has seen a steep rise in recent years. Drug trafficking in Mizoram mainly features the following dimensions:</span></span></span></span></p>

</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Major drugs which are commonly trafficked in Mizoram are heroin, opium, ganja, methamphetamine, ephedrine, Nitrazepam, Diazepam, Alprazolam and various cough syrup. The state government is taking massive effort to curb the menace of drug trafficking and prosecute the drug traffickers. Mizoram Police and the state Excise and Narcotics Department have had tremendous success in tackling the drug problem. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">CHALLENGES :</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The major challenges faced by local law enforcement agencies, particularly the Mizoram Police in tackling trafficking of drugs/psychotropic substances are as follows :</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The border with Myanmar is very porous. Although checking of vehicles for drugs and other contraband items is done at Police Check Gate at Zokhawthar (main entry point from Myanmar into Mizoram, India), smugglers/traffickers find alternate routes into Mizoram, crossing the river Tiau at various points along the 496.531 kms long international border with Myanmar. Lack of sufficient manpower at Zokhawthar Police Station is preventing the Mizoram Police to dominate the border and successfully prevent cross border trafficking of drugs. The same may be said for Vairengte Police Check Gate where drugs are smuggled in from Assam, mostly in load carrying vehicles.&nbsp; Insufficient staff and heavy flow of traffic in and out of Mizoram through Vairengte have made it difficult to thoroughly check all vehicles coming into Mizoram from Assam for illegal drugs. </span></span></span></span></li>

Construction of means of transportation and communication is difficult in such a terrain, and as a result, the border area remains sparsely populated with depressed economic development. Absence of roads, communication links and other border guarding infrastructure also adversely affect Policing as they hamper the easy and rapid movement of the border guarding forces along the border.</span></span></span></span></li>

While the FMR has helped the tribes continue maintain their age old ties, it has also become a cause of concern for the security as its provisions are exploited by drug smugglers and traffickers to cross over to India (Mizoram) unrestricted. &nbsp;Another provision in the FMR, which allows tribal people to carry head load has also been misused to smuggle in drugs, weapons and other contraband items. These head loads are seldom checked by the security forces. </span></span></span></span></li>

Lack of practical training and experience of Investigating Officers in investigation of drug related cases under ND&amp;PS Act have resulted in acquittals merely on technical grounds.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></li>

Mizoram has registered a high percentage of drug abusers among its 10 lakhs or so population, and is one of the highest in the whole country.

The YMA is organised at the State level (Central YMA) as well as the local level (Branch) with different other layers of organisation in between. The various branches of the YMA organised at the local level are instrumental in the fight against drug trafficking as they can provide in-depth knowledge of the terrain of their respective areas, hence possible drug trade routes can be determined, sufficient manpower to augment the Police in checking of vehicles and people and are a reliable source of intelligence regarding any suspected drug traders or any active drug trade in their areas. Hence, special drive may be conducted regularly with the YMA or any other similar social organisation.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Special Narcotics Police Station under CID (Crime), Mizoram has been established solely for the purpose of combating drug trafficking. The most effective means in combating drug trafficking is collection of intelligence by cultivating and engaging informants which often requires huge sums of money to earn their trust and loyalty and to carry out special operations. Also, effective means of transportation and communication as well as the latest hi-tech surveillance equipments and tactical gears are all necessary for the Police to conduct successful operations against drug traffickers. Hence, it is of paramount importance, more than anything, to strengthen the Mizoram Police with sufficient manpower, funds and resources. </span></span></span></span></p>
