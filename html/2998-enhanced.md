No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/303

Dated: 7th May, 2019.

Around 35 employees of ICFAI University Mizoram gathered outside the main gate of the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) near Mizo High School Field, Zarkawt this morning, i.e. 07.05.2019 @ 7:00 a.m. They assembled to await the outcome of the Cabinet meeting held this morning at the CMO as they believed that the Cabinet meeting would be discussing about issue on ICFAI University and the demand made by its employees and also their belief that the Government will be sanctioning Rs 2.5 Crore for addressing the problems of ICFAI Society, Hyderabad, which they considered was too little. After the meeting, Pu Lalruatkima and Pu Lalchhandama Ralte, Hon’ble Ministers of State informed the gathering that the Government will form a Study Group headed by the Chief Secretary and consisting of representatives of State Government, representatives of ICFAI University General Headquarters and representatives of teaching and non-teaching staffs of ICFAI University Mizoram. They also informed the gathering that the Government had no intention of granting Rs. 2.5 Crore to aid ICFAI University.

 Information has also been received that Pu J.P.Rammapa, ICFAI Chancellor accompanied by Pu C.Dothanga, IPS(rtd), newly appointed Adviser, ICFAI Society headed for ICFAI campus, Durtlang to have a meeting with Employees’ Forum and Students Action Committee @ 11:00 a.m. This visit was taken as an opportunity by employees and students to express their grievances by carrying placards and ‘puandum( traditional black attire)’ while receiving him. The Chancellor returned without alighting the vehicle on seeing the reception. The demonstrators felt aggrieved by the action of the Chancellor and had been deciding on their next course of action.

 Later @ 4:00 p.m., 37 strong ICFAI Students Action Committee met the Chancellor at Aijal Club to represent their grievances and ask him to sign a memorandum. However, they failed to convince the Chancellor to give his signature and left @ 4:40 p.m. They are likely to have a meeting tomorrow, i.e. 08.05.2019, exact time to be decided later, at ICFAI campus, Durtlang North in which they had invited MZP and MSU to attend. Information indicated that the Students are likely to turn the issue as a discrimination against the Mizos as a minority.
