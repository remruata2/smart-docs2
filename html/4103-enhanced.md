These attacks, which involved looting cash and kidnapping a bank manager, significantly disrupted the local banking system, leaving communities with restricted access to essential services and financial transactions. The robberies also sparked fear, causing many locals to flee the area and further destabilizing daily life for residents.

 Following the recent government change in Bangladesh, there have been no new reported activities by KCNA, and authorities have not released any arrested KCNA members. Security forces remain vigilant in both Bangladesh and Mizoram, monitoring potential cross-border militant movements.

1. **Impact of Chin State & CHT Dynamic on Mizoram****:**

 On 18.09.2024, a Bengali man named Mohamed Mamun, who was suspected of theft was lynched to death in Khagrachhari District of Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh by a mob consisting of Chakma and Marma communities. The situation escalated leading to violent clashes between the Bengali settlers and the minority community in the CHT which reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least three people and destruction of numerous homes of the Chakma community. Acknowledging the reported atrocities of the indigenous Chakmas in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the Chakma community of Mizoram under the aegis of Central Young Chakma Association along with all the civil society organizations of the Chakma community organized a protest rally at Kamalanagar, Mizoram on 22.09.2024 followed by a candle lighting rally on the same night. The protest rally was participated by almost 2500 protesters who demanded the intervention of the Indian Government in the reported atrocities against the indigenous Chakma community of Bangladesh.

 The border guarding forces as well as the State Police were alerted to check any possible influx of the Chakma community of Bangladesh who had fled their homes. However, there is no report of any illegal entry of the Chakma community from Bangladesh into Mizoram, India due to the incident.

The increase in influx of Myanmar refugees into Mizoram had impacted the economy of Mizoram in many ways. The number of seizure of Narcotic drugs increases many fold after the military coup and the subsequent fight between the SAC and the resistance forces. Smugglers are recently using foreign packed food items like fruit juices etc for concealment of illegal Narcotics Substances.
