Sir,

 With reference to your letter No. CB/PHQ/Meeting-NE/06/198 dt.10.5.2010 and subject cited above, the require information on point (i), (iii), (iv) &amp; (vii) are as follows :-

**1.** **Point No.(i):**

 Mizoram is often boasted as the most peaceful state in India and also termed as an island of peace mainly due to the absence of insurgent outfit in Mizoram. However, this does not necessarily meant that Mizoram is free of any insurgent and militant activities. In fact the Mizoram Police are giving the price of keeping Mizoram a peaceful state during the last many years and were effectively dealing with militant outfit operating from the neighbouring states. Following are some of them:-

** 1) **HPC (D**): The Hmar Peoples Convention (Democrat) a militant having base in Manipur and Cachar bordering the northern part of Mizoram revived their activities during the last part of 2009 in the form of collecting the so-called annual taxes at the rate of Rs.100/- per household and Rs.200/- each for Govt. servants inside their demand area falling under Mizoram state. Some of the village councils had submitted the demanded money under duress. Such activities of the HPC(D) militant is a serious concern for the Govt. of Mizoram as it posed threat to the peaceful situation of Mizoram particularly in the northern border areas.**

 On 2.9.2008, HPC(D) militant outfit ambushed ist IR Bn. pay escort party at the outskirt of Saipum village. SI Lalrindika and 3(three) Constables were killed at the spot.

 2) **BRU/BRA**: A certain Bru armed group of protagonist as a Bru Revolutionary Union/Army brutally murdered Zarzokima of Bungthuam village of Mizoram on 13.11.2009 which resulted communal clash between Mizo and Bru of the areas. Most of the member of the armed group suspected of involving in the said murder have been arrested whereas the king pin leader was brutally murdered by the other faction of Bru armed militant sometimes back. These Bru armed group always pose threat to the area bordering Mizoram - Tripura and Mizoram - Hailakandi District of Assam.

 3) **ZRA**: The Zomi Revolutionary Army, a militant outfit of Paite community having base in Manipur is not having activities inside Mizoram bordering Manipur during the last few years.

 4) **HNA**: The Hmar National Army, another militant outfit of Hmar community having base in Manipur is also having no activities inside Mizoram.

** **Arms Trafficking:** Besides causing subversive activities and law and order problems in Mizoram, there have often been a report of the militant outfit, taking advantage of its peaceful situation, using Mizoram as a route for transhipment of their Arms procured from South East Asia. The relentless and dedicated effort of the Mizoram Police have checked the smooth flow of arms trafficking through Mizoram during the last few years.**

Amongst the capture of arms &amp; ammns. only the following may be highlighted:

a) On 2.2.07, 1(one) 9mm Pistol Colt USA MOD 5.6 alongwith 4 rds. of ammns. was recovered from Chandmary.

b) On 25.6.08, 19(nineteen) nos. of AK-47 Rifles was seized by Mizoram Police near Buichali. The arms&amp;ammns were to be delivered to DHD(Nunsia faction).

c) On 21.4.08, 1(one) UZI and 5 live ammns. was seized by Mizoram Police from Champhai.

d) On 5.7.08, 7(seven) nos. of AK-47 was seized by Mizoram Police at Vairengte check gate.

 5) Spare Batteries - 12 nos.

 6) Walkie-Talkie charger - 12 nos.

 7) Extendable Antennae of Walkie Talkie - 5 nos.

  Huge expenditure have been spent in dealing with the militant and arms trafficking either in hard cash or in terms of POL or TA/DA of the staff involved and other logistic support. The amount of which was immeasurable.

  With a view to take effective measures in curbing the militant activities and arms trafficking through Mizoram, the following steps may be taken by the concern States.

1. Joint Intelligent Meeting of the concern States may be held at regular interval for sharing of intelligence concerning the two neighbouring States pertaining to the movements/activities of armed militants, drug traffickers and other undesirable elements.

2. Joint operation to deal with militancy may be held in the area infested by insurgent outfit at regular interval or whenever the need arise out of the activities of the militants operating in that area.

 2) NSCN(I/M) - 2 on 11.2.2009

 1 on 23.1.2010

 4 on 12.5.2010

**2.** **Point No.(iii):**

 Inspite of its successful dealing with the militancy during the last many years, the Govt. of Mizoram is not covered by the Surrendered-cum-Rehabilitation Scheme instituted by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India as a result of which no proper rehabilitation and other relief matters could not be provided to the militant who had surrendered to the Govt. of Mizoram. However, in the absence of the said scheme, the following militant outfits surrendered to Mizoram Government and rehabilitated as under:

 **Name of outfit** **No. of person surrendered Amount Given**

 1) SPLA 70(69 on 17.7.2009, 1 on 26.6.2010) Rs.3000/- each as

 Cash Assistance

 2) BLFM 804 on 26.10.2006 Rs.50,000/- as

 Cash Assistance

  Rs.30,000/- as

 Housing Assistance

   4 on 6.7.2006 Rs.3000/- as

 11 on 12.8.2006 Housing Assistance

 38 on 16.3.2006 Rs.20,000/- as

 Cash Assistance

 Rs.2000/- as

 Transportation Charges

**3.** **Point No.(iv):**

 This is not relevant to Mizoram since the SRE Scheme do not cover the State. Mizoram could have played a very valuable supporting role to its neighbouring states having militancy problems had it enjoyed Security Related Expenditure.

**4.** **Point No.(vii):**

** 1) _Co-ordination in counter insurgency operation etc among various states_: More co-ordination among the N.E States in matter relating to counter insurgency operation, fight against arms, narcotic drugs and counterfeit currency smugglings is the need of the hour as combing operations in one state often resulted in insurgents and smugglers crossing the inter-state border.**

 2) _Establishment/functioning of Joint Interrogation Centre_: JICs should be established in all N.E States for unifying the efforts of various states and agencies in the fight against insurgency and other criminal activities.

** 3)_Exchange of personal particulars/ photographs etc of insurgents/ smugglers crossing the Indo-Bangla and Indo-Myanmar border_: This would undoubtedly help the concern state Police for effecting arrests of insurgents/smugglers frequently crossing the Indo-Bangla and Indo-Myanmar borders.**

 4) _Functioning of SMAC_: Establishment of SMAC in various states should be accelerated and made functional at the earliest.

Yours faithfully,

****(C. LALDINA)****
