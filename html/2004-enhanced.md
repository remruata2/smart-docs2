****INTERROGATION STATEMENT OF GENIOUS CHAKMA****

**I joined JSS after I was convinced by the leaders of the outfit that Bangladesh Government failed to honour the peace accord. Hence I joined the movement to pressurize the Bangladesh Government to fulfill its promises.**

**I was arrested by BSF party at Chhotapursury (near Barapansury) Mizoram, India on 18.7.09 who seized my weapons, cash and other personal items. Then, on 19.7.09 we were handed over to the Mizoram police OP at Barapansury. It was never our intention to create any law and order disturbance in Indian territory.**
