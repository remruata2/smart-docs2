Subject: Lok Sabha Starred Question Dy. No. 9465.

Sir,

 With reference to your letter No.CB/PHQ/LSQ/13/303 dt. 22.12.2014, I am furnishing the required information as under:

 Relating to Inter-State border dispute, Mizoram state has so far faced such situation. The Mizoram-Assam border tension had flared up in the month of February 2014 after Assam Police and Forest Department personnel allegedly dismantled the farm house of Mizo farmers near Buhchangphai village in Mizoram. In fact, Mizoram does not accept the boundary demarcation as pronounced in the Inner Line notification of 1930 and 1933, a boundary which was imposed on the people of Mizoram, when the erstwhile Lushai Hills District was administered by the Govt. of Assam with scrant regards for historical truth and sentiment of the people.

 Multiple numbers of demonstrations and agitations were held by various NGOs and student bodies in Mizoram in demand of the settlement of the Mizoram-Assam border dispute.

 On June 2014, Shri LalThanhawla, Hon'ble Chief Minister of Mizoram met Shri Rajnath Singh, Hon'ble Union Home Minister and requested him to ensure early settlement of the Mizoram-Assam boundary dispute.

Yours faithfully,

(GOVERDONA SAILO) Dy.SP
