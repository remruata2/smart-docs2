**2. (iii) Conflict between Myanmar Army and PDF (People's Defence Forces);its impact in Mizoram :**

 Mizoram shares 496.53 Kilometres of unfenced international border with Myanmar while the Free Movement Regime (FMR) allows people along the border of the adjoining countries to enter 16 Kilometres into the neighbouring country without a Visa.

 The military coup of 1st February 2021 in Myanmar and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) resulted in the influxes of considerable number of Myanmar nationals in general and Chin community in particular seeking asylum and taking shelter in Mizoram. However, not all these refugees continued staying in Mizoram as some of them had returned to their home country, Myanmar.

 The number of Myanmarese nationals taking refuge in Mizoram are as follows : (as on 19.03.2024)

DRUGS AND ILLEGAL TRADE :

 As mentioned earlier, Mizoram shares an unfenced porous international border with Myanmar which is often taken advantage by drug smugglers and illegal traders. Due to the long stretch border and porosity in the absence of physical barrier combined with Free Movement Regime, people across the border can move freely cross the border at many locations resulting in an easy route for smugglers. The increase in the illegal trafficking of narcotic drugs in the recent time can be attributed due to the ethnic clash in Manipur which did not allows trafficking these contraband items through the state and increasing demand of fund by many ethnic armed groups of Myanmar who are fighting the State Administrative Council to overthrow the Myanmar Army from the current political administration.

ISSUE OF UNIFORM PERSONNEL OF MYANMAR SURRENDERING TO MIZORAM POLICE AND ASSAM RIFLES:

 Due to the recent intense military operations conducted by the combined resistance forces of Myanmar against Myanmar Army in several places of Chin State, Myanmar, many Myanmar Army and Police personnel posted and camped near the IMB surrendered themselves to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles at different places. These personnel of Myanmar were evacuated to safety for their return into Myanmar. The lack of proper Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on the issue of surrendering of Myanmar Army personnel or government servant needed a review to devise a strategy on the matter.

 The issue of foreign National Army entering our state/country with arms and ammunitions in large numbers is a threat to the internal security of the state as well as the country. The entry of such unauthorised entry of armed foreign Army personnel post a high risk to the population especially the residents along the indo (Mizoram) Myanmar border areas.

**2.(v) Updates on KNO and Bawn community issue in Mizoram**
