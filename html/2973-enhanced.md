 Information received indicated that Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Forum (MBDPF) held an Executive Meeting today, i.e. 14.3.2019 @ 11:00 a.m at their office at Naisingpara Transit Camp, Tripura. The meeting was presided over by Pu A. Sawibunga, President and attended by 12 (twelve) members.

 The meeting discussed about the resolution of NGOCC meeting held yesterday, i.e. 13.3.2019 which demanded that Brus in Tripura Transit Camps should cast their votes in their respective Polling Stations in the upcoming MP (Lok Sabha) Election, 2019. The MBDPF meeting felt they are unable to implement the demand of the NGOCC by their own expenses unless the Government pay all the necessary expenditure for their transportation, fooding and lodging, etc. The meeting further resolved to submit an application, at the earliest, to the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the Chief Electoral Officer, Mizoram with a prayer to arrange Special Polling Booths in all the 6 (six) Refugees Camps in Tripura in order to enable Bru voters in the Camps to cast their votes in the upcoming Election.
