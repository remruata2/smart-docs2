****THREAT PERCEPTION ASSESSMENT REPORT****

****Discreet enquiry was conducted to assess threat perceived in respect Pu K. Zoramthanga, Tachhip who is also a member of PAMRA and the report of which is as under :****

****

**Pu K. Zoramthanga was a member of the banned outfit MNF/MNA during the Mizoram insurgency and Aizawl Town Duty. He, along with S/S Capt. Lalhleia, were suspected to be involved in the assassination of the IGP GS. Arya in 1975.**

****

**In retaliation of the killing of S/S Capt. Lalhleia in 1975, members of the Aizawl Town duty killed Pu Mangchhuana, whom they thought to be the person responsible for the death of S/S Capt. Lalhleia.**

**During the month of February-March 2022, around 20(Twenty) members of the relatives of Pu Mangchhuana (L), headed by Pi Nubawihi, sister of the wife of Pu Manchhuana (L), Pi Nubuangi (L), living at Luangmual, Aizawl, went to the house of Pu Chalthanzuala s/o Ch. Chhunga, Luangmual, demanding that Pu K. Zoramthanga should not frequently visit their house as they considered him to be responsible for the death of Pu Mangchhuana, and seeing him at their locality hurts their sentiments. It may be noted here that Pu. K. Zoramthanga was not present at the residence of Pu Chalthanzuala during the incident.**

**Pu. K. Zoramthanga was also approached personally and he denied having any involvement for the death of Pu Mangchhuana and also stated that he was not present at Aizawl during his (Pu Mangchhuana ) assassination. PAMRA Gen. Hqrs., Aizawl, took up the case and even approached Branch YMA, Luangmual, to express their dismay on such incident.**

**Ever since from the above mentioned incident, Pu K. Zoramthanga had not received any further threat from the relatives of Pu Mangchhuana (L) and hence, it may be concluded that the threat perceived in respect of Pu K. Zoramthanga is minimal and provisions of PSO may not be required at the moment.**
