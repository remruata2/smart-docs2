****Treat perception Assessment****

There was a vehicular collision between a Hyundai Getz car driven by Gideon Lalnunthara of Bawngkawn and a scooty driven by Joshua Lalthangzauva of Dawrpui on the night of 2/6/2019 at Thuampui, Opposite Nexa Car Showroom. As a result of this mishap, the scooty rider lost his life and Bawngkawn Police Station C/No. 138/2019 dt.4.6.2019 U/S 279/304 ‘A’ IPC r/w 181/185 MV Act was duly registered. The accused, Gideon Lalnunthara Fanai was arrested and released on bail.

 What enraged the relatives and friends of the deceased scooty rider is that, they believed that after the incident, the car driver, Gideon Lalnunthara had dragged the body of Joshua Lalthangzauva to a distance of around 7 feets before stopping. Further, instead of taking care of the injured victim, the accused absconded immediately from the place of occurrence.

 During the course of inquiry, it was ascertained that on 29/07/2019 while Gideon Lalnunthara was at Millenium Centre, some friends of Joshua Lalnunthara gathered around the shop which resulted the intervention of Police personnel to escort him for safety.

_Conclusion_: As the relatives of the deceased expressed that they have placed the matter in the hands of their Lawyer and Police as there is an ongoing Police investigation in the issue, it is highly expected that both sides could find an amiable solution if they can organize a peaceful dialogue in the presence of a magistrate/Police. As for provision of security, it may be deemed unnecessary at the moment.
