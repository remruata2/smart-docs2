****CTU, CHAMPHAI Vrs JOINT NGO, ZOKHAWTHAR****

The main reason behind the present confrontation between Champhai Border Trade Transport Union (CTU) and Zokhawthar Joint NGO involves two points :

1. SENIORITY: Goods coming from Myanmar are stock in a transit points in Zokhawthar Town before they are transported to various destination inside India. These Goods are carried inside Indian Territorry using all sorts of transport vehicles, which were supposes to be done on seniority basis, i.e., vehicles arriving first should be allotted first the goods to be carried. However, CTU alleged that the supervising authority – Zokhawthar joint NGO practice nepotism as some of the owners of these vehicles belong to Zokhawthar town.

1. RATE OF COLLECTING DONATION: For transportation of these goods, Zokhawthar Joint NGO collected donation from each vehicles depending on the type of the commercial vehicles. These rates, according to CTU are far too high and must be reduced if not completely stopped.
