****NOTES ON AGENDA POINTS UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF UNION HOME SECRETARY TO BE HELD ON 16.07.2025 @ 5:00 PM****

1. **Suspension of FMR and Border Fencing in Mizoram**

1. **History of FMR –**

The Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that allowed citizens of both countries to travel freely within a 16 km radius of the international border without the need for a visa, with a stay limit of up to 72 hours. This regime was formalized as part of India's Act East Policy, aiming to preserve traditional ties and facilitate local trade, particularly for tribal communities residing along the border.

Historically, the FMR is rooted in the colonial-era division of communities, particularly the Zo ethnic groups (including Mizos, Chins, and Kukis), who were separated by the India-Myanmar border established during British rule. The regime spans a 1,629.5 km unfenced border shared between four Indian states—Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram—and Myanmar.

Initially, the FMR allowed unrestricted movement within the designated 16 km radius without specific entry-exit points. However, due to rising security concerns, including drug and arms trafficking, India introduced a permit system in 1968. Later, in 2004, India limited the travel distance to 16 km and designated specific crossing points.

A significant development occurred in 2018 when India and Myanmar signed the Land Border Crossing Agreement, which required border passes for residents within 16 km, with a 14-day stay limit. This marked a shift toward regulated movement, while still aiming to facilitate local trade and cultural interactions.

The Union Cabinet approved a Memorandum of Understanding in January 2018 to enhance economic interactions through the FMR framework. The regime's primary objective is to alleviate insecurity and maintain cultural and economic interactions between communities living along the border.

However, the FMR has been criticized for its misuse by insurgents and criminals. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), militants and criminals have exploited the regime to smuggle weapons, narcotics, and counterfeit currency, taking advantage of the leniencies to cross borders and evade capture. This misuse, particularly in the context of ongoing ethnic conflicts and civil unrest in Myanmar, led to increased security concerns, prompting the Indian government to announce on February 8, 2024, that it would scrap the FMR and fence the entire India-Myanmar border to ensure internal security and maintain the demographic structure of India's northeastern states.

Despite this announcement, as of December 2024, the FMR has not been formally scrapped, and new regulations have been introduced to tighten the movement regime, reflecting the ongoing tension between security imperatives and local needs.

1. **Evolution of Entry-Exit Points–**

In 2025, following the decision to suspend the FMR, the Indian government revised and expanded the list of entry-exit points along the Mizoram-Myanmar border to enforce tighter controls. Phase-I of these entry-exit points began operations on January 23, 2025, with initial points such as Zochachhuah, Hruitezawl, and Laitlang in Lawngtlai District. However, all entry-exit points were subsequently revised and proposed as follows, effective under the new regulations:

1) Zokhawthar (Champhai District)

 2) Hnahlan (Champhai District)

3) Zochachhuah (Lawngtlai District)

 4) Hrianghmun-Tuisa River (Saitual District)

 5) Vaphai (Champhai District)

 6) Farkawn (Champhai District)

 7) Thingsai (Hnahthial District)

 8) Lobo (Lungbun) (Siaha District)

 9) Chapi (Sapi) (Siaha District)

 10)Lopu (Lungpuk) (Siaha District)

 11)Rd-Saikul R Jn (Lawngtlai District)

 12) Lomasu (Lawngtlai District)

 13) Zote (Champhai District)

Sl 1-3 is in operation and sl. 4-13 is currently under proposed by Assam Rifles.

These revised entry-exit points are part of the new framework where movement is restricted to a 10 km radius from the border, and residents must obtain a border pass for visits up to seven days. The border pass, valid for one year, is issued by the Assam Rifles based on proof of identity, such as a certificate from the local police or village authority, confirming residency within the 10 km zone. This shift marks a significant evolution from the earlier unrestricted FMR to a more controlled and documented system, with crossing hours typically set from Monday to Saturday, 6 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., and minors accompanied by parents (with a maximum of three children per pass, additional passes required for more than three children).

| Zochachhhuah | 299 | 79 | 127 |


1. **Suspension of FMR and Border Fencing and Protests –**

_a) Brief History_

Mizoram shares a 510 km unfenced and porous border with Myanmar, with six districts—Champhai, Siaha, Lawngtlai, Hnahthial, Saitual, and Serchhip—adjacent to the international border. The FMR was intended to maintain traditional ties and alleviate insecurity for tribal communities, but its misuse for smuggling and insurgency led to the Indian government's decision on February 8, 2024, to scrap the FMR and fence the entire border. This decision was driven by internal security concerns, including the ongoing ethnic conflict in Manipur and civil unrest in Myanmar, with the government aiming to prevent illegal immigration and maintain demographic integrity.

The Zo ethnic communities, including Mizos, Chins, and Kukis, who were historically divided by the colonial-era border, have been particularly affected. The Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution on February 28, 2024, opposing the border fencing and FMR suspension, arguing that these measures would disrupt the livelihoods, social connections, and cultural fabric of the border communities. The resolution, introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, urged the central government to reconsider its decision, emphasizing the need to preserve the unity of the Zo ethnic people.

_b)FMR New Guidelines_

On December 24, 2024, the MHA issued revised guidelines for the FMR, reducing the free movement limit from 16 km to 10 km on either side of the international border. These regulations, effective from December 30, 2024, mandate the issuance of a Border Pass for residents within the 10 km zone, permitting a stay of up to seven days. The Border Pass issuance process involves filling a form, document inspection by the Assam Rifles, security and health checks by state police and health departments, biometrics recording, and issuance of a QR code-enabled pass.

_Key details of the new guidelines include:_

-Exemption under G.S.R. No. 1265: Members of hill tribes, whether Indian or Myanmarese, residing in border areas are exempted from the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950, subject to specified conditions.

- Meeting chaired by Secretary (BM), MHA**: On December 16, 2024, state governments were informed of the decision to regulate FMR through Border Passes, with criteria including proof of identity (POI) and passport details confirming residency within the 10 km zone.

These changes were part of a broader effort to address security concerns while attempting to balance local needs, but they have been met with resistance from border communities.

_c) Protests Against FMR Suspension and Border Fencing_

The decision to suspend the FMR and fence the border has sparked significant protests in Mizoram, reflecting the community's strong opposition to measures that they perceive as dividing their ethnic and cultural ties. The Zo Reunification Organisation (ZORO) has been at the forefront of these protests, organizing peaceful rallies to oppose the border fencing and FMR suspension.

- In May 2024, ZORO organized peaceful protest rallies at Vaphai and Zokhawthar, both in Champhai District, on May 16, 2024. The rally in Vaphai had approximately 280 participants, while the Zokhawthar rally saw around 1,000 participants, both ending peacefully. These rallies aimed to reunify the Chin-Kuki-Mizo-Zomi tribes and protest the government's decision to fence the border and cancel the FMR.

- Further protests occurred on January 29, 2025, when ZORO staged symbolic protests across various locations in Mizoram, including Aizawl, Mimbung (Saitual District), Lunglei, Serchhip, and Champhai. Around 150 participants across these locations burnt government orders related to the new FMR restrictions and guidelines, condemning the tightened movement regulations and proposed border fencing. All these protests ended peacefully, reflecting the community's commitment to non-violent resistance.

Additionally, the Mizoram Assembly's resolution in February 2024 and statements from civil society organizations like the Young Mizo Association (YMA) have underscored the opposition, with memoranda submitted to Union Home Minister Amit Shah in March 2025 urging reconsideration of the decision. These protests highlight the tension between national security imperatives and the cultural and economic needs of border communities, with ongoing debates about the impact on indigenous rights and cross-border relationships.

_Conclusion_

The suspension of the FMR and the proposal to fence the India-Myanmar border in Mizoram reflect a complex interplay of security, cultural, and economic factors. While the central government aims to address smuggling and insurgency, local communities and state authorities oppose these measures, citing their detrimental effects on traditional ties and livelihoods. The evolution of entry-exit points and new border pass systems represent efforts to regulate movement, but protests by groups like ZORO and resolutions by the Mizoram Assembly underscore the ongoing controversy, with no resolution in sight as of July 9, 2025.

1. **Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing**

The Indo-Bangladesh border, spanning approximately 4,096 kilometers, is one of the longest international boundaries globally. To enhance security and regulate migration, a comprehensive fencing project has been undertaken along this extensive border. Significant progress has been made, with over 90% of the fencing installation completed.

_Key Features of the Fencing Infrastructure :_

- _Primary Material :_ Barbed wire

- _Additional Features :_ Floodlights and advanced surveillance systems

- _Purpose :_ Effective border management and monitoring

High-priority areas prone to illegal crossings have been addressed, although some sections remain incomplete or require maintenance due to challenging terrain.

1. **Illegal influx in Mizoram :**

_Myanmar Refugees:_

The Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and ethnic armed groups in Chin State, Myanmar, have been actively opposing the military regime that seized power on February 1, 2021. This ongoing conflict has caused significant displacement of civilians, particularly from the Chin community, many of whom have sought refuge in Mizoram, India. Since the coup, there have been eight major waves of Myanmar nationals entering Mizoram.

From July 2, 2025, to the present, clashes between the Chin National Defence Force (CNDF), under the Chin National Organisation (CNO), and other forces have driven an additional 4,244 refugees into Mizoram, on top of those who arrived between 2021 and 2024.

_Bangladesh Refugees:_

On November 15, 2022, the Bangladesh Army launched a military operation against the Kuki-Chin National Army (KNA) in Chhaihkhiang Village, Bangladesh. This operation triggered a large-scale exodus of civilians, primarily from the Bawm community. In the initial wave, 272 civilians, including women and children, fled their villages and sought refuge in Mizoram, India.

Subsequent military operations have led to additional waves of Bawm civilians entering Mizoram’s Lawngtlai District.

**Biometric Enrollment Initiative for Myanmar Refugees in Mizoram :**

The Mizoram government is set to launch a comprehensive biometric enrollment initiative for over 32,000 Myanmar refugees residing across all 11 districts of the state. The process is scheduled to begin this month and aims to facilitate identification purposes only, without any intention of deportation.

The initiative will utilize the Foreigner Identification Portal, a digital platform developed by the National Informatics Centre. To ensure a seamless enrollment process, officials have recently undergone training and will be equipped with necessary technology, including computers, webcams, and other requisite materials.

The biometric enrollment initiative is a significant step towards documenting and identifying the refugee population in Mizoram, and it is expected to enhance the state's ability to manage and support this vulnerable group.
