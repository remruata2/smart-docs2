In this connection, Cachar Drivers’ Association conveyed their desire to have a meeting with leaders of MOTDA today i.e., 25.9.2020 @ 11:00 a.m. at Dholai PS through SDPO, Vairengte. As per input, leaders of MOTDA are willing to have a meeting inside Mizoram territory area only and not at Dholai PS.

As per input, leaders of MOTDA proceeded to Vairengte this morning i.e., dt. 25.9.2020 @ 5:00 a.m. and they held a meeting with leaders of Silchar Truck Drivers’ Association (STDA) at 1:00 p.m. at 1st IR Battalion Camp, Vairengte, located near Covid-19 Screening Point in presence of OC, Vairengte Police Station and OC, Dholai Police Station. 4 (four) members from STDA headed by Sams Uddin Majumder, President STDA and 6 (six) members from MODTA headed by Pu Romel Lalruatdika, President, MOTDA were present at the meeting. After deliberate discussion, both parties came to a conclusion that STDA will bear all expenses incurred on repair of damaged oil tankers and handed over Rs. 3,000 (three thousand) at the spot for treatment of injured persons at the incident. MOTDA also agreed to withdraw their FIR lodged at Dholai PS on 16.9.2020 and subsequently submitted an application for withdrawal of their FIR to OC, Dholai Police Station.

Recapping earlier related development on the said incident, leaders of various transport associations viz. Zoram Drivers Union, Mizoram Oil Tankers Driver Association, Mizoram Truck Drivers Association, Tipper Association, City Bus Drivers &amp; Conductor Association, Maxicab Owner Association, 407 Association, Mizoram Taxi Association, Mizoram Gas Drivers Association and Pick Up Drivers Association convened Joint Meeting on 21.9.2020 @ 11:00 a.m. at Zoram Drivers’ Union (ZDU) Office. The Joint Meeting decided to resort to road blockade for all vehicles entering into the State if no action is seen before 29.9.2020 regarding payment of compensation to the victims and expenses on repair of damaged vehicles as well as arrest of the accused persons.

In view of the above today’s positive development, it is believed that intention to organize road block as decided in the above Joint Meeting of various transport association will not be carried out. However, no official communication has been made or received yet in this regard, while writing this report.

Situation is under close watch.
