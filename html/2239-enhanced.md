Subject : - NATGRID - regarding

Sir,

 As you are aware, the Government of India is establishing National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) to be developed as an IT Platform for quick and trusted sharing of information from various data holders like Railways (for passengers, cargo and parcel data), Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (for vahan and Sarthi data), etc. The purpose of NATGRID is to assist the Intelligence and Law Enforcement Agencies in maintaining national and internal security with the focus to counter terror. Though NATGRID had earlier given access to selected Agencies, now they are extending access to state Police.

 As directed, to scrutinize project of NATGRID for Mizoram Police, there are few points which may be noted as under :

1. MoU (Memorandum of understanding) ;

Draft Memorandum had been prepared by them to be signed between National Intelligence Grid and State Police by laying down guidelines and certain responsibilities to be borne by the State polices. However, there exist neither burden nor liability if  consent had been given as an User Agency and signed the MoU.

1. Pre-requisite;

There are some components which need to be acquire and maintain by the User Agency/Police viz :-

1. State needs to have NICNET Connection – _could be arranged on being requested from NIC_
2. State needs to have Static IP on Gateway device on NICNET - _could be arranged on being requested from NIC_
3. State will have to provide Static IP to NATGRID – _could be provided after assigning static IP by NIC_
4. Gateway Device at State will have to whitelist NATGRID provided ports and block rest communication ports for NATGRID IP like RDP, etc. – _could be done at ease_
5. State workstation connecting to NATGRID should have basic security and hardening like Anti malware software, Security Patches etc - _Workstation (one computer set with working spaces) need to be set up at the premises of Nodal officer or Application Nodal Officer and the said anti malware software and others may be purchased from available market_
6. State will have to install NATGRID provided VPN – Client - _no issue_
7. State will ensure that the authorized workstation will be used to connect NATGRID and access NATSTAR Connector only. The workstation will not be used for any other purpose i.e. it will be a dedicated workstation for use of NATSTAR Connector. – _a separate room need to be arranged from the available building or construct a new one._

1. Nodal Officers :

 Apart from the components, User Agencies/State Police needs to nominate and submit the list of Nodal Officer ( for MoU purposes/not below the rank of IG), Application Nodal Officer (Not below the rank of ASP) and Master Trainers &amp; Users Team members.

 It is suggested that IGP(intel) may be nominated as Nodal Officer and SP CID(Crime) as Application Nodal Officer. The Master Trainers &amp; User Team may be appointed later on by SP(CID) Crime.

 Submitted for your kind information please.

Yours faithfully,
