**Protected Area Permit (PAP):**

- The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, via Notification No. 25022/160/2010-F.I dated December 30, 2010, suspended the Protected Area Permit requirement from January 1, 2011, for a duration of one year.

- The suspension of PAP in Mizoram has been extended periodically by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The most recent extension was executed via Notification No. 25022/160/2010-F.I dated December 16, 2022, extending the suspension up to December 31, 2027.

**Withdrawal of Protected Area Suspension Order:**

- On December 17, 2024, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, issued an order (ref. No. 25022/160/2010-F.I (Part.I)(i) dated 17.12.2024) immediately canceling the Protected Area Permit (PAP) suspension. Consequently, the entire regions of Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland have been reinstated as protected areas under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, due to increased security concerns along their borders.

- Furthermore, the Ministry of Home Affairs has mandated that all PAP/RAP applications be processed exclusively through the e-FRRO Portal. No physical PAP/RAP permits will be issued under any circumstances as per the directive (Letter No. 25022/160/2010-F.I (Part.I)(ii) dated 17.12.2024).

**Current Status:**

- Mizoram falls under the jurisdiction of the Foreigner Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) in Kolkata, along with other northeastern states.

- The Senior Superintendent of Police, CID (SB), serves as the State Nodal Officer and the State Foreigner Registration Officer (FRO). Additionally, it acts as the District FRO for Aizawl District.

- Each District's Superintendent of Police in Mizoram performs the role of District FRO for their respective districts.

- In line with the directive from the Ministry of Home Affairs requiring that all PAP/RAP applications be processed through the e-FRRO Portal, a training session on Immigration Visa Foreigner Registration Tracking (IVFRT), PAP, and RAP was held on January 10, 2025. This training was organized for the State FRO and all District FROs at the Cyber Forensic cum Training Centre, SP Office, Aizawl, Mizoram and was conducted by the Deputy Director of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), Mizoram.

**Manpower Situation:**

The Senior Superintendent of Police (Sr. SP) of CID (SB) is appointed as the State Foreigners Registration Officer. This unit, through the Foreigners Registration Branch, is responsible for executing the Immigration, Visa, Foreigners Registration &amp; Tracking (IVFRT) Project. This includes: i) the e-FRRO portal, ii) the District Police Module, iii) the Nationality Status Verification Portal, and iv) the C-Form/S-Form Portal. Additionally, this branch is managing the implementation of the Passport Seva Project Portal with only eight police personnel of various ranks. Given the severe manpower shortage described above, it is believed that additional staff will be necessary for the nodal unit, i.e., the FRO and Sr. SP, CID (SB), in due course to efficiently perform these functions.

**Actions Taken :**

1. On January 10, 2025, a hands-on training session on utilizing the online Protected Area Permit via the e-FRRO portal was held at the Cyber Forensic-cum-Training Centre in the SP, Aizawl Office. Attendees included representatives from the State Foreigners Registration Office (FRO), District FROs, and SP Security.

2. A meeting to address issues related to the Protected Area Permit (PAP) took place on January 27, 2025, at 11:00 AM in the office chamber of the Secretary, Home Department, Government of Mizoram.

**The Free Movement Regime (FMR) along the Indo-Myanmar Border :**

 Mizoram shares a 510-kilometer-long border with Myanmar, which remains unfenced and porous. Six districts in the state adjoin the international border, with Champhai district sharing the longest border with Myanmar.

1. _Brief history :_

 The Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that enables citizens of both countries to travel freely within a 16-kilometer radius of the border for up to 72 hours without the need for a visa. This initiative aims to preserve traditional ties and alleviate insecurity for tribal communities residing along the border.

 The FMR spans 1,629.5 kilometers of unfenced border shared between four Indian states - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram - and Myanmar. In January 2018, the Union Cabinet approved a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance economic interactions through this regime.

 However, concerns have been raised regarding the regime's misuse. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, militants and criminals are exploiting the FMR to smuggle weapons, narcotics, and counterfeit currency, taking advantage of the regime's leniencies to cross borders and evade capture.

1. _Border Fencing and Free Movement Regime Abolition :_

 On February 28, 2024, the Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Indian government’s proposal to build a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and to abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR). Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution expresses concerns that these measures would negatively impact the Zo ethnic communities, which have been historically divided by the border established during British colonial rule. The Assembly contends that strengthening this division with additional barriers would disturb the livelihoods and social connections of the border communities.

1. _FMR New Guidelines (Free Movement Limit On Indo-Myanmar Border Tightened to 10 Km, With Border Pass) :_

As per MHA Notification on dated December 24, 2024, the FMR range has been reduced from 16 kilometers to 10 kilometers on either side of the international border. The revised regulations, which came into effect on December 30, 2024, mandate the issuance of a Border Pass for residents within the 10-kilometer zone, permitting a stay of up to seven days.

1. Exemption under G.S.R. No. 1265:

  The Central Government, vide G.S.R. No. 1265, has exempted members of hill tribes, whether citizens of India or Myanmar, residing in the border areas under the Free Movement Regime, from the requirement of Rule 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950, subject to specified conditions.

2. Meeting chaired by Secretary (BM), MHA:

  On December 16, 2024, a meeting was convened under the chairmanship of the Secretary (Border Management), MHA, wherein State Governments were informed of the Government of India’s decision to regulate the FMR through the issuance of Border Passes. The Border Pass will be issued by the Assam Rifles based on the following criteria:

 -Proof of Identity (POI): A certificate issued by OC/SHO of Local Police Station (PS) or the local village chief/authority, confirming that the individual belongs to a village within 10 kilometers on either side of the international border.

 -Passport: The passport of the individual must indicate the address and name of the village falling within the 10-kilometer zone on either side of the international border.

1. **Narcotics drugs smuggling trends/Opium cultivation in Chin State and possible nexus among IIGs**

The modus operandi and ways of concealment of smuggled narcotics used by smugglers is constantly evolving. The past seizures of narcotics in the state revealed that these drugs are often concealed in sealed food packages, vegetables, electrical goods and more commonly inside a car door panel or costumed concealed compartment inside a vehicle. Further, the emerging trend of using end to end encrypted messaging applications and compartmentalizing activities like logistics, finances or intelligence gathering by different groups or units complicated the interception of modern narcotics syndicates.
