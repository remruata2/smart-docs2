**Vulnerability of Mizoram border:**

 Mizoram has a long porous international border with two countries (496.531 kms with Myanmar and 319.791 kms with Bangladesh).****It is reported that******over 2,70,000 Rohingyas refugees have recently entered Bangladesh through border points of Chittagong Division (Bandarban, Rangamati &Khagrachhari Cox Bazar, etc).****As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division , further infiltration of illegal migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.**

Border points i.e B.P.1 to B.P.17 of Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across these border points i.e BP 1 to BP17 (Mizoram–Myanmar border).

**Suggested measures to be taken for prevention of illegal entry of Rohingyas migrants of Myanmar into Mizoram.**

**(i)Strengthening of Security and Intelligence Network along Mizoram -Bangladesh Border and Mizoram-Indo Myanmar Border****.**

 There are 3 (three) Battalions of Assam Rifles deployed along the Indo-Myanmar border and 3 (three) Battalions of BSF deployed along Indo-Bangladesh border. In addition, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) along the border supplementing the Central Armed Forces.

 Apart from strengthening deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) and Assam Rifle along the border. It is also necessary to set-up new Police Stations/Out post (with the financial assistance of Central government) within this areas to act as a second layer behind the BSF/Assam Rifles for keeping effective watch on the infiltration of Rohingyas migrants and other cross border criminal activities.

**(ii)****Fencing of****Mizoram-Bangladesh border.**

 In order to prevent illegal migration and illegal activities including anti-national activities from across the border, the Government of India had sanctioned the construction of border fencing with floodlights in two phases. The total length of Indo-Bangladesh border sanctioned for fencing is 3326.14 km; out of which about 2731 km of fencing has so far been completed (up to 31.12.2016). The fencing work should be expedited.

 (**iii)Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agencies and Intelligence agencies about Rohingyas Crisis and its security implication, etc**

  Mizoram Police, etc should be sensitized about Rohingyas crisis so as to enable them to take prompt steps in identifying the illegal migrants and to initiate the process of deportation, etc. This could be achieved through Seminar, Workshop, etc.

**(iv)Detection and deportation of foreigners along Mizoram-Bangladesh/Mizoram-Myanmar Border.**

****(1) Special Task Force (STF) :****

 In order to detect and deport settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram , 3 (three) Special Task Force (STF) had already been set up in three districts of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.

__Similarly, Special Task Force (specially for Rohingyas migrants of Myanmar) may also be set up at the district level to identify and deport illegal staying of Rohingyas migrants__inside the territory of Mizoram_._

**(2)****Arrest of Rohingyas by Mizoram Police:**

  Till today i.e 30.12.2019, no Rohingyas refugees from Rakhine State of Myanmar have taken shelter in any part of Mizoram. However, there are 32 illegal immigrants (ie, Rohingya) apprehended in the state of Mizoram. It may be mentioned that necessary action for their deportation process has already been initiated and instruction from Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi is still awaited.

**Myanmar Refugees :**

 The State of Mizoram has witnessed cross border incidents like fleeing of 1615 Nos. of Myanmarese from villages like Varang, etc., under Paletwa township of Chin State, Myanmar into the following villages of Mizoram due to fierce clashes between Arakan Army (AA) militants and the Myanmar Army (MA). The refugees were residing at the following villages as arrangement made by State Government.

(i) Laitlang  - 443

(iv) Zochachhuah****- 707

_(They are accommodated in 80 temporary shelters. It is reported that 26 refugees left Hmawngbuchhuah during 1st – 6th May, 2018)_

**Mizoram-Bangladesh:**

 BSF is entrusted to guard the Mizoram-Bangladesh border. Mizoram has no boundary dispute/issues with Bangladesh. Border Fencing is in progress. Being a porous border and due to socio – cultural affinities between people residing in both sides of the border, there exist frequent movement of people across the border. Border trade is also being carried out at various locations.

 2 (two) Bangladeshi nationals, namely (i) Mahmud Hassan (25) s/o Gulbarg Ali, Magura, Bangladesh and (ii) MohamadSayadHussain (35) s/o ShayaibHussain, Magura, Bangladesh were apprehended by BSF personnel stationed at Silsuri BOP on ground of suspicion of involvement in anti-national activities and produced before Marpara PS and C/No.7/19 dt.29.7.2019 u/s 471/476 IPC r/w 14 A(b) Foreigners Act was registered. Joint interrogation with sister Agencies reveals that they are members of Ansar-Al-Islam, an extremist outfit in Bangladesh and they are sent to find suitable safe place in Mizoram western border area and to find arms smugglers who could provide arms and ammunitions to their organization.

**NOTE ON STRENGTHENING OF SECURITY AT INDO- BANGLADESH BORDER AND ISSUES OF DETECTION AND DEPORTATION OF FOREIGNERS**

The Indian side of the Indo-Bangladesh border passes through West Bengal (2216.7 km), Assam (263 km), Meghalaya (443 km), Tripura (856 km) and Mizoram (318 km). The entire stretch consists of plains, riverine belts, hills &amp; jungles. The area is heavily populated and is cultivated right upto the border.

 The Indo-Bangladesh border is marked by a high degree of porosity and the checking of illegal cross border activities and illegal migration from Bangladesh into India have been major challenges. In order to prevent illegal migration and illegal activities including anti-national activities from across the border, the Government of India had sanctioned the construction of border fencing with floodlights in two phases.

The total length of Indo-Bangladesh border sanctioned for fencing is 3326.14 km; out of which about 2731 km of fencing has so far been completed (up to 31.12.2016).

**Fencing of Mizoram-Bangladesh border:**

  The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was Km 348.68 km out of which about 154.00 Km work have been completed.

 According to Mizoram State Boundary Committee, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram are now within Bangladesh side of the border due to irresponsibility of the construction companies who are fencing the Mizoram- Bangladesh border. The Boundary Committee also found that the fences pass through the middle of 20 other villages.

 Border fencing work could not be undertaken along a 60-km stretch in the Dampa Tiger Reserve owing to pending clearances from the National Board of Wildlife, which has demanded that the State transfer of around 1,520 hectares of non-forestland in compensation.

**Strengthening of Security along Mizoram –Bangladesh Border**

There are 3 (three) Battalions of BSF deployed along Indo-Bangladesh border. In addition, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) along the border supplementing the central armed forces at selected strategic locations.

Illegal migration is significantly altering the demographic pattern of the border districts adjoining Bangladesh. While our general approach has been to improve the front line of the Border Security Force(BSF). It is also necessary that the State Governments be given assistance by the Centre to set-up civil police stations which could act as second layer behind the BSF/Border Out Posts(BOPs) to keep effective watch on happenings in border villages.
