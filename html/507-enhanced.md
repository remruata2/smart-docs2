****M/S PRASAD & COMPANY PROJECT WORKS LTD. AIZAWL, MIZORAM****

1. M/S. Prasad &amp; Company Project works ltd. occupies H.No.-09,M-1,Block–C, Chaltlang Venglai, Aizawl, Mizoram, owned by Mr. Kennet Manga who is presently working as the Dy. General Manager at Apex Bank ltd., Mizoram.

1. In the said building, the company runs an office having 3 office staffs –Cashier, Accountant, Office Assistant under the supervision of Mr. S. Maniraju, Executive Director of the company and also he is applicant for the same.

1. The company has occupied the said building since 2005 till date i.e 14.3.2019 on monthly rental rate of Rs.19,000/-.

1. The company has completed central scheme Project works in Mizoram such as: –

i) Constrction of Ch. Chhunga Bus Terminal, Thuampui, Aizawl

ii) Construction of Ch. Saprawnga Truck terminal, Rangvamual,Aizawl

iii) Construction of NEILIT, Zuangtui, Aizawl

iv)Construction of Champhai Shopping Complex, Champai

1. The company is presently working on two Project works :

i) Construction of Sainik school, Chhingchhip (Final stage) and

ii) Border Fencing &amp; Road construction along Indo-Bangladesh border in Mizoram.

1. On date 14.07.2016, the NBCC limited accepted the tender offer by M/s Prasad &amp; company ltd., contract value of Rs.232,31,91327 for Border fencing &amp; Road construction from Kaislam to Silsuri i.e. Package –I and contract value Rs.231,31,91327 from Kaislam to Andermanik .i.e package-II.

1. In border fencing project works, there are 300 (approx) workers/ labors within Package –I and 280 (approx) workers in Package –II under the supervision of Mr. Himagiri Project Manager, Ph-9366833511 and Mr.Manikuntha, Mechanical Engineer Ph-8880423456 assists by two accountants.

  Therefore, it is learnt that the above mentioned Indo- Bangladesh border falls on the western belt of Mizoram i.e. Mamit District where no telephone/ internet services are available. Since lack of telephonic communication, the project work needs establishment of W.T stations for supervision of such a huge construction workers.

 

If the firm is granted for W.T license, it is suggested that W.T sets should be used only on the area of the said Project work i.e. Indo-Bangladesh Border under strictly control and supervision. Before starting up, the firm should consult the state concerned authority i.e. Mizoram Police Radio Organization (MPRO) for setting up of the specific frequency.

 In light of the above enquiry, nothing is found against the applicant firm which would render it unsuitable for the grant of the said W.T license for a limited period of time.
