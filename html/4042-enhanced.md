**II) IMB FENCE AND ROAD PROJECT**

1. **IMB Fence**
2. **IMB Fence**

1. **IMB Fence**

 Mizoram shares a 510-kilometer-long border with Myanmar, which remains unfenced and porous. Six districts in the state adjoin the international border, with Champhai district sharing the longest border with Myanmar.

 **On February 28, 2024, the Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Indian government’s proposal to build a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and to abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR).** Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution expresses concerns that these measures would negatively impact the Zo ethnic communities, which have been historically divided by the border established during British colonial rule. The Assembly contends that strengthening this division with additional barriers would disturb the livelihoods and social connections of the border communities.

Zo Reunification Organisation (ZORO) has already opposed the decision to fence Indo-Myanmar Border (IMB) and abrogation of Free Movement Regime (FMR) last year i.e. 2024 and they have organized Peaceful Protest Rally at Vaphaiand Zokhawthar, both Champhai district on 16.05.2024, participated by around 280 (two hundred eighty) persons and around 1000 (one thousand) persons respectively and both the rally ended peacefully.

Recently, consequent upon the revised FMR guidelines, ZORO staged symbolic protests across various locations in Mizoram on 29.01.2025 condemning the restrictions on the Free Movement Regime (FMR) and proposed construction of border fencing. The protests were held in Aizawl, Mimbung(Saitual District), Lunglei, Serchhip, and Champhai, with a total of 150 (one hundred fifty) participants wherein the protestors burnt Government of India and Mizoram Government orders on new FMR restrictions and guidelines. All these protests ended peacefully.

1. **KMMTTP**
2. **KMMTTP**

1. **KMMTTP**

 The Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) is a strategic infrastructure initiative by the Government of India. It involves a multimodal transport route that combines land, river, and sea segments to connect Northeast India with Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal. The route covers a distance of 882.21 kilometers and includes multiple modes of transportation.

**Lawngtlai to Zorinpui (Mizoram)**: land route 87.51 kms.

**Zorinpui Border to Kaletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 45 kms.

**Kaletwa to Paletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 60.70 kms.

**Paletwa to Sittwe (Myanmar)**: 150 km river route.

**Sittwe to Kolkata Port (Bay of Bengal)**: 539 km sea route.

 As of June 2024, construction of the KMMTTP land route within Mizoram is complete, although it is occasionally disrupted by landslides due to heavy rainfall. Meanwhile, owing to ongoing conflicts in Myanmar, only about 10 kilometers of earthwork has been completed on the land route between Zorinpui and Paletwa by the Myanmar New Power Construction Company, the firm assigned to the project.

 Since February 2024, the Arakan Army, which primarily consists of ethnic Arakanese from Myanmar's Rakhine State, has reportedly taken control of most of Rakhine State, including some parts of Chin State. This control extends over the proposed route of the KMMTTP within Myanmar, with the exception of Sittwe. However, due to ongoing clashes between the Myanmar Army and resistance forces elsewhere in Myanmar, the Arakan Army and the civilians in Rakhine State have become heavily reliant on goods and petroleum products transported largely through Mizoram, notably Lawngtlai and Siaha Districts.

**III) ENTRY AND EXIT POINTS ALONG IMB:**

The Indian government has introduced new regulations to oversee movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). On December 24, 2024, the MHA announced a revised protocol that decreases the Free Movement Regime (FMR) range, shrinking it from 16 km to 10 km.

Security along the 510-km Indo-Myanmar border has been intensified, and now residents residing within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border must secure a Border Pass for travel. The new regulations restrict the movement of individuals from 16 km under the previous FMR to 10 km now, on either side. Only those residing in the "border area"—defined as within 10 km on either side—are eligible to apply for the "Border Pass" for up to a seven-day stay; such pass-holders are required to return it at the same crossing point where it was issued. Residents of villages beyond the "border areas" (the 10-km zone) and citizens of any third country are ineligible for the Border Pass. As per MHA letter, **there are total eighteen(18) identified Entry/Exit points in six(06) districts of Mizoram and five(05) Entry/Exit points covered in Pilot Phase and Phase-I have been operative till date.**

**PILOT PHASE:**The new guidelines was implemented w.ef. 30.12.2024 at Zokhawthar and Hnahlan, which are pilot sites for new Entry and Exit point. The number of Border Pass issued till date is given below:

| **Sl No** | **Name of Crossing Points** | **Movement** | **Border Pass Issued** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Zokhawthar, Champhai District | Myanmar into India | 2299 | 530 persons overstayed |
|  |  | India to Myanmar | 34 |  |
| 2 | Hnahlan, Champhai District | Myanmar into India | 26 | 2 persons overstayed |
|  |  | India to Myanmar | 17 |  |


**Main reasons for overstay:**

1. No mechanism to check whether the incoming Myanmar citizens have crossed the 10 km radius from the IMB.
2. Tracing of those who overstayed is difficult since the system which issued Border Pass does not mandate phone number or any other features which could help Police to trace overstayals.
3. Some have returned to Myanmar from other routes which are not covered in the Pilot Phase since there are 28 identified crossing points in Champhai district alone.
4. Lack of awareness among the public. Those who will be overstaying should apply to renew their Border pass/permit.

**PHASE-I:**Entry and Exit point along with Indo-Myanmar Border at Lawngtlai District in Mizoram started operation w.e.f. from 23.01.2025 in these places:-

| **S/No** | **District** | **Name of Crossing Points** | **Closest BP** | **Closest COB** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Lawngtlai | Zochachhuah | BP-09 | COB Zorinpui/20 AR |
| 2 | Lawngtlai | Hruitezawl | BP-08 | COB Zorinpui/20 AR |
| 3 | Lawngtlai | Laitlang | BP-08 | COB Zorinpui/20AR |


The identified check gates in each of these areas is deemed too far from the villages and a meeting on 21.01.2025 at 05:15 pm held under the chairmanship of Secretary (BM), MHA on the entry/Exit points along Indo-Myanmar Border(IBM) resolved that it must be re-verified. After the verification, the same duty point for Entry/Exit point as proposed is approved and SP Lawngtlai posted 2 police personnel in each of these 3 places.Border Pass/Permit issued in these three(03) Entry/Exit points till date is given below:

| **Sl No** | **Name of Crossing Points** | **Movement** | **Border Pass Issued** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Zochachhuah, LawngtlaiDistrict | Myanmar into India | 10 | 3 persons overstayed |
|  |  | India to Myanmar | NIL |  |
| 2 | Hruitezawl, Lawngtlai District | Myanmar into India | NIL |  |

**IV) LAND ACQUISITION FOR INDO-BANGLADESH FENCE & BOPS:**

The agenda point pertains to BSF and Home Department.

**V) FOREIGNERS IDENTIFICATION PORTAL (FIP):**

The Foreigners Identification Portal (FIP) is designed for recording the personal and biometric information of foreign nationals residing illegally. Currently, access to FIP is limited to the District Deputy Commissioner in Mizoram, as the Police Department does not yet have access.

In a Council of Ministers meeting held on September 27, 2023, at 10:30 AM in the Chief Minister's Office Cabinet Room, the issue of documenting the biographic and biometric data of illegal migrants in Mizoram was addressed. It was concluded that, given the impending General Elections to the Mizoram State Assembly, the Government of Mizoram should not undertake the collection of such data. Therefore, the identification of foreigners residing illegally is not feasible at that time.

Consequently, the Commissioner &amp; Secretary to the Mizoram Government's Home Department was asked to guide the Police Department on using the Foreigners Identification Portal through letter No. MSB/VB-56/2024/4 dated March 18, 2024. A reply from the relevant authority is still awaited.

The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Foreigners Identification Portal, under the Foreigners Division, MHA, currently utilized by the Government of Mizoram, was created by NIC, MHA on February 2, 2024.

1. The FIP comprises six fields: Application Details (Mandatory) Address Details in Origin Country (Mandatory) Address Details in India (Mandatory) Identity Details (Mandatory) Occupation in Origin Country Occupation in India
2. Application Details (Mandatory)
3. Address Details in Origin Country (Mandatory)
4. Address Details in India (Mandatory)
5. Identity Details (Mandatory)
6. Occupation in Origin Country
7. Occupation in India

1. Application Details (Mandatory)
2. Address Details in Origin Country (Mandatory)
3. Address Details in India (Mandatory)
4. Identity Details (Mandatory)
5. Occupation in Origin Country
6. Occupation in India

1. The State Government has no objections and the foreigners have no issues regarding the application details.

1. Foreigners, particularly displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh, do not possess e-mail IDs, which are mandatory for the Address Detail field.

1. In the mandatory Address Details in India section, State Government officials and displaced individuals from Myanmar and Bangladesh are unable to specify their Entry Dates into India accurately. These individuals often enter through multiple points and frequently travel back and forth due to circumstances in their home countries. Additionally, they cannot determine the required Area Code, which is also mandatory.

1. The section on the Agency or Individual responsible for sending individuals to India is irrelevant for displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh.

1. Regarding the mandatory Identity Details, displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh lack the necessary documents for uploading to the Portal. Additionally, there is difficulty in uploading the Myanmar embassy form, as the State Government does not have access to it.

1. There are no issues with the Occupation in Origin Country and Occupation in India fields, as these are not mandatory.

1. Due to strong ancestral ties with displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh, and considering the unstable political situations in Myanmar and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the State Government believes that deporting or pushing back these refugees should not be pursued until their safety and security can be assured. Consequently, the State Government suggests that the relevance of the Embassy Form be reconsidered by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

**Notes:**

1. The Embassy Form is to be reviewed by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). It will be communicated with the embassies of the concerned countries in India to confirm the nationality of the illegal migrants/displaced persons, facilitating the issuance of necessary travel documents for their immediate deportation.

2. Regarding the capture of biometric details of displaced persons from Myanmar and Bangladesh under the NAFIS Portal, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) finalized necessary revisions to the portal to accommodate the specific needs of these displaced individuals on May 3, 2024.
