****Notes for Boundary Meeting for 16.04.2025****

1. **Mizoram-Assam Boundary Dispute:**

1. **Brief history** :

 The Mizoram-Assam border, defined by the Constitution of India 1935, spans 164.6 km. Historically, Mizoram and Assam have contested the exact demarcation of this boundary. Mizoram claims a 1875 boundary marked by the British-era Inner Line Reserve Forest, while Assam adheres to a 1933 Survey of India map as its constitutional boundary.

1. **Bone of Contention :**

 The crux of the dispute lies in differing interpretations of the border's demarcation. Mizoram asserts that the Inner Line Reserve Forest should be the boundary, while Assam upholds the 1933 map. This fundamental disagreement has led to a series of confrontations and skirmishes over the years.

**Recent Events :**

The conflict has intensified with notable incidents :

- **27.02.2018**: The Mizoram Zirlai Pawl (MZP) constructed a rest house at Bairabi Zophai, which was demolished by Assam Police and Forest Officials, claiming it was within Assam’s territory.

- **30.06.2021**: Tensions peaked when approximately 60 youths from Vairengte, aiming to set up a camp at Aitlang, Vairengte for Mizoram Police, were stopped by Assam Police. This led to a standoff involving around 200 Assam Police personnel and 10 Mizoram Police. Assam Police, heavily outnumbering Mizoram forces, occupied the disputed area, prompting Mizoram's retreat to maintain status quo.

- **26.07.2021**: The situation escalated further when around 200 Assam Police, led by IGP Anurag Agarwal, attempted to forcefully remove Mizoram Police from their camp located at Vairengte Auto Stand. The confrontation turned violent with Assam Police using tear gas and smoke bombs. A series of exchanges of gunfire ensued, resulting in injuries on both sides. Properties, including vehicles, were damaged or set ablazed by unknown miscreants.

**High-Level Meetings :**

Efforts to resolve the dispute include several high-level meetings:

- **27.07.2021**:****Chief Secretary level meeting alongwith DGP’s of both States chaired by Union Home Secretary at New Delhi.****
- **05.08.2021**: A Ministerial level border talks meeting in Aijal Club, Mizoram.
- **09.08.2022**: Another Ministerial level meeting in Aijal Club.
- **17.11.2022**: Ministerial level Discussions in Guwahati, Assam.
- **09.08.2024**: Ministerial level latest talks in Mizoram’s State Guest House.

The Mizoram-Assam boundary dispute remains a complex issue, marked by historical grievances and sporadic violence. Continued dialogue and negotiation are crucial for achieving a lasting resolution.

1. **The Free Movement Regime along the Indo-Myanmar Border****:**

**1) Brief history:**

 The Free Movement Regime (FMR), is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar allowing citizens to travel freely within 16 km of the border for up to 72 hours without a visa. This initiative aims to maintain traditional ties and alleviate insecurity for tribals residing along the border. The FMR covers 1,629.5 km of unfenced border shared between four Indian states viz. Arunachal Pradesh Nagaland Manipur and Mizoram with Myanmar.

 In January 2018, the Union Cabinet approved a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance economic interactions through this regime. However, concerns have arisen about its misuse. The Ministry of Home Affairs reported that militants and criminals exploit the FMR to smuggle weapons, narcotics, and counterfeit currency, taking advantage of the regime's leniencies to cross borders and evade capture.

**2) Enhancing Security and Mobility:**

 To address these issues, a committee led by the Special Secretary (Internal Security) was established in August 2017. The committee's mandate includes creating standardized procedures and guidelines for the FMR, delineating roles for central and state agencies, and developing a uniform Border Pass system. This pass will enable secure movement within the 16 km border area, with strict controls to prevent misuse.

The committee also plans to implement biometric cards for local residents and ensure that unauthorized vehicle crossings are prevented. The new measures are designed to balance the benefits of the FMR with enhanced security to safeguard both nations and their border communities.

**3) Border Fencing and Free Movement Regime Abolition**

  Mizoram shares a 510-kilometer-long border with Myanmar, which remains unfenced and porous. Six districts in the state adjoin the international border, with Champhai district sharing the longest border with Myanmar.

  On February 28, 2024, the Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Indian government’s proposal to build a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and to abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR). Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution expresses concerns that these measures would negatively impact the Zo ethnic communities, which have been historically divided by the border established during British colonial rule. The Assembly contends that strengthening this division with additional barriers would disturb the livelihoods and social connections of the border communities.

Peaceful Protest Rally against the Government of India's decision to fenced Indo-Myanmar Border (IMB) and abrogation of Free Movement Regime (FMR) was organised by Zo Reunification Organisation (ZORO) at Lal Mual, Vaphai on 16.05.2024 @ 7:00 a.m. The peace rally participated by around 280 (two hundred eighty) persons ended peacefully at around 08:00 a.m. The Peaceful Rally was also organised at Zokhawthar on 16.05.2024 @ 11:00 a.m. and participated by almost around 1000 (one thousand) demonstrators.

1. **KMMTTP****:**

  The Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) is a strategic infrastructure initiative by the Government of India. It involves a multimodal transport route that combines land, river, and sea segments to connect Northeast India with Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal. The route covers a distance of 882.21 kilometers and includes multiple modes of transportation.

**Lawngtlai to Zorinpui (Mizoram)**: land route 87.51 kms.

**Zorinpui Border to Kaletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 45 kms.

**Kaletwa to Paletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 60.70 kms.

**Paletwa to Sittwe (Myanmar)**: 150 km river route.

**Sittwe to Kolkata Port (Bay of Bengal)**: 539 km sea route.

   As of June 2024, construction of the KMMTTP land route within Mizoram is complete, although it is occasionally disrupted by landslides due to heavy rainfall. Meanwhile, owing to ongoing conflicts in Myanmar, only about 10 kilometers of earthwork has been completed on the land route between Zorinpui and Paletwa by the Myanmar New Power Construction Company, the firm assigned to the project.

  Since February 2024, the Arakan Army, which primarily consists of ethnic Arakanese from Myanmar's Rakhine State, has reportedly taken control of most of Rakhine State, including some parts of Chin State. This control extends over the proposed route of the KMMTTP within Myanmar, with the exception of Sittwe. However, due to ongoing clashes between the Myanmar Army and resistance forces elsewhere in Myanmar, the Arakan Army and the civilians in Rakhine State have become heavily reliant on goods and petroleum products transported largely through Mizoram, notably Lawngtlai and Siaha Districts. Concurrently, tensions between the Arakan Army and Chin ethnic armed groups in Myanmar have led the Central Young Lai Association (CYLA) to ban the transport of essential goods and petroleum oil into Myanmar, in solidarity with their Chin counterparts since April 2024. Currently, the ban is restricted only to the transportation of petroleum oil and fertilizers through Lawngtlai District.

**D. Entry and Exit points along IMB :**

The Indian government has introduced new regulations to oversee movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). On December 24, 2024, the MHA announced a revised protocol that decreases the Free Movement Regime (FMR) range, shrinking it from 16 km to 10 km. Despite Union Home Minister Amit Shah's earlier statement in February of the previous year, suggesting the FMR would be abolished, a formal notification has yet to be issued.

Security along the 510-km border has been intensified, and now residents residing within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border must secure a Border Pass for travel. The new regulations restrict the movement of individuals from 16 km under the previous FMR to 10 km now, on either side. Only those residing in the "border area"—defined as within 10 km on either side—are eligible to apply for the "Border Pass" for up to a seven-day stay; such pass-holders are required to return it at the same crossing point where it was issued. Residents of villages beyond the "border areas" (the 10-km zone) and citizens of any third country are ineligible for the Border Pass. . These new guidelines came into force from 30.12.2024, at Zokhawthar and Hnahlan, located in Champhai District, along the Mizoram-Myanmar border. The Zokhawthar and Hnahlan is pilot site for the entry and Exit point.

1. **Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing** :
2. **Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing** :

1. **Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing** :

 The Indo-Bangladesh border, spanning approximately 4,096 kilometres, is one of the world’s longest international boundaries. This extensive border has seen significant efforts to bolster security and control migration through a comprehensive fencing project. The fencing along the Indo-Bangladesh border is largely completed, with over 75% installed. High-priority areas vulnerable to illegal crossings have been addressed, though some sections remain incomplete or need maintenance due to geographical challenges. The fencing primarily consists of barbed wire, supplemented by floodlights and surveillance systems.

**Land Acquisition for Indo_Bangladesh Fence & BOPs :**

**Fencing of the India-Bangladesh Border:**

 The construction of the India-Bangladesh border fence began in Mizoram in 2005. The total proposed length of the fence along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border is 344.41 kilometers, of which approximately 75% has been completed.

 The Mizoram State Boundary Committee has reported that, due to the negligence of the companies responsible for the construction, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram now fall on the Bangladeshi side of the border. Additionally, the committee discovered that the fencing bisects 20 other villages.

 Border fencing has yet to be initiated along a 60-kilometres section within the Dampa Tiger Reserve. This delay is due to pending approvals from the National Board of Wildlife, which requires the state to provide about 1,520 hectares of non-forest land as compensation before granting clearance.

**Border Roads**

Along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border, 303.97 kilometers of border patrol roads have been constructed out of an approved total length of approximately 602.28 kilometers.

**Border Outposts (BOPs)**

Of the 91 approved BSF Border Outposts (BOPs), construction has been completed for 18 BOPs. The remaining 73 BOPs are yet to be established along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border. Additionally, Mizoram Police have deployed security personnel from the Indian Reserve Battalion (IR Bn) along the Indo-Bangladesh border, particularly on the western side of Mamit District, Mizoram.

**F. Foreigners Identification Portal (FIP):**

The Foreigners Identification Portal (FIP) is designed for recording the personal and biometric information of foreign nationals residing illegally. Currently, access to FIP is limited to the District Deputy Commissioner in Mizoram, as the Police Department does not yet have access.

In a Council of Ministers meeting held on September 27, 2023, at 10:30 AM in the Chief Minister's Office Cabinet Room, the issue of documenting the biographic and biometric data of illegal migrants in Mizoram was addressed. It was concluded that, given the impending General Elections to the Mizoram State Assembly, the Government of Mizoram should not undertake the collection of such data. Therefore, the identification of foreigners residing illegally is not feasible at this time.

Consequently, the Commissioner &amp; Secretary to the Mizoram Government's Home Department was asked to guide the Police Department on using the Foreigners Identification Portal through letter No. MSB/VB-56/2024/4 dated March 18, 2024. A reply from the relevant authority is still awaited.

The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Foreigners Identification Portal, under the Foreigners Division, MHA, currently utilized by the Government of Mizoram, was created by NIC, MHA on February 2, 2024.

****G. Protected Area Regime in the State of Mizoram :****

**Protected Area Coverage in Mizoram:**

- According to Section 3 of the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, no foreign national is permitted to enter or remain in a protected area without obtaining a permit issued by the Central Government or an authorized officer.

- As outlined in Section 2(a) of the same order, a 'protected area' is defined as any border area that lies beyond the inner line, as detailed in Schedule I.

- Schedule I of the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, specifies that the inner line in Mizoram extends from the tri-junction of Manipur, Mizoram, and Assam, following the northern and western borders of Mizoram up to the international boundary.

**Current System for Issuing Protected Area Permits to Foreigners for Entry into Mizoram:**

- According to Section 3 of the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, "No foreigner shall enter or remain in any protected area except under and in accordance with a permit issued by the Central Government or any officer authorized by the Central Government."

- Previously, travel agents would apply on behalf of foreigners wishing to enter Mizoram. The Secretary of the Home Department was responsible for issuing these entry permits to foreigners. The entire process of application submission and permit issuance was conducted manually.

**Suspension of the Protected Area Permit (PAP):**

- The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, via Notification No. 25022/160/2010-F.I dated December 30, 2010, suspended the Protected Area Permit requirement from January 1, 2011, for a duration of one year.

- The suspension of PAP in Mizoram has been extended periodically by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The most recent extension was executed via Notification No. 25022/160/2010-F.I dated December 16, 2022, extending the suspension up to December 31, 2027.

**Withdrawal of Protected Area Suspension Order:**

- On December 17, 2024, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, issued an order (ref. No. 25022/160/2010-F.I (Part.I)(i) dated 17.12.2024) immediately canceling the Protected Area Permit (PAP) suspension. Consequently, the entire regions of Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland have been reinstated as protected areas under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, due to increased security concerns along their borders.

- Furthermore, the Ministry of Home Affairs has mandated that all PAP/RAP applications be processed exclusively through the e-FRRO Portal. No physical PAP/RAP permits will be issued under any circumstances as per the directive (Letter No. 25022/160/2010-F.I (Part.I)(ii) dated 17.12.2024).

**Current Status:**

- Mizoram falls under the jurisdiction of the Foreigner Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) in Kolkata, along with other northeastern states.

- The Senior Superintendent of Police, CID (SB), serves as the State Nodal Officer and the State Foreigner Registration Officer (FRO). Additionally, It act as the District FRO for Aizawl District.

- Each district's Superintendent of Police in Mizoram performs the role of District FRO for their respective districts.

- In line with the directive from the Ministry of Home Affairs requiring that all PAP/RAP applications be processed through the e-FRRO Portal, a training session on Immigration Visa Foreigner Registration Tracking (IVFRT), PAP, and RAP was held on January 10, 2025. This training was organized for the State FRO and all District FROs at the Cyber Forensic cum Training Centre, SP Office, Aizawl, Mizoram and was conducted by the Deputy Director of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), Mizoram.

**Manpower Situation:**

The Senior Superintendent of Police (Sr. SP) of CID (SB) is appointed as the State Foreigners Registration Officer. This unit, through the Foreigners Registration Branch, is responsible for executing the Immigration, Visa, Foreigners Registration &amp; Tracking (IVFRT) Project. This includes: i) the e-FRRO portal, ii) the District Police Module, iii) the Nationality Status Verification Portal, and iv) the C-Form/S-Form Portal. Additionally, this branch is managing the implementation of the Passport Seva Project Portal with only eight police personnel of various ranks. Given the severe manpower shortage described above, it is believed that additional staff will be necessary for the nodal unit, i.e., the FRO and Sr. SP, CID (SB), in due course to efficiently perform these functions.

**Actions Taken :**

1. On January 10, 2025, a hands-on training session on utilizing the online Protected Area Permit via the e-FRRO portal was held at the Cyber Forensic-cum-Training Centre in the SP, Aizawl Office. Attendees included representatives from the State Foreigners Registration Office (FRO), District FROs, and SP Security. The resource person for this training was Rochungnunga Hrangchal, Deputy Director of NIC and State Coordinator of IVFRT in Mizoram.

2. A meeting to address issues related to the Protected Area Permit (PAP) took place on January 27, 2025, at 11:00 AM in the office chamber of the Secretary, Home Department, Government of Mizoram. The attendees were:
