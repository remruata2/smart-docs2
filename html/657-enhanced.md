****POINTS/ISSUES FOR INCLUSION IN THE AGENDA OF THE REGIONAL POLICE COORDINATION COMMITTEE MEETING SCHEDULED TO BE HELD AT MANIPUR****

**2. Sharing of intelligence of militant organizations including fundamentalist outfits**

  Close coordination as well as real-time dissemination of information and sharing of intelligence to tackle the activities of militant organizations including fundamentalist outfits are currently evident at the top level in Central and State Police Organizations. As far as militancy in Mizoram is concerned, the main militant group of the State – HPC(D) laid down their arms on 13th April, 2018. However, activities of militant outfits from other States/neighbouring countries in and around the bordering areas of Mizoram are often shared through proper channels, Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC), Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA), etc., by Mizoram Police to other Sister Intelligence Agencies and vice versa.

**4. Role of Social Media vis-à-vis law enforcement.**

 Today, ordinary citizens are more or less all connected to each other through Social Media such as, Facebook, Whatsapp, Youtube, etc., thanks to the advancement of information technology. The consequence of this advancement, for instance, is the emergence of Cyber Crime. However, closely monitoring Social Media and planting Sleeper Cells in this Social Media groups can often result in gaining access to the intention of radical groups, protesters, agitators, etc. Apart from these, discussion and comments of the public on the discussion of sensational cases through Social Media could produce crucial hints for an investigation process. These same Social Media can also be used for spreading awareness of different kinds by law enforcement agencies to a great effect.

**5. Measure and Psy ops to tackle growth and containment of extremists, fundamentalists and radical elements in Northeast.**

 Apart from HPC(D) - the insurgent groups of Mizoram who laid down their arms on 13th April, 2019, the other outfit, the Bru armed militants in the western belt of the State has been contained to great extent so much so that this group has become more or less a group of bandits without any specific demands or objectives. As for containment of extremists, fundamentalists and radical elements in the State, the fact that almost all of the whole population are following a common religion and speaking the same dialect have a great impact on the political and social psychology. If the sentiments of the people are carefully dealt with, these factors can be effectively utilized to curb any growing extremism in the close-knit society of Mizoram to a great extent.

**6. Sharing of technological advancements in the area of investigation and intelligence, etc.**

 Due to advancement in technology, approximately, 90% of Police cases needed technical assistance in order to collect evidences and detection of culprits. Investigating officers are assisted by providing Call Detail Records of suspects to disclose their involvement in the concerned cases or by tracking their involvement in the concerned cases or by tracking their involvements, relation with victims, frequent contacts and location of the suspects at the time of occurrence of crime.

 Moreover, collection of intelligence alone through human resource/intelligence has certain limits without the assistance of technical assistance. Due to the intervention of Technical Surveillance, Mizoram Police alone had detected and seized infinite amount of contraband items during the recent past.
