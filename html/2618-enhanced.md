****Investigation Report****

  The accused Lalliana was apprehended by the personnel of CID (SB) near Buichali bridge, Sairang along with his accomplice Huapzuava s/o Thanchhunga of Chaltlang dawrkawn, Aizawl. Checking of the vehicle they were traveling on , a TATA207 regd. No. MZ-01 D-8076 resulted in the recovery of arms and ammunitions from a false compartment under the floor of the vehicle. The two persons were arrested and the consignment was seized.

 

 Interrogation of the accused Lalliana revealed that he came to know two DHD members from his previous dealing, one of them he identified as Paul Dutta and the other’s name not known. During that dealing, they agreed for future dealings regarding supply of more arms to them.

 The accused, then, went to Burma and bought 19 (nineteen) AK-47 and 8307 rounds of ammunitions. He collected the 19 AK-47 Rifles from Wah insurgents @ 13 lakhs Kyats. He transported these weapons by packing them as ordinary goods along with other items. He transported it upto Tuisual (Hmuntha), Champhai District by vehicle. From there he brought it to Phaibawk, Champhai District (bordering Myanmar) by hiring porters.

 From Phaibawk he transported the consignment with Huapzauva’s TATA 207 upto Aizawl on 25.6.2008. After contacting Paul Dutta, one of the DHD members, they transported the consignment to Sairang for handing it over to the DHD where they were apprehended by the police @ 10:30 AM on 28.6.2008 at Buichali Bridge. The consignment was hid in a false chamber under the floor of the vehicle.

 The carrying charge was agreed at Rs. 1 lakh to be given to Huapzauva when the arms were sold. Exact place for handing over of arms and the selling rate of the AK-47 to the DHD is not known.

**PREVIOUS DEALING OR INVOLVEMENT:**In 2005, in partnership with his friend Suithanhranga @ Hranga @ Thanga of Chawng U Myanmar, he sold 4 AK-47 rifles to UPDF Commander Mukto Babu in Bangladesh. They acquired the arms from Wah insurgents in Myanmar @ 4 lakhs Kyats per rifle (approx. Rs. 20,000). They handed it to UPDF at Amtola @ 2 lakhs Bangladesh Takka per rifle.

 The same year, they sold another 2 (two) AK-47 to UPDF, at Massalong @ Rs. 2 lakhs per rifle which they acquired from the same Wah insurgents @ 6 lakhs Kyat per rifle.

 On May 2006, he supplied 10 nos. of AK-47 rifles to NSCN (IM) at Tiau River near Phaibawk @ Rs. 1.8 lakhs and 1.7 lakhs per rifle. The deal was made with one Aton, NSCN (IM) member, earlier at Aizawl. This time Lalliana acquired the rifles from the Shan insurgents of Myanmar.

 On April 2008, he sold 2 (two) AK-47 rifles to DHD at Bawngkawn (Lunglei road) @ Rs. 3.3. lakhs per rifle through his friend Suithanhranga @ Hranga. The two rifles were bought from the Wah insurgents in Burma @ Rs. 1lakhs per rifle. He identified one of the two DHD members as Paul Dutta.
