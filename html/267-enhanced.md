Subject: Threat Perception Assessment of Pu Lalrobiaka, MLA and Chairman, ZIDCO, Mizoram for issue of prohibited Bore Arm Licence.

Ref: No.L.14012/1(Aizawl)/2014-HMA Govt. of Mizoram, Home  Deptt. Dt. 24.11.2015.

Sir,

 Apropos the above, I am forwarding herewith assessment report and recommendation in respect of Pu Lalrobiaka, MLA and Chairman ZIDCO, Mizoram for favour of your kind information and necessary action.

 Inspr. Lalrinthanga Ralte, Field Staff, CID(SB) has conducted the assessment on threat perception of Pu Lalrobiaka s/o Sawnga (L) of Dinthar Veng, Aizawl who is currently the sitting MLA, representing Dampa Constituency. It is learnt that Pu Lalrobiaka, MLA did not receive any kind of threatening, verbally or physically so far. However Dampa Constituency lies near the International and State boundaries which is known to be the operated areas of militant outfits like Tuikuk (Bru), Chakma and NLFT who often moves to and fro in these areas and also there had been incidents like kidnapping/ abduction in these areas in the recent past.

 For the above reasons, it may be recommended that licence of prohibited Bore Arm be provided to Pu Lalrobiaka, MLA for self defence and for any eventuality that may cause risk to the security of his life.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
