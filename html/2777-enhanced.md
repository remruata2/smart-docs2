No.MSB/CB/B-104/477

Dated: 23rd June, 2021

**1. Activities of Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA):**

 6 (six) cadres of Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) carrying amrs entered into the Diltlang North VC area, Champhai district, Mizoram on 16.6.2021. They chased away 58 (fifty eight) Myanmar refugees (believed to be People Defense Force members) residing in a temporary refugee camp set up at the bank of Tiau river at Tuithoh forest area and burnt down their camps and other properties. The 58 refugees fled to Myanmar and they are presently seeking shelter at Ngente and Darkai village of Myanmar.

 Before their initial entry into Mizoram, the above 58 refugees sought permission from Pu Tawnga, VCP of Ngur village to allow their stay under Ngur village area, but the latter denied citing Covid-19 pandemic and as per his direction they set up temporary camp at Tuithoh Kai (Crossing point).

 As per input, the above ZRA cadres and Diltlang North VLTF also had an altercation on 16.6.2021, but ended without any physical violence and ZRA cadres subsequently withdrew and entered into Myanmar. Diltlang North YMA and VLTF on Covid-19 are strongly against entry of ZRA cadres into their area and they want Mizoram government to take necessary action to prevent their entry in future. While top Leaders/OBs of ZRA are residing in Manipur and the above cadres have their base in Myanmar at Darkai village area.

 ZRA are a member of United People Front (UPF), a union of different insurgent groups of Manipur, and they are currently having Suspension of Operation (SoO) with Indian government. Mr. Thanglianpauva, President of ZRA also used to be the Chairman of UPF and he is residing at ZRA designated camp at Songtal, Manipur.

 It is strongly believed that the above action of ZRA cadres was due to their support to Myanmar military government as they believed that the 58 persons are PDF members who are to undergo training to fight Myanmar military government. UNLF, which is the biggest insurgent group of Manipur, are having base inside Myanmar territory under the patronage of Myanmar military at Senam and Sikha area and they supported the Myanmar military and similarly ZRA also opposed any act against Myanmar military.

**2.** **Arakan Liberation Army (ALA)/Arakan Liberation Party (ALP):**

 Arakan Liberation Army (ALA) is a Rakhine insurgent group in Myanmar. It is the armed wing of the Arakan Liberation Party (ALP).
