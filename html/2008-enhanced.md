**Questions & Answers**

1. Did you acknowledge the secret meeting held between HPC’D’ and government of Mizoram at Silchar on Dt. 19.3.2015?

Ans :  No, I did not know anything of such meeting. Although I am Army Chief, decisions can be made by Executive council meeting and political Affairs Committee without my presence.

 I did not entirely know about Pu Zosangbera’s initiative to have a meeting with the government of Mizoram and I heard about the meeting around three days after it was held. As I am having health problems, I use to take treatment from one Professor at RIMS Hospital, Imphal, and for this reason I could not attend Executive Council’s meeting as regular as I want.

2. It was heard that at the council’s meeting your organization’s President Zosangbera had given report about the above mentioned secret meeting and further cited his hope to stop your organization cadre’s movement with arms as well as extortion activities. While having such positive initiative from both sides, what was the meaning of the recent unseemly incident (Ambush)?

Ans :  Even me, I do not understand, I did not know anything about Pu Zosangbera’s initiatives as well as decisions made by Executive Council’s Meeitng.

3. What were the agendas and meeting outcome of the HPC’D’ Executive Council’s meeting which was held on 9th April, 2015?

Ans : At the meeting, Zokhawthiang incident which occurred at Dt. 28.3.2015 was also discussed, however, detail report about the incident cannot be heard but the attended members agreed that the ambush was carried out by our cadres.

 A preview was also held on the upcoming VC election which is scheduled to be held on Dt. 30.4.2015 and the meeting could not understand how the state government hurriedly issued election notification while we are presently having demands towards the same. As for this reason, the meeting decided to boycott the said election by giving notification to every village within our demand areas not to file nomination in the said VC election, the meeting also agreed to take action upon anyone who violated the mentioned notification. This final decision was passed on Dt. 10.4.2015 and I was absent at that time since I already left for Imphal to consult my doctor, I was further delayed by Bandh, it was only after two days i.e. Dt. 12.4.2015 that I heard about the meeting’s decision.

 The above said HPC’D’ Executive Council meeting was held on 9th April 2015 at the resident of Pu Pawlsanga of Rengkai, Churachandpur, the following HPC’D’ members including myself attended the meeting -

a) Zosangbera - Chairman

b) Lalthangliana - Acting Chairman

c) Ruatsanga - Incharge Finance Hqrs.

d) Thansanga - Member JMG, (Recording Secretary)

e) Lalkhama @ Lka - PRO

f) F. Lalchhanhima - PRO

g) Lalbiaknunga - Dy. Army Chief

h) Lalropui Famhoite - Army Chief

i) John F. Hmar - Information Secretary

4. One congress party worker named Pu Zahunga of Khawlian was gunned by your cadres just before MLA General Election, 2013, was there any specific order to conduct such gunning?

Ans :  We did not targeted anyone in particular. However, we wanted our supported party candidates to win and for that reason I personally stated how I did not mind to reprimand those who stand on our way but without killing them.

5. Who was responsible behind the series of Bomb Explosion (4 times) which occurred between 2013 and 2014 in Aizawl city?

Ans: In late 2013, I met HD Lalhmangaiha, Aizawl at Jeribam and told him to make plans to detonate bombs in Aizawl city without harming innocent civilians. Our motive for this was to make our presence felt and to send a wake-up call to Mizoram government as HPC’D’.

 Later, when he returned, he brought along with him Ringthanga who will be our operative for our mission and we then met at Ankasuah, Manipur. I then took both of them to Kasur valley, HPC’D’ designated camp where we discussed and made plans for our mission. I gave them Rs. 5000 each and further left on their hands the place and time for detonation of bombs.

 To give them proper training, I located Kohkunga (former HPC underground during 1988-1994) from Jeribam who according to HD Lalhmangaiha is an expert in electronic and in making explosive devices. After I located Kohkunga, he and HD Lalhmangaiha and Ringthanga get together but how exactly he had trained them was not known to me. After we are parted, I sent pocket money a few times through private agent (money transfer) but I could not recall the exact amount I had sent them.

6. Some connection seems to have present between your organization and MHWC since HD Lalhmangaiha, the first person you contacted to detonate bombs inside Aizawl was the former OB of MHWC, what exactly is the relationship between Mizoram Hmar Welfare Committee (MHWC) and HPC’D’?

Ans :  Leaders of MHWC are our Political Adviser. However, they do not interfere in all our activities. According to the seriousness of the case, these two MHWC leaders – Pu J. Laldinliana and Pu Lalmuanpuia Punte frequently meet us at Hmarkhawlian or any other convenient places.

 Owing to my health problems, I could not attend much council and PAC meeting. Because of this, I could not be certain whether it was an advice from MHWC that we boycotted the coming VC election.

7. What is the connection between Pu Chaltawnliana, MLA, Manipur state and HPC’D’?

Ans : When the other HPC’D’ faction supported Dr. Lallukhuma who filed nomination for Trinamol Congress party in Tipaimukh constituency, we have no choice but to support Pu Chaltawnliana whom we could consider as Hmar MLA. As far as I know he has been co-operative in any of our requirements. Our relationship with him has been monitored by our higher leaders, the detail of which is not known by me.

8. What is the relationship between HPC’D’ and ‘Hmar Inpui’?

Ans : ‘Hmar Inpui’ was established by us HPC’D’ at the time when Pu Lalhmingthanga Senate was the President. At present, they (‘Hmar Inpui’) could not meet our expectations. Perhaps they could not approve all our activities.

9. What about the relationship between HPC’D’ and HSA Gen. Hqrs. ?

Ans :  As for our movement, HSA Gen. Hqrs. has not been helpful so far. However, as Hmar community, ‘Tuthaphai HSA, Jt. Hqrs. is a real credit for us as they provides free coaching to students, etc.

10. Give us details of weaponry in HPC’D’ arsenal at present?

Ans :  As we are all aware, since Manipur is an insurgency manifested state a large numbers of army personnel are deployed to tackle the situation, some of our weapons are seized by these army personnel while some are used by us to bribed them. Due to these circumstances, I could not give the exact figure right now but as far as I know, our weapons figure at present is as follows-

a) AK 47  - 25-30 Nos.

b) HK - 5 Nos.

c) M-16  - 4-5 Nos.

d) M-16 - 5-6 Nos. (Damaged)

e) US Carbine - 3-4 Nos.

f) SLR - 5 Nos.

g) Shot Gun - 2-3 Nos.

h) Lethod - 1 No.

i) Hand Grenade - 20 Nos. (Approx)

j) Lethod  - 2 Nos. (Damaged)

k) 9 mm Pistol - 12-13 Nos.

l) .32 Pistol - 12-13 Nos.

m) DBBL - 50 Nos. (with license which are keep by civilian)

11. Mention the names of Agents/sympathizers you (HPC’D’) have in Aizawl city?

Ans :  In Aizawl city, they are mainly the leaders of Mizoram Hmar Welfare Committee. We do not have any other who are willing to support us openly. In our operated ares, village leaders are contacted for situation reports before moving from one place to another.

12. Give us your command formations with their In-charge?

Ans :_a) Hmar Bial command._

 Commander - S/S/ Lt. Thangsiama of Vairengte

 2nd I/C - S/S Sgt. Lalchuailova

 _b) Vangai command_

 Commander - S/S Lt. Biakliana of Vairengte

 2nd I/C - S/S Sgt. Kunga of Patpuihmun

 _c) Churachandpur command_

 Commander - S/S/ Lt. Anthony Lalwelcome @ Elkana of Ngampabung

 2nd I/C - S/S Sgt. Jacob of Churachandpur

 Under each command around 15-20 cadres are deployed with about 10 AK 47 rifle each. These figures are not constant as cadres left the movement, some took leave and there are also frequent new recruits.

13. What are the linkages of HPC’D’ with other underground outfits?

Ans :  Apart from those militant outfits under United Peoples Front (UPF) umbrella, we do not have any linkage with other outfits. Several groups under Manipur Peoples Liberation Front approached us which were denied by us.

14. What is the main source of your income?

Ans :  Works were done as Sub-contract under different work agencies who are operating inside our operated areas. Sometimes, donations were also collected, for instance, Rs. 50000 – Rs 70000 from Rs. 10 Lacs worth construction. Along the river Tuiruang, donation were also collected from Bamboo and Timber traders. Apert from these, command I, II, and III also collected taxes from transport vehicles moving inside their respective areas.

15. The incident of Zokhawthiang (on Dt. 28.3.2015) was carried out on whose order? Was it executed on your order?

Ans :  I was aware of that incident only after its completion. However, our council meeting on Dt. 9.4.2015 accepted the incident as our organization’s responsibility. Members of the council who attended the meeting neither expressed their appreciations nor criticisms over this incident but decided to wait for detail reports from our cadres.

 Personally, I was disappointed by that incident. At the same time, it was not suitable to give severe reprimand to our cadres through telephonic call as there is a possibility of forming another faction against us. I therefore decided not to make any comments in favour or against that incident.

 After the incident till today, I haven’t met any of those commanders or cadres who took part in that ambush and I stayed ignorant about the details of that incident.

16. Haven’t your commanders used to take permission from you before they conduct major operations? Did you allow them to operate whichever the way they desire?

Ans : If the operation is planned by us, I told them to inform me before execution. If such major operation at Zokhawthiang was planned, I believe that I or Dy. Army Chief should be given information beforehand. But instead we were kept uninformed.

 It is also possible that our commander at that incident might felt unnecessary to inform me before execution of such plan because during that incident our commanders are considered to have been keeping firing order that can be executed at their will.

17. Who had given order to fire Khawlian BOP on 5th March 2015? Whose plan was it?

Ans : I was informed about our commanders intention to infiltrate into those areas and I even gave advise to be cautious in their operations. However, our commanders did not inform me in advance about the said actual firing of Khawlian BOP. After they returned, I was informed that the firing was done on the way of their withdrawal. I believed that the firing was planned by Commander Thangsiama and commander Biakliana. \

18. Apart from underground group such as UPF, do you have any linkage with any other militant groups?

Ans : I have known Thazuala (Bru militant leader) and we even supplied them arms. When Thazuala was released after his arrest, he requested me to meet him at Hmarkhawlian. I declined his request as they have killed one of our men – Sawma (Bru). I strongly refuse to have any link with him and his organization anymore.

19. Why Norber Sanate and Ngurthantluanga was with you when the police apprehended you at Silchar on Dt. 16.4.2015?

Ans : Personally, Norber Sanate is a close friend of mine. For Our Organisation, he is a trusted and reliable member. Besides, his knowledge of Bangali and Hindi for marketing at Silchar was the main reason.

 Ngurthantluanga doesn’t have any rank in HPC’D’ but he has a good knowledge about machines . As I was intend to buy ‘power tiller’ on that day, I brought him along knowing he would be really useful for my purpose. Beside he is a brother of my sister-in-law.

20. What is the connection between David Buhril, Gen.Secy. Hmar In Pui (Sub Editor-North East Sun) and HPC-D.

Ans : He is a strong protester for our Objection to the construction of Tipaimuk Dam. He Care a lot about the welfare of not only HPC-D but also Hmar community. Arrangement were also done by him when ever talk is to be conducted with Central Government.

20. Is there any agreement for Suspension of Operation between you and Manipur Govt. / India Army ?

Ans : No our SoO with Manipur Govt expired on February 2015. The Manipur Govt. Expressed their willingness to renew this SoO. However, as advised by UDF, we insisted on the knowledge of the central Govt. In this issue. At Present, we are on mutual Understanding.
