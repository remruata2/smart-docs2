No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/884

Dated: 7th December, 2019.

  North East Students' Organization (NESO), the umbrella organization of different Students Unions of the region, held a meeting yesterday, i.e. 6.12.2019 at Guwahati and deliberated on the contentious Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019 (CAB-2019) and resolved to organize 'Total Bandh' in the Northeast region on 10.12.2019 (Tuesday) w.e.f. 5:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. But they exempted Nagaland state since celebration of Hornbill Festival is going on in the state. The meeting expressed their strong resentment on the approval of the CAB-2019 by the Union Cabinet and sent letter to the Hon'ble Prime Minister and Union Home Minister in this regard. In their letter, NESO alleged the Bill as a provision to grant citizenship to all the illegal Bangladeshis who belong to Hindus, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian communities who have entered India till 31st December, 2014. They also stated that the Bill will only encourage more infiltration from Bangladesh which is a big threat to the identity and survival of the indigenous communities of the NE which will further alienate the indigenous people of the NE.

 In pursuance of NESO meeting resolution, MZP Gen. Hqrs. convened Emergency Executive meeting today, i.e. 7.12.2019 @ 12:00 noon at their office under the chairmanship of Pu B. Vanlaltana, President and attended by about 45(forty five) members. The meeting, after due deliberation, resolved to organize the total bandh only in Aizawl City on the same day, i.e. 10.12.2019 w.e.f. 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.

  MZP Gen. Hqrs. issued a Press Release to this effect today and highlighted about their support of NESO in opposing the CAB-2019. The PR expressed their fear of having effect in Mizoram by CAB though the Bill exempted ILP operating states and Sixth Scheduled area. They further stated that unity among the northeastern states is required in opposing CAB and invited all to support their agitation. MZP issued another notice today and alleged Central Government as intending to introduce the CAB-2019 on 9.12.2019 at Lok Sabha and at Rajya Sabha on 10.12.2019 despite strong resentment received from the northeastern region. The notice further stated that MZP do not feel protected on the mere promise of Pu Amit Shah, Hon'ble Union Home Minister regarding provision of exemption from CAB.

 NESO felt that the proposed exemption is an intention to divide the people of the region in opposing the Bill which is detrimental to religious minorities and violate the Constitution of India. Highlighting about the efforts rendered by NESO in general and AASU in particular for Mizoram in the past incidents when Mizoram fight for the continuation of ILP, MZP expressed their commitment to fight not only for Mizoram but also for other Northeastern states also.

 In a notice issued today, MZP Gen. Hqrs. requested headquarters, Sub-Hqrs., branches and other ethnic students' organizations to organize Sit-in-Protest on the same day at their respective jurisdiction in protest against the Bill.

 Information received indicated that MZP is intending to enforce the bandh strictly in Aizawl City. At the same time, since College examination under MZU is over and most of the colleges are about to close for winter vacation, MZP may face difficulty in mobilization of their members and the number of participants in the demonstration might be thinner than other occasions.

 Situation is under close watch.
