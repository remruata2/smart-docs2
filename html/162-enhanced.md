Subject : Threat perception assessment report

Reference : No. MSB/CB/B-19(A)/839 dt. 4.9.2017 

Sir,

Reference to your order letter no. cited above, a comprehensive security threat assessment was conducted and the findings of which is as mentioned below –

1. **Pi Lucy Lalrinthari, District and Sessions Judge, Aizawl**

Pi Lucy Lalrinthari is currently have one PSO which seems quite sufficient for the time being. It is found that at present she does not have any direct threat and no intimidation was made or heard from anyone. However, since Pi Lucy being a female Judge who also have past history of direct threats and intimidations while she was posted at Lunglei, it is felt that providing a PSO or two (if possible) is necessary at all times as she is dealing almost all top sensitive court cases.

1. **Pu K.L. Liana, Presiding Officer, MACT, Aizawl**

Pu K.L. Liana is not having any PSO at present. From an interaction which was recently conducted with him at his office, he himself stated that he had no threat or intimidation of any kind from anyone. As he is a high spirited dedicated religious individual, he affirmed and felt that provision of PSO by the Government was never necessary for him as he feels well protected spiritually. Therefore, providing PSO may not be necessary as he himself feels such is needless.

1. **Pu Vanlalmawia, Addl. District and sessions Judge, Aizawl**

Pu Vanlalmawia is not having PSO at present. A face to face interrogation cannot be conducted with him since he is currently being hospitalized at Kolkata as he is suffering from a Gum-cancer and voice communication cannot be made through phone call as well since he cannot talk or say anything because of his illness. However, assumption was made from collecting information from his colleague, the result of which is as follow- At present, existence of any direct threat or intimidation of any kind from anyone towards Pu Vanlalmawia is not known, most of the cases in his court are also being transferred to other judges as he could not attend his court since the past few months as he continuously needs to take medical treatment for his cancer. So, it is assumed that, since Pu Vanlalmawia who is currently suffering a serious illness seems to have threat of any kind, therefore, considering his present condition, provision of PSO is not recommended as he himself cannot even attend his office for the time being.

  Yours faithfully
