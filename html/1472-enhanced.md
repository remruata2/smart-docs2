****National Security Strategies Conference (NSSC) 2021****

**Day 1**

**Point No. 2 Assessing demographic changes with focus on migration of population away from international border in vulnerable areas and devising cost effective solutions for border management:**

Mizoram sharesinternational border with Myanmar and Bangladesh. It shares 496.531 kms of unfenced international border with Myanmar, and there are around 30 - 40 small villagesscattered in Mizoram side of the Border. It also shares318 Km long international boundary with Bangladesh. These porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh served not only asconvenient routes for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition, to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs, but also for illegal infiltration. The Indo-Myanmar borderis guarded by Assam Rifles and Indo-Bangla border by Border Security Force (BSF).

The porous international border facilitates ease of illegal infiltration into the state from neighbouring countries andillegal migration has the potential to alter the demographic pattern of the border districts adjoining BangladeshIt is alleged that the Chakma population in Mizoram has increased disproportionately or abnormally in the last few years mainly due to illegal infiltration from Bangladesh.The total Chakma population of Mizoram is estimated to be more than 100,000 (as per the 2011 census - 96,972 and 2001 census - 71283). The decadal growth rate of Chakma population is 36.03percentduring 2001 to 2011, which is far way higher than the state decadal growth rate during the same period is 22.78 percent (2001-2011).

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

Southern districts of the state viz. Lawngtlai and Lungleiand Mamit in the western district are more vulnerable to illegal infiltration from Bangladesh. So far,Champhai District having international border with Myanmar has lesser reported cases of illegal infiltration as compared to the above stated districts, but it should not be neglected from the security point of view. A sizeable number of Myanmar nationals are seeking shelter within the state following Military Coup in Myanmar on 1.2.2021 and it should beconstantly monitored and their further movement within the state should also be monitored in order to prevent their further retention within the state.

Suggested Cost Effective solutions for border management:

1. **Beefing Up of Security along international border**:

The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar allow Myanmar’s national to enter up to 16 kms into Mizoram Territory without any VISA restrictions and this may facilitate unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar, if left unchecked. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the Indo-Myanmar and Indo-Bangla border. Regular area domination patrolling should be conducted along the international border.

1. **Expedite Border Fencing work****:**

The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was 344.41 Km. The border fencing work should be expedited in order to prevent illegal infiltration.

1. **Maintaining close cooperation with the people:**

Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar and Indo-Bangla border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be of great assets for the government and the border guard alike.

1. **Maintaining close coordination with counterpart Security Forces****:**

The two border guarding forces viz. Assam Rifles, who are guarding the Indo-Myanmar border and Border Security Force (BSF), who are guarding Indo-Bangla border should try to have close coordination with Myanmar Army and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB)through routine meeting, joint patrolling along the border etc.

1. **Constitution of Border Crime and Security Committee****:**

The Border Crime and Security Committee under the chairmanship of concern District Superintendent of Police and head of border guarding force and other concern departments’ viz. Custom &amp; Excise, Land &amp; Revenue etc.as its members should be constituted. The committee should review the security and crime situation of the international border within the district and meeting should be held regularly,any suggestions/proposal relating to border security/crime should be submitted to Police Headquarters for further submission to the state Home Department for necessary action.

1. **To adopt multi-pronged approach of Border Security**:

In order to seal the Indo-Myanmar and Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government should adopt multi-pronged approach which includes construction of border fencing, floodlighting, setting up of more Border Out Posts (BOPs) along the border, induction of latest surveillance equipments like Hand Held Thermal Imagers (HHTI), Night vision Goggle/Devices, etc.

1. **Setting up of Police Station/Outpost in the bordering villages****:**

Presence of Police Stations/Out Posts in border villages deter trans-border criminals, infiltrators, illegal immigrants and hostile elements from indulging in the activities of intrusion/ encroachment and border law violations.In order to effectivelymanage and prevent cross border crime and law &amp; order situation in the bordering villages, the state government should set-up more civil police stations/outposts in bordering villages, located at a strategic location. The PoliceStations/Outposts could also act as second layer behind the BSF/Border Out Posts (BOPs)/Assam Rifles to keep effective watch on happenings in border villages.

**Day 2**

**Point No. 1****Strategies to deal with the problem of illegal immigrants in the country:**

The long porous international border could be a security threat and migration routes for illegal immigrants to Mizoram. In recent year, it has been reported that**over 2,70,000 (two lakhs seventy thousand) Rohingyas refugees entered Bangladesh through border points of Chittagong Division (Bandarban, Rangamati&Khagrachhari Cox Bazar, etc.). As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division, further infiltration of illegal migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.**

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy and Free Movement Regime (FMR) will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

AMilitary Coup in Myanmarbegan on the morning of 1st February 2021, whendemocratically electedmembers of the country'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy(NLD), were deposed by theTatmadaw (Myanmar Army). A sizeable number of Myanmar nationals flee to the neighbouring countries viz. India, Bangladesh and Thailand due to fear of Military persecution following Military takeover. In this connection, scores of Myanmar nationals are also taking shelter in Mizoram.

****It is necessary to explore the possibilities to tackle and check on growing influx of illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh and Myanmar.

1. **Setting up of Border Management Division****:**

Many states in the country are having a separate Border Management Division and considering the strategic location of the state, it is imperative to set up a separate Border Management Division in the State. The state has border with militant infested Countries viz. Bangladesh and Myanmar, and States viz. Manipur, Tripura and Assam and there have been many instances of seizure of Arms, smuggle items viz. Arms, Drugs etc. and report has been received on many occasions regarding use of the state as transit by various militant groups and there have been alleged reported infiltration of illegal Bangladeshi in southern districts of the state. A separate Border Management Division under Home Department/ Police Headquarters should be set up, which will specialize in managing the border.

1. **Cross Border Deliveryby Pregnant Women**_:_

 There have been reported instances in the southern districts of Mizoram that many pregnant women from Bangladesh enter the state on the pretext of seeking medical assistance and giving birth due to poor medical facilities in their area. As the new born baby has to be registered by the Hospital, they can easily get citizenship status of the country by birth. The matter has to be dealt carefully as it can be security threat for facilitating illegal infiltration and compromise Citizenship status in the Country.

1. **Setting Up of Immigration Check Post****:**

 Special attention should be given to districts having international border viz. Mamit District, Champhai District,Lunglei District,Hnahthial, Saitual, Serchhip, Lawngtlai District and Siaha District. The State is conduit for illegal migration due to its long porous international border and ethnicity linked with the bordering countries. The Chakmas/Brus community dominated areas in the southern and western part of the state should be given more focus in respect of illegal infiltration due to its reported abnormal growth rate. Immigration Check Post should be set up in areas which are vulnerable for illegal infiltration. The Immigration Check Post should be set up under the supervision and control of concern District Superintendent of Police. A proper report should be maintained at the Immigration Check Post.

1. **Strengthening of Task Force specially constituted to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram &deportation:**

In order to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram and for their deportation, 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District. These Special Task Forces should be reinforced by making separate budgetary provision, routine meeting etc. for their effective functioning.
