Subject:  Comments on Initiative towards ‘ SMART Policing’.

Reference: No.PA/DIG(CID)/MISC/2015/306 dt.10.12.2015.

Sir,

  With reference to your letter no and the subject cited above, I am hereby submitting my comments on the following recommendations of Task Force on National Security (TFNS) pertaining to Bangladesh.

| **Para** **No.** | **Text of Recommendations in TFNS report** | **Comments/Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4.072 (a) | What needs watching is the coming and settling down of illegal immigrants in villages near the border and growth of buildings for religious worship. This is a cause of local tensions and a concern for internal security.  | **(i) In order to detect and deport settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram , 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Saiha District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.**  **(ii) Mizoram Police have so far arrested 59 Bangladesh nationals illegally entering Mizoram during the last eight year i.e 2008-2015(till November,2015)**  |
|  | There is need for creation and upgradation of infrastructure for facilitating trade at popular locations on the border. Such infrastructure should included a network of roads, rail links where cost-effective and well equipped Integrated Check Posts(ICPs) with good warehouse facilities, state of the art X-ray machines etc are available. The road blocks at Raxaul, for example, do not help project the right image. |  **Department of Trade & Commerce, Government of Mizoram had already submitted proposal to Central Government for development of Integrated Check Posts (ICP) in Kawrpuichhuah (Tlabung), Lunglei District near Indo-Bangla border.** |
| 4.077 (a) |  The Task Force feels that the feasibility of a "work permit" scheme for Bangladeshi nationals may be examined by the Centre in consultation with the affected States. Such migration for economic reasons is a global phenomenon and a somewhat liberal approach might have to be adopted. The issue of work permit has been discussed many times in Government and the Task particularly with the improvement of relations with the new regime in Bangladesh to introduce a longer lasting system of work permits for Bangladesh nationals coming to work in India. |  **Employment Visas are issued to foreigners who are working in India. As per the record of the office of CID(SB) i.e Foreigner Registration Officer(FRO), in Mizoram as of 11.12.2015 only one Bangladeshi national namely Md.Amjad Hussain is working in the state of Mizoram as project consultancy services for construction of Serchhip to Buarpui Project-2 Road by Public Work Department(PWD), Mizoram .The Project is funded by Asian Development Bank.** |
| 4.077 (b) | An inter-ministerial group may be constituted to study the Implications of this system in co-operation with the State Governments bordering Bangladesh and other states with major metropolitan cities where Bangladeshis have migrated in substantial numbers.  | **On 22. January, 2015, An Indo-Bangladesh Border meeting was held at the border town of Mamit, Mamit District. The meeting discussed issues like illegal infiltration, abduction by insurgent groups hiding in Bangladesh. The meeting was attended by Deputy Commissioners and Superintendents of Police of Mamit, Lunglei and Lawngtlai districts, Commandants of two BSF battalions, senior officials from the Revenue and Trade and Commerce departments, while the Bangladeshi delegation comprised of Deputy Commissioners and SPs of Rangamati and Bandarban, Director of 25 Border Guard battalion and other senior officials.** **A similar meeting of Indo-Bangla DC/DM Level Meeting was held on 25th Nov, 2015 at Chittagong Bangladesh. The meeting discussed issues like illegal infiltration, smuggling, abduction by insurgent groups hiding in Bangladesh. The meeting was attended from Mizoram side by Deputy Commissioners of Lungei and Mamit Districts and Superintendents of Police of Mamit, Lunglei and Lawngtlai districts. While the Bangladeshi deligations comprised of Deputy Commissioners and SPs of Rangamati and Bandarban, and officers from Border Guards of Bangladesh(BGB)** **** |
| _4.078_ _(a)_ | Illegal migration is significantly altering the demographic pattern of the border districts adjoining Bangladesh. While our general approach has been to improve the front line of the Border Security Force(BSF). It is also necessary that the State Governments be given assistance by the Centre to set-up civil police stations which could act as second layer behind the BSF/Border Out Posts(BOPs) to keep effective watch on happenings in border villages.  |  **It may be mentioned that Mizoram (India) and neighbouring Bangladesh share a long unfenced border. This makes the border extremely porous coupled with the hilly and inhospitable terrain. The existing deployment of Border Guarding (BG) forces is inadequate to effectively check the activities of various Indian Insurgent Groups (IIGs) who used this border for transit of smuggled weapons, drugs and also for cross-border movement for seeking safe refuge and training in their hideout in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh.**  **Mizoram Police separately deployed security personnel(IR Bn) along Indo-Bangla border and the expenditure incurred for performing such security duties were borned by the state government.**  ******It is therefore requested that some discretionary component may be introduced under Security Related Expenditure(SRE) by Central Government****so that states of Mizoram could acts as effective layer behind Central Paramilitary Forces for safeguarding the territory of India.** **** |


Yours faithfully,
