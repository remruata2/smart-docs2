 The system of transporting the girls as per version of the driver is so controversial which raised suspicion and the girls alongwith the driver are taken to Vairengte Police Station.

 On the morning of 24.4.2019, the girls were examined through interpreter as they spoke Rohingya language which is Eastern Indo-Aryan language similar to Bengali to some extent.

 Toyaba(22) D/o Soyid Salam, the eldest one stated that all of them are refugee from Myanmar and resided at Kutupalong refugee camp, Bangladesh. Sometime about 5 months ago, Nurkayas and Toyaba both residents of the same camp who used to talk Anamal Hussain who live in Malaysia enticed them to go to Malaysia through India and his brother will find suitable jobs for them. At first, they declined this offer but as the two men promised prosperous future and as their living condition in Bangladesh is so poor, the eight of them agreed to go to Malaysia.

 She and her sister Rubina left the camp on 17.4.2019 and when they reached Silchar, the six other girls were already available at the house, the area and owner they did not know.

On the 23rd April, 2019 evening, they were taken to MM Sumo counter, Silchar from where they boarded the Sumo. When they reached Police Check Gate, they were intercepted and taken to Police Station.
