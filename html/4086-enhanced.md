Sir,

****In compliance with your letter No. mentioned above, assessment of threat perception in respect of MP candidates for the Mizoram GPE-2024 were conducted. After conducting threat assessment perception, it has been found that the threat perceived either direct or indirect against all the MP candidates are minimal. As such, it is concluded that 1(one) PSO each for the MP candidates will be sufficient at the moment.

 Submitted for kind perusal and further necessary action, please.

Yours faithfully,
