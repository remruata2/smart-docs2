Around 15 students were placed outside Aijal Club immediately after the meeting by ICFAISAC who, however, dispersed @ 11:30 p.m. without any untoward incident.

 ICFAI students started gathering in front of Aijal Club today, i.e. 09.05.2019 @ 9:20 a.m. and their demonstration started @ 10:40 a.m. after they came to know that the Chancellor had already left Aijal Club; he was reported to have left in the wee hours of the morning for Lengpui. Around 350 students and employees were present in the demonstration which was presided over by Jeho Lalrinhlua, Fin. Secy, ICFAISAC and Lalhruaitluanga, Secretary, ICFAISAC gave a report on the actions they have taken so far in pursuance of their demands. C.Hmingsangzuala, from Employees Forum, delivered a speech stating the inability of ICFAI Society, Hyderabad to address the problems of poor facilities, exorbitant fees etc. in the University, which he claimed was established by an Act passed in the Mizoram Legislative Assembly, had finally resulted in the present precarious situation. Lalnunpuia, President, ICFAISAC also addressed the demonstrators condemning the act of the Chancellor for returning from Aizawl without bringing about any solution to the problems. The demonstrators shouted out slogans and carried/displayed placards with slogans such as; 1) Mizoram Government should fulfil its responsibility on us 2) We don’t want ICFAI Society who are unable to take care of us 3) Exorbitant fees- a bane for us.

 Around 30 leaders of ICFAISAC headed by their President, Lalnunpuia held a Press Conference at Aizawl Press Club @ 1:30 p.m. which was attended by around 15 media persons. Highlighting the different problems befalling the University, he stated that though the Chancellor agreed to most of their demands he could not consider the reduction of fees, their main bone of contention, resulting in failure to find a common ground. He also blamed the Government for failure to do its part adding that their immediate course of action will be to meet the Hon’ble Chief Minister to discuss the issue and how to address it.

 After the Press Conference the leaders went to Chief Minister’s Office, Zarkawt to make an appointment for a meeting with the Hon’ble Chief Minister at the earliest. It has been reported that they will suspend their agitation till the meeting with the Hon’ble Chief Minister and classes will also resume as normal till then.
