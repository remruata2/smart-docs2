****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/779

Dated: 16th October, 2019.

 A meeting between MHA Officials including officials from Governments of Mizoram and Tripura and various Bru NGOs was held in Agartala today, i.e. 16.10.2019 to deliberate on the current impasse over Bru refugee repatriation. The Bru NGOs were learnt to be persistent with their demands as a result of which there could be no positive outcome. In the meantime, input suggests a certain NGO had been actively instigating Bru communities to rise against the repatriation plan. Input suggests that Brus may resort to further agitation with exasperation on Government’s stoppage of free ration.
