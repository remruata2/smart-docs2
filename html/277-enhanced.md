Subject : Report on Assessment of threat perception

Reference : No. MSB/CB/B-19(A) 07/06 Dated 5th Jan. 2016

Sir,

 With reference to the above mentioned subject and letter number, enquiry was conducted and the reports of my findings are as under.

 Careful investigation on the possibilities of threat against Chief Engineer Project Pushpak (BRTF), who are undergoing maintaining works of Sairang to Tuipubari road, from underground elements, was conducted.

 It seems that BRTF personnel are reluctant to deploy themselves in the area without the protection of police security. It may be noted that, ever since the kidnapping and released of Deep Mandal way back in March 2014, no activities like threats and demands from any Bru militants, NLFT nor Chakma militants were reported against civilians and BRTF personnel inside Mizoram.

  No information regarding any intention of conducting kidnapping or intimidation against anyone by militants operating in these areas in the near future has been received. Even the O/C of BRTF and his staff have not received any threat or demand since 2014, verbally or in writings. At the same time, if there are local miscreants, who, taking advantages of the situation and imitating the militants are making threats, it will be a different question. At the moment, there is no information of any militants within Mizoram state or from neighbouring Bangladesh planning any activities inside Mizoram. At the moment, according to reports from OC/JE BRTF and SDPO, West Phaileng, works is in progress by BRTF on these roads without any police escort and faced no disturbances or problems.

 Considering the above situation, it appears unnecessary to provide police protection to all the BRTF personnel who are conducting these roads maintaining works. However, as a precautionary measure and to boost morale, instructions may be given to police and BSF personnel to be extra alert if they are posted in the vicinity. Monitoring of movements and activities of underground elements operating in these areas are under close watch round the clock and collection of detailed information is also being done.

 Yours faithfully
