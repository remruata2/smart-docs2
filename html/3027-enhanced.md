Dated: 12th September, 2019.

 Information has been received that Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples Forum (MBDPF) convened a joint meeting with leaders of other Bru NGOs on 10.9.2019 @ 7:00 a.m at Naisingpara Relief Camp, Tripura which was chaired by Pu A. Sawibunga, President, MBDPF and attended by about 40 (forty) members. The following leaders apprised the outcome of the JMG Meeting held on 6.9.2019 at New Delhi :-

1. Pu Bruno Msha, Gen. Secretary, MBDPF
2. Pu Lalbiakthanga, President, MBDPF Branch, Kaiskau
3. Govinda, Teacher, Naisingpara SSA School

 They apprised the meeting that the JMG Meeting resolved to commence the repatriation latest by 1.10.2019 as per the Road Map of the agreement which was already signed on 3.7.2018. The joint meeting deliberated about their dissatisfaction upon the non-consideration of their demands and the instruction of the JMG Meeting Chairman to commence the repatriation w.e.f. 1.10.2019, ignoring the State Government’s appeal requesting to postpone the repatriation for at least one or two weeks.

 In the meeting, they expressed their dissatisfaction on the failure of their various demands. Majority of them disapproved the instruction to commence the repatriation on 1.10.2019.

 In the meantime, input indicated that leaders of Mizoram Bru Displaced People Coordination Committee (MBDPCC) and Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement (MBIDM) had instigated the inmates of the relief camps to oppose the repatriation. They are conducting a drive by collecting the list of those agreeing and disagreeing the repatriation. They are continuing their demand for Autonomous District Council (ADC) besides other demands which they already submitted. MBIDM and Bru Tribal Development Society (BDTS) led by Bipin Kumar are still continuing their campaign for ADC among the Brus. Information received indicated that due to the above stated reasons and non-consideration of their demands, Bru people are likely to oppose the upcoming repatriation process scheduled to be conducted from 1.10.2019.

 Further information received indicated that MBDPCC is intending to issue a Press Release to express their dissatisfaction on non-implementation of their demands, non-inclusion of some refugees during the identification, and neglect of inmates of Nobojoy Camp.

 In the meantime, leaders of MBDPF are planning to visit Mizoram shortly aiming to implore the State Government to implement at least some of their demands though the JMG Meeting strongly instructed to commence the repatriation w.e.f. 1.10.2019.
