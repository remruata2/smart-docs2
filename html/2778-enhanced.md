Dated: 21st May, 2021

 As per input, Dobe-a (Dopha Reang), s/s Commander of NLFT (PD), gave an instruction from Zopui, Bangladesh through mobile phone to one of their outfit member Sadhu Reang, instructing him to contact their Bru friends of Assam. As per his instruction, Sadhu Reang contacted Brega Reang of Kutkuti village, Hailakandi District, Assam, who is a member of United Democratic Liberation Army (Bru insurgent group) led by Doinoram Reang, and informed him that NLFT (PD) is inclined to abduct an engineer working under company carrying out works at Mizoram-Bangladesh border area as the outfit is facing financial crisis. However, as they lacked necessary experience to carry out abduction, he requested him to come to Zopui, Bangladesh along with his friends and to assist them in abducting company worker/engineer for ransom. The above conversation took place yesterday, i.e., 20.5.2021 and early morning of today, i.e., 21.5.2021.

 At this juncture, Brega Reang has not informed Sadhu Reang about their decision in this regard, but it is learnt that he has informed some members of UDLA present at Hailkandi District, Assam and their final decision is not known as of now. It is also learnt that Dopha Reang has recently recruited some persons of Thangnang and Zopui villages of Bangladesh into NLFT (PD) and the present strength of the outfit is around 70 (seventy).

 At present, border fencing work along Mizoram-Bangladesh border is undertaken by RATNA Infrastructure Ltd. having its base at Lengpui and Rajiv Nagar to West Kawnpui (Zomuantlang) road construction work is taken up by Pu Chalngura Zahau.
