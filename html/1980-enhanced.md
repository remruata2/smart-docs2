**BRIEF HISTORY:**

 My particulars are as mentioned above. I was born on 25th May, 1991and spent my childhood in Bethany village, Kolasib District. In 1997 or 1998, my family shifted to Naisingpara Refugee Camp where we settled till date.

 In the early 2013, I met Lalduhawma of Naisingpara who invited me to join the undergroud. I had no job, I worked as a casual labour where I can, so I thought that it was the right thing to do for my Clan. I followed Lalduhawma to Bangladesh to join Bru Underground (BDFM). On reaching Bangladesh, we joined the camp of one Mizoram Bru underground (Salkha Party). I did not get any training as I had expected but was assigned to work in the fields.

 Our camp was situated 1 kilometres from Zopui village. As far as I know, Sektapha (overground agent), Odhi (SS Private) and Orjungpha (SS Private) were ther in the camp but I doubt if they have firearms.

 On November 2013, our superiors sent us to take rice from the village but at Thangnang village, NLFT's were waiting for us and under their guidance we entered Mizoram. Us Bru's were led by Duhawma and the NLFT's were Kormo, Lokhibong, Sudon, Wareng, Raichad and one other guy whose name I don't know.

 After leaving Thangnang, between Tuipuibari and Damparengpui, we went through one huge gate which was said to be Forest Gate. After going on for a while, the NLFT's hid those of us who were carrying goods (rice and pots) on top of a hill. They went down and hid on the roadside and stopped one approaching vehicle, kidnapping the three occupants of the vehicle. After this, we spent two nights in a ravine near the place of kidnapping. We moved on to Lungtian, Bangladesh and Torungpara where we stayed for about a week. From Torungpara, we shifted to a nearby ravine and then stayed in a field for three days at Bolantia, Bangladesh. We then stayed in a ravine at Torungpara till we came out.

 Aside from this kidnapping, I was never involved in any other crime as I was assigned to work in the fields.

 On June 2014, I ran out from the camp as I could not bear it anymore and joined my family at Naisingpara. I got a phone call from Thlamuana who assured me that he would help me dissolve my Case if I followed him, and so I did and was arrested.
