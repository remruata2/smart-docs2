_*__The Notification issued by Government of Mizoram with regard to appointment and extension of the term of Interim Sinlung Hills Council (SHC) vide No.B.12012/1/2018-GAD(SHC) Dated 18.1.2019 has evoked much criticism from HPC(D) and amongst Hmar community as well since the newly appointed members allegedly included names of former HPC/SHDC leaders and MNF workers while dropping others who they claimed were integral to the party responsible for the signing of Memorandum of Settlement (MoS). Input received indicated that the 3 (three) appointed SHC members, namely, Lalthlamuana Hmar, Chief Executive Member, Lalbiaknunga, Deputy Chairman and Ms. Melody Lalchhuangzeli, Executive Member representing HPC(D) may be asked to decline their appointment pending decision by the HPC(D) high command whose intended meeting had been stalled due to Total Bandh called by Young Paite Association in Churachandpur on 22.1.2019. Input indicates further that Lalthlamuana Hmar, who is appointed as CEM, seemed prepared to accept rather than decline, albeit the HPC(D) high command’s pending decision._

_* Executive Committee meeting of the Ex-Hmar Volunteer Association (HPC) held on 23.1.2019 at Sakawrdai had adopted a resolution criticising the Government of Mizoram for extending the interim period of Sinlung Hills Council (SHC) and expressed their disapproval of the newly appointed members of the Council describing it as a total disregard of the Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) signed between the State Government and the HPC(D). The Association demanded the State Government to respect the MoS and to rescind its appointment order immediately. In the meantime, the Ex-HVA (HPC) also appealed the appointed members to decline the appointment._
