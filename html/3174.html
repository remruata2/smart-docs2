The DIG has also mentioned that most of the motor accidents in Mizoram in the last two years occurred between 12 noon and 6:00pm. Given that most of the two wheeler drivers used to indulge in drunken driving in the evening, for which most of the accidents had indeed occurred, a surprise checking may need to be carried out. And, Zero Tolerance may also be carried out not only throughout a week, but may be even for a month, the DIG added. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
