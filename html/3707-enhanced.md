Points: 9.2(iii) Myanmar Refugee Issue :

 Mizoram shares 496.531 kms. of porous International border with Myanmar as per the record of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram. The Indo-Myanmar border posts are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

 Military takeover took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 whendemocratically electedmembers ofMyanmar'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy, were deposed by Myanmar's Military.

 The escalating resistance put up against the military regime by Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) definitely had an impact and permeate the Indo Myanmar boundary, which resulted in influx of a considerable number of refugees arriving and taking shelter in Mizoram and Manipur. Input received stated that CRPH and CDM supporters are adamant and determined to continue their resistance which had shown a new level including armed resistance for their personnel defence.

 Many Myanmar refugees presently took shelter in various districts of Mizoram following military coup in Myanmar. These refugees are accommodated in their relatives houses and makeshift camps set up by NGOs.

 According to information received, makeshift camps for Myanmar Refugees were constructed at Zawlsei, Vaphai, Farkawn and Chawngtui in Champhai District by their respective NGOs. In Hnahthial District, makeshift camp for refugees were constructed at Thingsai, Bualpui 'H', New Ngharchhip and Cherhlun by respective NGOs.

 The district wise details of Myanmar refugees, as per this office records, are indicated in the following table (as on 24.4.2023):

|  **Sl.No** | **District** | **Total numbers of Refugees** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Aizawl | 3306 |
| 2. | Lunglei | 1807 |
| 3. | Champhai | 10226 |
| 4. | Lawngtlai | 5900 |
| 5. | Siaha | 7872 |
| 6. | Hnahthial | 1142 |
| 7. | Serchhip | 509 |
| 8. | Kolasib | 215 |
| 9. | Saitual | 125 |
| 10. | Khawzawl | 190 |
| 11. | Mamit | 356 |
| **TOTAL -** |  | **31,648** |


 These figures are compiled from the daily information received the various sectors officers posted in different parts of the states. It may also be mentioned that the above figures are prone to fluctuations as the refugees themselves did not settled down permanently. In other words, they often moved up and down across the border due to certain reasons such as financial reasons, family affairs etc.

 Another consequence of the escalating situation of Myanmar is the increase in the amount of narcotics smuggled across the border. The reason for these increase may be attributed to the decline in the numbers of military check gates on the Myanmar side or to the refugees themselves acting as a peddlers. To counter these menace, CID(SB) has been taking great efforts and below is given a table showing the amount of seizure of narcotics substances during the last two years -

****Seizure of narcotic substances during the period between 1.1.2021 -31.3 2023****

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sl No | Drugs seized | Quantities(approx.) | Value (approx.) |
| 2. | **Methamphetamine** | 118.493 Kgs | Rs. 289,810,000 |
| **Total** |  |  | **Rs. 130,100,000** |


Points 19.7(II) Strengthening of Security and Intelligent Network along Mizoram - Myanmar border:

 According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of unfenced International border with Myanmar, which are scattered around 30 - 40 small villages in Mizoram side. These International border posts with Myanmar are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

 To strengthened the securities and intelligence network along these Mizoram - Myanmar borders areas, apart from existing Sector offices, Special Branch has created new Sector offices recently in Hnahthial and Zokhawthar on 22.6.2022 and 23.3.2023 respectively.

Points: 19.7(iii) - Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agencies and Intelligence agencies about Rohingyas Crisis and its security implication :

 The persecution of Myanmar's Rohingyas Muslim dates back to at least the 1970s. Since then, the Rohingyas people have been persecuted on a regular basis by government and Buddhist nationalists. The Rohingyas crisis has deepened due to the (25th August, 2017) violent acts of the Muslim insurgent group acting under the banner of Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). The subsequent offensive operation launched by Myanmar Army against this Muslim insurgents resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and exodus of waves of Rohingyas from Rakhine State, Myanmar into the neighbouring Bangladesh.

 To ascertain the actual number of Rohingyas present in Mizoram and any new entry, if there is any, CID (SB) has been regularly instructing all its field staffs stationed in different parts of Mizoram to check any illegal infiltration of Rohingyas in different parts of Mizoram .

 Apart from this, information of various types are often shared by this unit with other sister agencies operating in the state through SMAC and LIA meetings.
