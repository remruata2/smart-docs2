Sir,

 In response to your letter no. mentioned above, discreet enquiry to verify whether 'Sikh For Justice' Organisation exists in Mizoram or not was conducted.

 During the course of this enquiry, interaction with several non mizo community members were conducted who inturn expressed that they have no knowledge about the existence of such group in Mizoram. Further, reliable information indicated that the total number of Sikh Community members present in Mizoram is very less for such organisation to operate in the state.

 Yours faithfully,
