Sir,

  With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, threat assessment in respect of MLA and Candidate of Chalfilh Constituency Dr.H.Ngurdingliana had been conducted and ascertained that one of the HPC(D) factions led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate intended to disturb him during his tour of election campaign.
