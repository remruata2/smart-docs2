 With reference to the subject cited above, I am to state that discreet enquiry was conducted on Mizo Youth Service Corp. (MYSC) regarding the kidnapping of Aklas Uddin of Banga Bazar, Karimganj alleged to have involved in smuggling of Pseudoephedrine. Witnesses and the kidnappers were examined and the findings are stated below:

1. Two kidnappers namely, Thomson Lalrambuatsaiha and Mickey C.Zohmingliana said that they had no idea who Aklas Uddin was and whether he was involved or not in Pseudoephedrine smuggling. They acted on the plan of Robert Lalmuanpuia, the mastermind of the kidnapping. Robert Lalmuanpuia himself also said that he did not know whether Aklas Uddin smuggled Pseudoephedrine or not, they kidnapped him purely for monetary reason. Robert Lalmuanpuia further said that they intended to kidnap a certain man whose flight was cancelled on that day, so, Aklas Uddin was kidnapped instead. They kidnapped Aklas Uddin to make their activities known/aware by public.

2. Aklas Uddin has 5 (five) brothers and 3 (three) sisters and they live at Banga Bazar, Karimganj District, Cachar, Assam. Their family business is selling betelnut and have been supplying betelnut to Aizawl for 15 (fifteen) years. They collect betelnut in their hometown and neighbouring villages and supply to Mizoram with a profit of Rs. 20,000/- to Rs. 30,000/- per month. The family is not known to be involved in other business other than betelnut business. Traders near the shop of Aklas Uddin at New Market in the street of Power House also confirmed this.

3.  The owner of Aklas Uddin's rented house at Babutlang, Zarkawt also said that he did not suspect Aklas Uddin to have involved in smuggling of Pseudoephedrine.

 Based on the findings and statements of people who were acquainted with Aklas Uddin, it is strongly assumed that he is not involved in Pseudoephedrine smuggling and that the accused/kidnappers just made it up to save their faces as they did not succeed in squeezing money from the victim-Aklas Uddin.

 This is for your kind information.
