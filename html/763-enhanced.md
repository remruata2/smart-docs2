****History****

By 1935Christianityhad taken over most of the traditional Mizo lifestyle, formal education system had been introduced,British rulewas about to be revoked and local administration was to be subjected to Indian politics. The basictribal administrativesystemZawlbukwas dissolving. The traditional social security, custom and training ground for young men was coming to an end, thereby necessitating a substitute of the tribal institution urgently. As serendipity would have it, athunderstormon the Monday evening of 3 June 1935, right after worship service, drove the Welsh missionaries and the Mizo church leaders to the nearby residence of Miss Kattie Hughes (known to Mizos as Pi Zaii), at Aijal (nowAizawl), wherein they made an impromptu proposal over a cup of tea for establishing an association that would unite all the Mizo people. As a Christian gathering, the initial proposed name was_Young Mizo Christian Association_, to rhyme withYoung Men's Christian Association (YMCA), which on scrutiny they noticed had a restrictive and religiousfundamentalistconnotation. Then Rev David Edward (Zorema Pa) came up with "Young Lushai Association" akin to their familiarYoung Wales AssociationinWales. The name was unanimously accepted. It was also agreed that the association would be formally inaugurated on the coming 15 June.

Though how many people and who were present on that night could not be ascertained, the following people were present:

1. Rev David Edward
2. Upa D. á¹¬hianga
3. Rev L. Evans
4. Upa Chawngzika
5. Miss Kattie Hughes
6. Pu Muka
7. Rev Chhuahkhama
8. Pu Vankhuma
9. Pu L. Kailuia
10. Pu L.H. Liana
11. Upa Ch. Pasena

YLA was unveiled on 5 June 1935 at the grand public meeting at Nepali School, Sikulpuikawn, with a candle lighting ceremony and election of the officials. Branches were soon created in every village, and all Mizo of age were soon registered members. The advent ofIndian Independenceincited new political and ethnic identity revivals in Mizoram (Lushai Hills, as it was called). For democratic administrative system, apolitical partywas need. As the only and most endorsed organisation, YLA itself was suggested in 1945 to be the first political party. But the central committee objected to it, and this prompted the creation of an entirely political party, theMizo Union. Then the terminology "Mizo" began to have new revolutionary meaning, it had much more inclusive and panoramic implications than "Lushai", which in any case was the Welshs'misnomerfor "Lusei", a majorclanof the Mizo tribe. Consequently, the central YLA committee resolved to change YLA to "Young Mizo Association" (YMA) on 7 October 1947.
