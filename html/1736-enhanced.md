****BRU MILITANCY****

1.Since 1997, a group of Brus youth took up arms and started demanding a separate Autonomous District Council for the Brus residing in Mizoram and formed an armed group to support their demand. This armed group threatened the Brus of Mizoram to flee Mizoram.

2.The fleeing Brus from Mizoram were designated to various refugee camps in Tripura. Inspite of an all out effort made by the Central Government and Mizoram Government to repatriate these Bru refugees, it appears that they still feel insecure against the Mizo communities and they are still reluctant to return to Mizoram.

 3.Different armed groups of the Brus- Bru National Army(BRA), Bru National Liberation Front or Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram(BLFM) are not active anymore.

However, a new group Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM) was again formed recently under the patronage of NLFT.

4.The BDFM cadres are mainly responsible for the heinous crimes which occurred in the western border areas of Mizoram during the recent past which included kidnapping for ransom, burglary of Government offices, etc
