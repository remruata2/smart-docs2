**HC MALSAWMKIMA**

 In the aftermath of the recent ambush by HPC-D elements at Zokhawthiang (Kani), Mizoram on 28.3.2015 wherein three (3) Mizoram Police personnel including O/C Sakawrdai PS were killed and six others injured, the Operational Teams of Mizoram Police have been patrolling the area of Mizoram bordering Manipur, to prevent recurrence of another incident and to apprehend the accused of this ambush who were repeatedly visiting the villages in this area of Mizoram, threatening the villagers, extorting money, intimidating candidates of the recent Village Council Elections within the entire HPC-D affected area of Mizoram.

 On the night of 7.5.2015, the Operational Party which was patrolling the area of Mizoram bordering Manipur received specific information that the main persons accused in the ambush, who were wanted in FIR No.6/15 dated 29/3/2015 u/s 302/307/396/397/120(B)/326 IPC r/w 25(1A)/27(B) Arms Act of Sakawrdai PS, were hiding in Tiaulian village of Manipur, just across the border. The information was very specific and the accused would have slipped away, therefore, Operation Team decided to verify the information and approached Tiaulian village, early on the morning of 8.5.2015 at the break of dawn. On seeing the approaching Police party, some persons started running and were asked to stop. Instead of stopping, these persons started unprovoked firing on the Police party who had no option but to return fire in self-defense. One of the attackers was hit by the defensive fire while others managed to escape. The attacker, who was hit, succumbed to his injuries and was identified as deserter Constable H.C. Malsawmkima of Mizoram Police who had deserted along with two service weapons and ammunitions of Mizoram Police on 11.7.2014 and joined HPC-D. The deceased has also been identified as one of the main accused in the ambush of 28.3.2015.
