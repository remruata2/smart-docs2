****Assessment of threat perception in view of the scheduled visit of Aizawl by Hon'ble President Smt.Droupadi Murmu****

 Assessment of threat perception in view of the scheduled visit of Aizawl by Hon'ble President Smt.Droupadi Murmu was conducted and during the course of threat assessment, sources and contacts, links and informants from insurgent groups having operating area adjoining to the interstate and international border were contacted besides constantly monitoring their activities and movements. Despite the existence and presence of several insurgent groups having base and operating areas alongside interstate and international border, it is learnt that at this moment none of these underground insurgents pose any threat to disrupt or thwart the scheduled programme of the Hon'ble President during her stay in Aizawl. It is also further learnt that the threat perceived by the Hon'ble President from insurgent groups is minimal at the moment. Impending issues undertaken by NGOs, student bodies, civil society organisation were also taken into account.

 It is concluded that the threat perceived by the Hon'ble President Smt.Droupadi Murmu from insurgent groups, NGOs, student bodies, civil society organisations, political rivalry or even from personal animosity as well as the venues associated with her visit is considered minimal at the moment.
