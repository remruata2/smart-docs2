 **The Under Secretary**

**Government of Mizoram**

**Home Department**

**Subject: **Threat Perception Assessment of Pu Lalrobiaka, MLA and Chairman, ZIDCO, Mizoram for issue of prohibited Bore Arm Licence.****

Ref. : **No. L.14012/1(AIZAWL)/2014-HMA dt. 24.11.2015**

Sir,

** **With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, I am submitting herewith threat perception assessment report in respect of Pu Lalrobiaka, MLA and Chairman of ZIDCO, Mizoram for further necessary action.****

 Hachhek Constituency, the westernmost constituency of Mamit District is adjacent to militant infested district of Assam, Hailakandi, Karimganj District as well as Tripura North District. The uprising of Bru militancy since 1997 made the people of this constituency Border States frequented this constituency on many occasions. The brutal murder of Lalzawmliana, Game Watcher of Forest Department in 1997, kidnapping of Government officials and civilians and the recent brutal murder of Zarzokima of Bungthuam are some of the glaring evidences of the vulnerability of this constituency.

 It may not be out of place to mention here that on the very day of the murder of Zarzokima, the Hon'ble Parliamentary Secretary; Pu Lalrinmawia Ralte and his entourage were on official visit to Kanhmun and the unfortunate incident occurred just before they crossed the spot. Subsequent enquiry and confession of the arrested militant members revealed that the first target was not the victim, Zarzokima, but the MLA and his party on their way home from official tour.

 The 1,000 plus strong Bru refugees are being repatriated from Tripura refugee camp to Mizoram and a larger number of refugees are yet to be repatriated. There are some radical groups who steadfastly opposed to repatriation of these refugees and even instigated some Bru armed group to use any means to derail the smooth process of repatriation. As the Government of Mizoram and the Government of India are determined to complete repatriation process at the earliest, the constituency MLA, who is also looking after Home Department as Parliamentary Secretary, is promptly taking his responsibilities assigned to him. The anti-repatriation group and some militant outfits targeted him as their enemy number one for whom his security is a matter of great concern until and unless anti-repatriation activities and militant outfits supporting them are finished. Being a politician and a constituency MLA, touring his constituency and supervision of various development works being carried out by the Government for the people of this constituency including remote areas has to be done by him frequently and, he has to do his duties and responsibilities even at the risk of his own security in various vulnerable points.

 In view of the above few points mentioned, the security and threat perception of the said MLA could not be taken lightly and fool proof security or escorts be provided to him whenever he is on official tour to his constituency. It is further recommended that, reliable personal weapon with effective fire power nay also be provided to him for self defense and for any eventuality that may cause risks to security of his life.

 Some of the key posts being held by the MLA are listed as under:-

1. MLA, Hachhek Constituency, Mizoram and Parliamentary Secretary, Home, RD, etc. Government of Mizoram.

2. Member, All India Congress Committee.

3. Secretary, Congress Legislative Party, Mizoram.

4. Chairman, Rajiv Gandhi Panchayati Raj Sangathan, Mizoram State.

5. Member, State Security Commission.

6. Secretary, Manifesto Drafting Committee, MPCC.

Yours faithfully,
