**Relief camp of Thingsai village facing problems:******One of the relief camps established for Myanmar refugees in Mizoram, the relief camp at Thingsai village, Hnahthial District is assumed to accommodate the highest numbers of refugees in Mizoram. Presently, there are 356 refugees from 57 families in this camp.

 According to leaders of Thingsai villages, they have started exhausting thefunds received as donations from voluntary organisations, Churches and willing donors and they are likely to face problems in feeding these refugees. After a gap of every three weeks, a total of 30 bags of rice were being distributed to these refugees, which is around 7 kg. per head, for the past one year, the latest being three weeks back. They are now running out of their stock of rice and are unable to continue their distribution as the remaining twelve bags are meant for emergency purpose.
