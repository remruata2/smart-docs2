Zorammawii, Tuisumpui, Siaha District left Aizawl and proceeded for Coimbatore to engage themselves in house keeping job at Mowthi Nursing Home at Vandavaly, Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu). The trio were desperate to find jobs in the midst of Covid-19 pandemic as they find it hard to earn their livelihood within Aizawl city. They have been searching and craved for jobs in other states to have earnings as well as to gain broader experience. In due course, they approached Fabian Zothansanga, who inturn made arrangement through one of his Mizo friend for house keeping job at the said nursing home. However, after working for barely 1 month, H.Zosanglianna and his wife Lalruatdiki had cited their ill health issues and returned to Aizawl with the assistance of Coimbatore Mizo Welfare leaders while Zorammawii continued to work for another 3 weeks. Later she also quit her job and returned to Aizawl on 27.5.2021.

**Story of the case / incident :**

In the early part of 2021, H.Zosangliana and his wife Lalruatdiki were desperately looking for jobs in order to have earnings for their livelihood. As they could not find suitable jobs in Aizawl, they also sought jobs from other states which they thought would suit them.They were joined by their friend Zorammawii, who was also looking for jobs and willing to work outside Mizoram as well. In the course of their search for jobs they came across several people including Fabiana Zothansanga, whom they knew for quite a long time. As they were so desperate to find jobs outside Mizoram they even repeatedly urged Fabian Zothansanga to find any jobs suitable for them outside Mizoram as he had vast experience and worked in different private business establishments outside Mizoram for nearly a decade. Fabiana had contacted his Mizo friends at Chennai who in turn made arrangement to contact with the owner of Mowthi Nursing Home,Vandavali,Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu) as they were in dire need of workers for housekeeping works at their nursing home. Fabian Zothansanga then contacted the owner of Mowthi Nursing Home and made arrangement that the nursing home owner would paid all the foreward air travel expenses for the three and this would be refunded by them from their monthly salary. After making necessary arrangements including air travel tickets, the three left Aizawl from Lengpui Airport on dt.9.4.2021. They joined and started their new housekeeping jobs from dt.11.4.2021. At the nursing home, all the three were accommodated in one room which is free of charge including free fooding.

After working for about 1 month, H.Zothansanga and his wife Lalruatdiki being fed up with the monotonous nature of their works and citing health issues want to discontinue their engagement. As their 1 month salary was not enough to refund their air travel expenses, they sought financial assistance from their family in Aizawl. However, as they do not even have a valid bank account on their own, they again sought the help of Coimbatore Welfare leaders who inturn lent their bank account to enable the remittance of money from the families of H.Zodinsanga. Having received the required money from their families through Welfare leaders, H.Zodinsanga and Lalruatdiki refunded all their air travel expenses which they owed to the owner of the Mowthi Nursing Home. They returned to Aizawl on the early part of May 2021. Meanwhile Lalruatdiki continued to work for another 3 weeks at the nursing home. However, she also quit her job and returned to Aizawl during the last week of may, 2021 as she felt lonesome upon the departure of her accomplice.

In the course of enquiry, upon interrogations and based on their accounts, it is revealed that during their engagement at Mowthi Nursing Home they do not received any sort of threat or intimidation from their employer nor were they subjected to any harsh treatment or irregularity in receiving their salary.
