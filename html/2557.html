HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SOUMITRA SAIKIA<br />
ORDER<br />
05.04.2021<br />
(N. Kotiswar Singh, J)<br />
Though no one is present for the petitioner, considering the submission made by<br />
learned counsel for the respondents, we are of the view that it may not be necessary<br />
to continue this PIL. The relief claim in the PIL is as to why,<br />
&ldquo;(i) The Hon&rsquo;ble High Court will not issue an appropriate writ, order or direction<br />
asking the respondents to take immediate steps for removal of the illegal and<br />
unconstitutional blockade of National Highway, NH-306 at Lailapur and the<br />
Inter-State Highway connecting Karimganj District, Assam and Mamit district,<br />
Mizoram at Medili along with the blockade of the Railway line between Silchar<br />
Page No.# 4/5<br />
Bairabi and to ensure that such illegal and unconstitutional blockades do not<br />
take place again and after hearing the cause that may be shown by the parties<br />
to finally make the rule absolute and pass any other necessary orders or<br />
directions as deemed fit by the Hon&rsquo;ble Court.&rdquo;<br />
2. It has been submitted by Mr. R. Dhar, learned counsel for the State respondent<br />
that an affidavit has been filed on behalf of the respondent Nos. 3, 5 &amp; 7 by one Smti<br />
Prabhati Thaosen, IAS, Secretary to the Government of Assam, Home and Political<br />
Department, Government of Assam, Dispur stating that the situation in the Inter-State<br />
Assam-Mizoram border at Medly in Karimganj district is under constant vigil and<br />
District Administration had already taken all possible steps to maintain free and smooth<br />
vehicular traffic movement from Karimganj to Mizoram and the vehicular traffic<br />
including transportation of essential goods and items to and fro has been going on as<br />
usual without any interruption through Karimganj district.<br />
3. We would like to mention that it is the primary responsibility of all the States<br />
including the State of Assam and Mizoram to ensure smooth movement of traffic both<br />
passengers and goods on the National Highways and it has been submitted on behalf<br />
of the State of Assam that normalcy has been restored.<br />
4. In this regard, it has been submitted by Mr. S. Chakraborty, learned counsel for<br />
the Railways that movement of goods train in the Bhairabi-Silchar sector has been<br />
already restored.<br />
5. We have also perused the affidavit filed by one Vijoy Kumar Jha, Section Officer<br />
in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, New Delhi on 06.03.2021. It has<br />
been mentioned in Para-2 (viii) of the said affidavit that the Union Home Secretary<br />
held a meeting with the Chief Secretaries of Assam and Mizoram through Video<br />
Conference on 08.11.2020 and it was agreed that both the State Governments should<br />
take necessary steps for restoring peace at the Inter-State boundary and restore<br />
normalcy and ensure smooth movement of vehicles. It has been further mentioned in<br />
the affidavit that the vehicular movement on National Highway No. 306 connecting<br />
Assam and Mizoram restarted on 11.11.2020 and the Ministry of Home Affairs was<br />
constantly in touch with the Government of Assam as well as Government of Mizoram<br />
Page No.# 5/5<br />
and urging both the State Governments to work for restoration of complete peace and<br />
amity and de-escalate tensions along the border areas and as a result the process to<br />
de-escalate tension along the border was set in and movement of vehicular traffic was<br />
restored.<br />
6. We are of the view that if normalcy in traffic movement on the National<br />
Highway and rail, road has been restored as mentioned above, it may not be<br />
necessary to continue this PIL. Accordingly, we close this PIL. However, it goes without<br />
saying that if such situation arises in future leading to disruption of smooth movement<br />
of traffic both passengers as well as goods, the petitioner will be at liberty to approach<br />
this Court again.<br />
