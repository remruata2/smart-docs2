****Police inspectors ‘deprived’ of allowances**: Police Inspectors under the State Government have expressed shock over deprivation of compensatory allowance and ration allowance allegedly by dint of their upgradation to the gazetted group B status. Instead of entitlement of more facilities, their upgradation to higher status means a loss of ` 4239/- per month. Given the fact that they do not get promotion before ten years, an inspector will lose ` 5,20,740/- in ten years.**

 As a junior Inspector's salary will be less than that of a senior Sub-Inspector, the latter will have no desire to get promotion to Inspector rank to get less salary, a statement of Mizoram police Subordinate Officers Association said. As the Inspectors prayer to the government has fallen on deaf ears, the association is calling an extended meeting on 8th June to chalk out their future course of action.

**No news from abductors**: No news has been heard from the abductors of 3 men on 5th June, 2013 at about 9:30 AM from Badalsuri. Till Thursday, the abductors have not contacted anyone- not even the families or employers of the men they abducted, and no information has been received about the ransom they demand.

 2 (two) empty cartridges were found at the spot from where these 3 (three) men were thought to be abducted. The spot is near the border of Mizoram and Bangladesh, the border fencing wire was cut off big enough for a man to fit in, and it is likely that the abductors used the hole to take their victims to Bangladesh.

 No insurgent group has claimed to the crime but NLFT and BNDLFM are highly suspected to be involved.
