****Sialhawk village requested government to grant wine license**: Sialhawk pineapple growers have sold off Rs. 274 lakhs worth of pineapple till October of this year (2022). At the same time, leaders of Sialhawk village community requested Mizoram state government to grant them license for manufacturing wine from their pineapple, recently. Their request, which was submitted to Excise &amp; Narcotics Minister, however, has not been yet replied till today. The reason behind their desire to manufacture wine from pineapple is because of their expectation to earn more profit instead of selling their fresh products in the market. Speaking to VANGLAINI in this regard, Dr. K. Beichhua, Minister Excise &amp; Narcotics, stated that the request of Sialhawk village has not been yet discussed and license has been granted by the government for manufacturing of wines from grapes only at the moment.**
