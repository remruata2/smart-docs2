Subj  :- Verification report on arrangement of security measures in and  around the New Secretariat Complex.

Sir,

 With reference to PHQ letter No. PHQ/OPS-80/2015/200 dt. 1.7.2015, I am to state that discreet enquiry was conducted on arrangement of security measures in and around the New Secretariat Complex and the findings are stated below:

1. Armed guards are placed at the main gate of New Secretariat Complex who maintained their duties 24 hours a day.
2. Receptionists at the main entrance of New Secretariat building issued entry cards for all visitors. However, entry to the building is also possible without obtaining these entry cards.
3. DFMD are installed at the four entrances of New Secretariat building which are not closely monitored. Frisking of persons entering the building is not conducted except for large bags which may look suspicious.
4. No person, seeking interview with any Ministers/Parliamentary Secretaries is allowed to carry any bags inside along with him/her. However, frisking is also not done here.
5. Though CCTV cameras are installed inside the building, they are not functional at present.

 Considering the above mentioned points, any miscreants attempting an armed attack or bombing New Secretariat Complex will not face much difficulty. Although all the staffs are issued identity cards, owing to high number of staff, nobody is certain of who is who which added to the vulnerability of this Complex. Even the installation of DFMD/HHMD could not differentiate concealed hand gun from a mobile phone handset thereby does not much assist the police personnel on duty.

 No proper fencing is done around this New Secretariat Complex and the responsibilities of opening and closing of the four main entrance of the building are taken up by civilian keeper/chokidars.

 It can be assumed that anyone planning to attack New Secretariat Complex will choose a period between 11am to 2pm when the building reached the peak of its activities from visitors and staffs.

Yours faithfully,

**(RODINGLIANA CHAWNGTHU)**
