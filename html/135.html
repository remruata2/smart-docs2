The villagers of Daido were worried that Manipur may try to encroach Mizoram territory if it remains unresisted as the boundary pillar which was conspicuously visible on the highway had been bulldozed earlier during the construction. However there had been no further issue of the boundary dispute and the construction/repair works had since been stopped.</span></span></span></span></p>
