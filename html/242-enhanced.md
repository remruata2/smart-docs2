Sir,

With reference to your letter number cited above, I would like to report that Commandant of 225 Bn. CRPF by making an excuse of insufficiency of men in his battalion, had recently requested the PHQ to release House guards deployed from his battalion who are currently guarding the residences of Pu P.C. Lalthanliana, Cabinet Minister and Pu Ngunlianchunga, Minister of State. In this regard, my findings are as mentioned below –

  At present, one Asst. Sub-Inspector, one Havilder and 3+3 Constables are deployed for each of the said official for their House Guard duty. Even if the said commandant excuse is true, it is not convenient to release the house guards unless Mizoram Police Department can provide replacement from its own.

Direct threat or intimidation may not exist for the said officials for the time being but since Election had already been announced by the ECI for Mizoram state, provision of better security for the said officials or strengthening their security is obligatory for the state government. And also that if the house guards of the said officials are released from their duty while no other house guards of other VIPs/Officials are released/withdrawn, it is possible that the officials may feel nervous and worried; they may even have a feeling of being letdown. 

  Considering the above mentioned points, it is concluded that CRPF House guards may not be released from their present place of duty.

 Yours faithfully,

Dated, Aizawl the 16th October, 2018  Inspr. (P. VANLALRUATA)
