**I. Concerted Strategy to counter influx of drugs from Myanmar :**

 Heroin and other illegal drugs are reported smuggled into the states of Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram from Myanmar across the porous international border. Particularly for Mizoram, which shares a 496.531 kms long international border with Myanmar, drug trafficking can be easily done across the border due to its long unfenced border. Both the governments i.e., India and Myanmar have agreed Free Movement Regime (FMR) which allows tribes living along the border to travel 16 km across either side of the border without visa restrictions. Myanmar is the world’s second-largest producer of opium, and thus Mizoram is today the first point on the flow of heroin out of the region. While drugs have seeped through the unfenced border for many years, trafficking of heroin and methamphetamine has seen a steep rise in recent years. Drug trafficking in Mizoram mainly features the following dimensions:

- Trafficking of heroin and methamphetamines from Myanmar into Mizoram for sale in Mizoram and onto other states.
- Trafficking of pseudo-ephedrine precursors for the manufacturing of methamphetamines through Mizoram into Myanmar.
- Trafficking of heroin and other narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances from neighboring states into Mizoram for sale in Mizoram.

 Major drugs which are commonly smuggled into Mizoram are heroin, opium, ganja, methamphetamine, ephedrine, nitrazepam, diazepam, alprazolam and various cough syrups. The state government is taking massive effort to curb the menace of drug trafficking and has prosecuted many drug traffickers. Mizoram Police and the state Excise and Narcotics Department have had tremendous success in tackling the drug problem.

CHALLENGES:

 The major challenges faced by local law enforcement agencies, particularly the Mizoram Police in tackling trafficking of drugs/psychotropic substances are as follows:

- Although checking of vehicles for drugs and other contraband items is done at Police Check Gate at Zokhawthar (main entry point from Myanmar into Mizoram, India), smugglers/traffickers find alternate routes into Mizoram, crossing the river Tiau at various points along the 496.531 kms long porous international border with Myanmar. Lack of sufficient manpower at Zokhawthar Police Station, the main obstacle for successfully prevention of cross border trafficking of drugs. The same may be said for Vairengte Police Check Gate where drugs are smuggled into the state from Assam, mostly in load carrying vehicles. Insufficient staff and heavy flow of traffic in and out of Mizoram through Vairengte checkgate have made it difficult for thorough checking of all vehicles coming into Mizoram from Assam.

- The terrain of the Indo-Myanmar border also poses a major challenge. Rugged mountains, deep river channels together with lush forest characterize the border. Construction of means of transportation and communication is difficult in such terrain condition, and as a result, the border area remains sparsely populated with depressed economic development. Absence of better road connectivity, communication links and other border guarding infrastructure also adversely affect Policing as they hamper the easy and rapid movement of the border guarding forces along the border.

- The **Free Movement Regime (FMR)** permits tribal residing along the border to travel upto 16-km across the international boundary without visa restrictions. While the FMR has helped the tribes to continue maintaining their age old ties, it has also become a cause of concern for the security as its provisions are exploited by drug smugglers and traffickers to cross over to India (Mizoram) without any restriction. Another provision in the FMR, which allows tribal people to carry head load has also been misused for smuggling drugs, weapons and other contraband items. These head loads are seldom checked by the security forces.

- Lack of sufficient funds and other resources for engaging sources/informants have greatly hampered the ability of the Mizoram Police in gathering vital intelligence regarding the flow of drugs in and out of Mizoram, major trade routes used by smugglers/traffickers, identity and location of major players in the drug trade, etc.

- Procedural lapses on the part of Investigating Officers in cases under the ND&amp;PS Act have often resulted in the acquittal of major drug smugglers/traffickers in Mizoram and setting them scot free, thus enabling them to continue their smuggling activities. Lack of practical training and experience of Investigating Officers in investigation of drug related cases under ND&amp;PS Act have often resulted in acquittals merely on technical grounds.

**Measures to Counter Influx of Drugs from Myanmar:**

**a) Stepping up efforts to reduce demand:**

 Drug trafficking is prevalent as long as the demand for drugs persist. Mizoram has registered a high percentage of drug abusers among its 11 lakhs or so population, and is one of the highest in terms of population in the whole country. Civil societies, NGOs, various Churches and law enforcement agencies in Mizoram should put more efforts so as to reduce drug addiction amongst the Mizo youths. More awareness programme should be conducted at the school level, Church youth’s groups.

**b) Aggressively expand collaborative efforts to counter money laundering:**

**Drug smuggling and trafficking is possible only by means of transaction of huge amounts of money. Such black money involved in the drug trade is being made clean or concealed through money laundering, which paves way for drug dealers, smugglers and traffickers alike to continue their illicit business. A collaborative effort between different law enforcement agencies and concerned financial institutions is necessary in taking legal action against known or even suspicious persons involved in the drug trade to incapacitate their business transactions.**

**c) Strengthening the border:**

**The border with Myanmar, as well as other neighbouring states through which illegal drugs are smuggled in, should be strengthened in terms of manpower, means of communication and transportation and the latest hi-tech equipments for more effective checking of people and vehicles coming in and out across the border for detection of illegal drugs.**

**d) Training of Investigating Officers on ND&PS Act:**

**Police Officers empowered under the ND&PS Act should be well versed with the minute details and stringent procedures laid down under the said Act in order to avoid acquittals on account of procedural lapses which may pose a hindrance in the fight against drug trafficking. As many Police Officers as possible should undergo practical training on investigation of drug related cases registered under the ND&PS Act.**

**e) Better Cooperation among different LEAs:**

****Collection of intelligence is crucial in combating drug trafficking and smuggling. All law enforcement agencies tasked with combating such menace should cooperate closely and share vital information regarding major drug trade routes, whereabouts of key players in the drug trade, any on-going trafficking operations in the state, etc. in order to curb the menace of drug trafficking.****

****f) Special drive with NGOs:****

 The presence of a state-wide NGO such as the Young Mizo Association in Mizoram serves as an advantage in the fight against drug trafficking. The various branches of the YMA organized at the local level could be instrumental in the fight against drug trafficking as they can provide in-depth knowledge of the terrain of their respective areas, hence possible drug trade routes can be determined, sufficient manpower to augment the Police in checking of vehicles and people could be met from members of the YMA, they can also acts as a reliable source of intelligence regarding any suspected drug traders or any active drug trade in their respective areas. Hence, special drive may be conducted regularly with the YMA or any other similar organizations.

**g) Strengthening the Mizoram Police:**

 Mizoram Police has been at the forefront in the fight against illegal drugs. The Special Narcotics Police Station under CID (Crime), Mizoram has been established solely for the purpose of combating drug trafficking. The most effective means in combating drug trafficking is collection of intelligence by cultivating and engaging informants which often requires huge sums of money to earn their trust and loyalty and to carry out special operations. Also, effective means of transportation and communication as well as the latest hi-tech surveillance equipments and tactical gears are all necessary for the Police to conduct successful operations against drug traffickers. Hence, it is of paramount importance, more than anything, to strengthen the Mizoram Police with sufficient manpower, funds and resources.

****h) Setting up of new zone NCB Office at Aizawl:****

 The need for setting up of NCB Office at Aizawl is for seeking assistance purporting to Narcotics control scheme, and in order to effectively combat the rising threat of drugs trafficking in the state and also to assist the state police in investigation of drugs cases having inter-state and international ramifications.

**i) Close Monitoring Myanmar refugees:**

****Refugees fleeing military regime of Myanmar are often reportedly engaged in the trafficking of drugs and other illicit substances. Monitoring the movements of these refugees who may be a possible drugs trafficker may result in the reduction of the flow of drugs from Myanmar to Mizoram. At the same time, good relations with leaders of these refugees may be maintained so as to spread awareness amongst the refugees and to find out any habitual drugs smugglers from them.

**II. Security implications of migration of refugees into NE from neighbouring countries:**

**Indo-Myanmar Border Issue:**

 According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of unfenced International border with Myanmar, which are scattered around 30 - 40 small villages in Mizoram side. These International border posts with Myanmar are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy and Free Movement Regime (FMR) will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Due to its long porous international border with Myanmar, influx of foreigners and large scale smuggling of drugs and various contrabands into the state through the porous borders has remained a serious concern for several decades.

 The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar allow Myanmar’s national to enter up to 16 kms into Mizoram Territory without any VISA restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the Indo-Myanmar.

 Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be of great assets for the government and the border guard alike.

AMilitary Coup in Myanmarbegan on the morning of 1st February 2021, whendemocratically electedmembers of the country'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy(NLD), were deposed by theTatmadaw (Myanmar Army).

The escalating resistance put up against the military regime by Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) definitely had an impact and permeates the Indo Myanmar boundary, which resulted in influx of a considerable number of refugees arriving and taking shelter in Mizoram and Manipur. 

 Myanmar refugees have started entering Mizoram since 12th Feb, 2021 in the wake of Military Coup in Myanmar. The first batch of Myanmar refugees entered Mizoram on 12th Feb, 2021 and they were accommodated at Sangau-II, Lawngtlai District, Mizoram.

 As per our office record, as many as 29,885 (twenty nine thousand eight hundred and eighty five) Myanmar refugees presently taking shelter within the state as on 22.4.2022 and they are staying at Temporary/Makeshift Camps set up by NGOs at various locations across the state. Some refugees are also staying at their relatives’ house and some are staying in a rented house.

The below mentioned table depicted numbers of Myanmar Refugees presently staying in various Districts of Mizoram as on Dt. 31.03.2022:

| **Sl.No** | **District** | **No. of Refugees** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Aizawl | 1916 |
| 2. | Lunglei | 1986 |
| 3. | Champhai | 7810 |
| 4. | Lawngtlai | 5475 |
| 5. | Siaha | 9817 |
| 6. | Hnahthial | 1732 |
| 7. | Serchhip | 433 |
| 8. | Kolasib | 149 |
| 9. | Saitual | 53 |
| 10. | Khawzawl | 64 |
| 11. | Mamit | 450 |
| **Grand Total** |  | **29,885** |


It has been reported that various instances of seizure of drugs smuggling and other contraband items from the illegal possession of Myanmar refugees occurred in recent days. Myanmar refugees may also be involved in other crimes such as theft, physical assault owing to their poor financial condition. The following measures may be taken to curb security threat from Myanmar refugees:

1. **Strengthening of Security and Intelligence Network along Mizoram-Myanmar Border**:

In addition to deployment of Assam Rifles at the international border, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) at various Border Outposts (BOPs) along the border, supplementing the Central Armed Forces.

Apart from strengthening deployment of Assam Rifles along the border, it is also necessary to set-up new Police Stations/BOPs (with the financial assistance of Central government) along the border areas to act as a second layer behind the Assam Rifles for keeping effective watch on the infiltration of Rohingyas migrants/foreigners and other cross border criminal activities.

1. **Detection and proper registration of along Mizoram-Myanmar Border.**

In order to detect illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram, 3(three) Special Task Force (STF) had already been set up in three districts of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.

__Similarly, Special Task Force (especially for Myanmar refugees) may also be set up at the district level to identify and maintain proper registration of Myanmar refugees staying inside the territory of Mizoram in the wake of Military Coup_._

Suggested Cost Effective solutions for border management:

1. **Beefing Up of Security along international border**:

The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar allow Myanmar’s national to enter up to 16 kms into Mizoram Territory without any VISA restrictions and this may facilitate unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar, if left unchecked. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the Indo-Myanmar and Indo-Bangla border. Regular area domination patrolling should be conducted along the international border.

1. **Maintaining close cooperation with the people:**

Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar and Indo-Bangla border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be of great assets for the government and the border guard alike.

1. **Maintaining close coordination with counterpart Security Forces****:**

The two border guarding forces viz. Assam Rifles, who are guarding the Indo-Myanmar border and Border Security Force (BSF), who are guarding Indo-Bangla border should try to have close coordination with Myanmar Army and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB)through routine meeting, joint patrolling along the border etc.

1. **Constitution of Border Crime and Security Committee****:**

The Border Crime and Security Committee under the chairmanship of concern District Superintendent of Police and head of border guarding force and other concern departments’ viz. Custom &amp; Excise, Land &amp; Revenue etc.as its members should be constituted. The committee should review the security and crime situation of the international border within the district and meeting should be held regularly, any suggestions/proposal relating to border security/crime should be submitted to Police Headquarters for further submission to the state Home Department for necessary action.

1. **To adopt multi-pronged approach of Border Security**:

In order to seal the Indo-Myanmar and Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government should adopt multi-pronged approach which includes construction of border fencing, floodlighting, setting up of more Border Out Posts (BOPs) along the border, induction of latest surveillance equipments like Hand Held Thermal Imagers (HHTI), Night vision Goggle/Devices, etc.

1. **Setting up of Police Station/Outpost in the bordering villages****:**

Presence of Police Stations/Out Posts in border villages deter trans-border criminals, infiltrators, illegal immigrants and hostile elements from indulging in the activities of intrusion/encroachment and border law violations. In order to effectively manage and prevent cross border crime and law &amp; order situation in the bordering villages, the state government should set-up more civil police stations/outposts in bordering villages, located at a strategic location. The Police Stations/Outposts could also act as second layer behind the BSF/Border Out Posts (BOPs)/Assam Rifles to keep effective watch on happenings in border villages.

**Indo-Bangladesh Border Issue:**

The 319.791 Kms long porous international border between Mizoram (India) and Bangladesh could be a security threat and migration routes for illegal immigrants into Mizoram. **As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division, further infiltration of illegal migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.**

****It is necessary to explore the possibilities to tackle and check on growing influx of illegal migrants from neighboring Bangladesh.

1. **Setting up of Border Management Division****:**

Many states in the country are having a separate Border Management Division and considering the strategic location of the state, it is imperative to set up a separate Border Management Division in the State. The state has border with militant infested Countries viz. Bangladesh and Myanmar, and States viz. Manipur, Tripura and Assam and there have been many instances of seizure of Arms, smuggle items viz. Arms, Drugs etc. and report has been received on many occasions regarding use of the state as transit by various militant groups and there have been alleged reported infiltration of illegal Bangladeshi in southern districts of the state. A separate Border Management Division under Home Department/ Police Headquarters should be set up, which will specialize in managing the border.

1. **Cross Border Delivery by Pregnant Women**_:_

 There have been reported instances in the southern districts of Mizoram that many pregnant women from Bangladesh enter the state on the pretext of seeking medical assistance and giving birth due to poor medical facilities in their area. As the new born baby has to be registered by the Hospital, they can easily get citizenship status of the country by birth. The matter has to be dealt carefully as it can be security threat for facilitating illegal infiltration and compromise Citizenship status in the Country.

1. **Setting Up of Immigration Check Post****:**

 Special attention should be given to districts having international border viz. Mamit District, Champhai District,Lunglei District,Hnahthial, Saitual, Serchhip, Lawngtlai District and Siaha District. The State is conduit for illegal migration due to its long porous international border and ethnicity linked with the bordering countries. The Chakmas/Brus community dominated areas in the southern and western part of the state should be given more focus in respect of illegal infiltration due to its reported abnormal growth rate. Immigration Check Post should be set up in areas which are vulnerable for illegal infiltration. The Immigration Check Post should be set up under the supervision and control of concern District Superintendent of Police. A proper report should be maintained at the Immigration Check Post.

1. **Strengthening of Task Force specially constituted to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram &deportation:**

In order to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram and for their deportation, 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District. These Special Task Forces should be reinforced by making separate budgetary provision, routine meeting etc. for their effective functioning.

**5. Expedite Border Fencing work:**

The Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing was started in Mizoram in the year 2005. The total length of international border fencing proposed along Mizoram- Bangladesh border was 344.41 Km. The border fencing work should be expedited in order to prevent illegal infiltration.
