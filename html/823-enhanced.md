**The** **Project** **:** **Indo-Bangladesh** **at** **the** **initial** **total** **656** **crore**

**Border** **Fencing** **Project** **estimated** **cost** **of** **Rs.**

**Objective:**

**Scheme:**

**To** **put** **up** **physical** **barrier** **along** **336.62km** **long** **Indo-Bangladesh** **border** **for** **internal** **security** **of** **the** **country.**

**The** **scheme** **comprised** **of** **four** **components**

_(1)_ _Fencing_ _(2)_ _Road_ _(3)_ _BOP_

_(4)_ _Floodlighting_

**Modalities for execution of work :**

**1****.** **Fencing/Road:**

The physical topography of the international border with Bangladesh is placed below -

• _Land_ _boundary_

• _Riverine_ _boundary_

_-_ _44.95_ _kms._

_-_ _291.67_ _kms._

Out of the total 336.62 kms, 180 kms fall within the purview of E&amp;F department, out of which 118 kms falls under the category of reserved forest and the remaining 62 kms falls inside the Dampa Tiger Reserve.

**The** **following** **agencies** **have** **been** **entrusted** **the** **border** **works** **as** **under–**

Â—**Border Roads :**

_NBCC_ _-_ _155_ _km_ _NPCC_ _-_ _141_ _km_ _EPIL_ _-_ _53_ _km_ _BRO_ _-_ _20_ _km_

As per the scheme, fencing is to be erected at a distance of **150** **yards** from the International Border but in a situation where, owing to inhospitable terrain / topography , it is not possible to adhere to this stipulation, the guidelines permit that in such cases, the fencing could be erected within as much as **500** **yards** inside Mizoram from the **zero** **(0)** line. However, these guidelines have not been uniformly followed by the Executing Agencies and alignments were made as per convenience. In some locations, entire villages are outside the fencing; in some cases, the fencing cuts through the middle of existing villages creating problems in the entire border areas of Mizoram. The brief are as follows -

q _Villages_ _cut_ _by_ _IBB_ _fencing_ _-15_ _villages_

q _Partially_ _damaged_ _by_ _IBB_ _fencing_ _-_ _18_ _villages_

q _Villages_ _bifurcated_ _by_ _IBB_ _fencing_ _-_ _13_ _villages_

q _Villages_ _totally_ _fenced_ _out_ _-_ _3_ _villages_

Â—**F****REE********M****OVEMENT********R****EGIME********:**

• The State Government is in the process of formulating a set of guidelines for the

effective implementation of the FMR as per the latest agreement between the Govt. of

India and Govt. of Myanmar in the form of Border Pass.

• The State Government has set up 4(four) designated crossing points for the purpose of

implementation of the FMR listed below. The major bottleneck faced in the

implementation of the FMR is the lesser degree of observance of the FMR on the other

side of the border which may perhaps be attributed to ignorance of the provision of

the same by the concerned authorities of the neighbouring country.
