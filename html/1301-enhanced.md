Over the past several years, India has been the victim of large scale terrorism sponsored from across the borders. There have been innumerable incidents of terrorist attacks, not only in the militancy and insurgency affected areas and areas affected by Left Wing Extremism, but also in the form of terrorist attacks and bomb blasts, etc., in various parts of the hinterland and major cities, etc. A large number of such incidents are found to have complex inter-State and international linkages, and possible connection with other activities like the smuggling of arms and drugs, pushing in and circulation of fake Indian currency, infiltration from across the borders, etc. keeping all these in view, it was felt that there was a need for setting up of an Agency at the Central level for investigation of offences related to terrorism and certain other Acts, which have national ramifications. Several experts and Committees, including the Administrative Reforms commission in its Report, had made recommendations for establishing such an Agency.

The Government after due consideration and examination of the issues involved, proposed to enact a legislation to make provisions for establishment of a National Investigation Agency in a concurrent jurisdiction framework, with provisions for taking up specific cases under specific Acts for investigation.

Accordingly the NIA Act was enacted on 31-12-08 and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was born. At present NIA is functioning as the Central Counter Terrorism Law Enforcement Agency in India.

NIA has registered and investigated 93 cases till date. After submission of chargesheets, 13 cases have been finally or partially decided in trial. Of these, 11cases have ended in conviction giving NIA an enviable conviction percentage of 85%.

| **1.** | **Can a State Government request the NIA to take over the investigation of a case?** |
| --- | --- |
| **Ans.** | A State Government may request the Central Government to hand over the investigation of a case to the NIA, provided the case has been registered for the offences as contained in the schedule to the NIA Act. |
| **2.** | **Can the Central Government issue directions to Suo-Moto take over the investigation of a case?** |
| **Ans.** | As per the NIA Act, the Central Government can order NIA to take over investigation of any scheduled offence anywhere in the country. |
| **3.** | **Can the State Government investigate cases under the scheduled offences?** |
| **Ans.** | Yes. NIA Act provide for such a provision. |
| **4.** | **What will be the role of State Police during investigation of a case by the NIA?** |
| **Ans.** | NIA will seek assistance from the State Police during investigation of cases by the NIA, and in that situation, it is incumbent on the State Police to assist the NIA. |


National Counter Terrorism Centre

From The**National Counter Terrorism Center**(**NCTC**) is a proposed federal anti-terror agency to be created in India, modelled on theNational Counterterrorism Centerof the USA. The proposal arose after the2008 Mumbai attacksaka 26/11 attacks where several intelligence and operational failures revealed the need for a federal agency with real time intelligence inputs of actionable value specifically to counter terrorist acts against India. The NCTC project of India is very significant for the national security of India[1]and it must be constituted as soon as possible.[2]

Genesis of the idea[edit]

Theterrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008was unprecedented in its scale and intensity and betrayed gaping holes in India's intelligence network with respect to the collection and coordination of intelligence and action between various agencies of the state and Union governments.[3]While theMaharashtra Governmentwas accused of having failed to act on intelligence inputs provided prior to the Mumbai attacks, it countered that the inputs were vague and no preemptive action could have been taken based on these inputs.[4]The attacks and the government's response to them led to the resignation of theUnion Home MinisterShivraj Patiland he was replaced by theFinance MinisterP. Chidambaramwho stated that one of his first tasks was to establish a strong federal counter terror agency that could co-ordinate with the states effectively by integrating intelligence inputs from the states.

It was in this context that the NCTC was mooted as an apex body, a single and effective point of control for all counter terrorism measures. The NCTC is modelled on the American NCTC and Britain'sJoint Terrorism Analysis Centre. The model for India was mooted by the then Home Minister, P. Chidambaram, who along with the then National Security Adviser,M.K. Narayanan, had visited the USA in 2009 to study the functioning of the US' NCTC.[4]

Structure and Functions[edit]

The NCTC will derive its powers from theUnlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967. It is to be a part of theIntelligence Bureauand will be headed by a Director who will report to the Director IB and the Home Secretary. But the modified original draft of NCTC says that this system does not come under purview of Intelligence Beaureu and states are taken into confidence before the centre carries on any operation in their territories. The NCTC will execute counter-terror operations and collect, collate and disseminate data on terrorism besides maintaining a data base on terrorists and their associates including their families. The NCTC has been empowered to analyse intelligence shared by agencies like the Intelligence Bureau and select what it deems suitable. It has also been granted powers to conduct searches and arrests in any part of India and will formulate responses to terror threats.[5][6]

Opposition to the NCTC[edit]

The NCTC proposal has faced much criticism from the Chief Ministers of various states who see this as a means of weakening India's federalism.[5]Unlike the American NCTC which deals only with strategic planning and integration of intelligence without any operational involvement or the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which too plays a purely coordinating role, the Indian agency will have not only intelligence functions but also powers to conduct operations. It is this concentration of powers that has had the states objecting to the NCTC, arguing that such sweeping powers vested in a Central agency will violate the autonomy of state governments, given that law and order is astate subjectaccording to theConstitution.[7]It has also been argued that given the establishment of theNational Investigating Agencyin the aftermath of the 26/11 attacks, the establishment of an NCTC would only add to the bureaucratic tangle in intelligence sharing and counter terrorist action.[8]

It is also argued that the nature of US and Indian federal structures differ vastly and hence suitable amendments are needed for the agency to be effective while guaranteeing the constitutional rights of the states. Some strategic experts like B.Raman of theR&amp;AWhave pointed out that there are significant loopholes which may still be used in selectively targeting states for political ends. The UPA govt has stuck to its decision to set up NCTC and has promised to resolve all concerns amicably.[9]The Union Home Ministryis believed to be making extensive changes on the NCTC proposal to theCabinet Committee on Security, including one to make it as a separate organisation outside the IB.[10]

The initial opposition to the NCTC also focused on how the agency had been empowered to search and arrest people without keeping the state government, police or anti-terror squad in the loop. The Centre has since mooted that theDirectors General of Policeand the chiefs of anti-terror squads of all states be made members of the Standing Council of the NCTC. These senior police officers are to be informed before the NCTC conducts an operation in their state.[10]

the establishment of NIA is no doubt a positive step in fighting terrorism-related crimes, but it is unlikely to be a panacea to prevent terrorist attacks. For, it will be an agency that investigates and prosecutes only after terrorist attacks take place. Though the NIA no doubt would contribute to a better understanding of how the attacks were planned and carried out, the linkages between terrorist cells within the country as well as outside, the modus operandi of terrorist cells and groups, etc., it is unlikely to prevent terrorist attacks. What will be needed is greater co-ordination between various agencies engaged in intelligence collection, collation and analysis. This can be achieved either through a more effective functioning of the Joint Intelligence Council (JIC) or alternatively by reorganising the entire Indian intelligence set up along the lines that the United States has done in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks.

**NEW DELHI: When a bomb went off last month in West Bengal state, police at India's leading counterterrorism organisation had to hail taxis to get to the scene because they did not have enough cars. The admission by two officers from the National Investigation Agency underlines how poorly equipped it is to fulfil its role of investigating the most serious terrorism cases, cutting off funding to militants and putting suspects on trial. **INFIGHTING AMONG INTELLIGENCE GROUPS** Like many countries, India has several intelligence and investigation agencies. The Intelligence Bureau is the domestic unit and the Research and Analysis Wing is an external spy agency. The military runs its own intelligence wing and so do paramilitary organisations like the Border Security Force. Infighting continues to hinder India's ability to prevent attacks and agencies are often reluctant to share information.. The Indian intelligence services have long been plagued by stove piping and failure to share information," said Bruce Riedel, a former senior CIA expert on South Asia who has advised President Barack Obama on policy in the region. "Modi's new national security adviser, Ajit Doval, a long-time intelligence professional, will have the job of making the services perform at a higher level." The NIA was supposed to be complemented by a National Counter Terrorism Centre that would sit above other agencies and sift through what they provided, as well as a national intelligence database accessible by other agencies... But the plan has been stalled by opposition from Indian states concerned about giving up powers to central government. India's constitution makes law and order primarily a state issue, and NIA officers say part of the problem is that they need help in intelligence gathering from local police, who are typically poorly trained and ill-equipped. At present, when Indian police arrest suspects there is no way to check if they are wanted, a problem that has led to embarrassing blunde.. **

**The prime minister should perhaps drop the police role of the NCTC, leaving it free to focus its energies on intelligence gathering, coordination and operations, says Anil Chowdhry, former secretary, internal security, ministry of home affairs.**

Anyone who has dealt with or understands internal security issues will tell you that the National Counter Terrorism Centre is an imperative. Such a body is required to meet the growing threat of terrorist violence which recognises neither national nor international boundaries, especially for a country like ours, which faces a high level of threat.

Under our Constitution, law and order and policing are undoubtedly the responsibility of the state governments. But at the time our Constitution was framed there were no organised terrorist groups of the kind operating globally today.

Post Independence, communal and political ideology driven violence was the worst that the police forces were called upon to tackle.

The current scenario is vastly different.

Realising the seriousness of the threat from trans-national terrorism, almost all major democracies including the US, UK, and other European countries have been able to enact and create central agencies to tackle the menace, within the framework of their respective federal structures, placing national security concerns above partisan politics.

Unfortunately, in our country a similar initiative has got caught in controversies -- mostly political, and partially by the manner in which the NCTC was sought to be created by the Cabinet Committee on Security via a proposal mooted by the nodal ministry for internal security, the ministry of home affairs.
