****BRIEF NOTE ON THE ISSUES OF BRU REFUGEES****

**HISTORY**

The Brus also called Reangs are the Nomadic Tribe living in the western belt of Mizoram, bordering Bangladesh and Tripura State. The Brus started entering into Mizoram around 1940's and engaged themselves in jhum cultivation. The Brus were living in 14 villages in Kolasib District, 11 villages in Lunglei District and 46 villages in Mamit District and spread over 9 Assembly Constituencies (i.e. Hachhek, Dampa, Mamit, Tuirial, Kolasib, Serlui, Lunglei South, Thorang and West Tuipui)

 Political awareness developed amongst the Brus since 1990 with the formation of political party called Reang Democratic Party in June, 1990. Bru Student Association and Bru Welfare Committee were also formed to promote the welfare of Brus in Mizoram. In 1994 the RDP, BSA and BWC at a joint conference formed a new political party called the Bru National Union (BNU) by merging the three organisations. The BNU conference held in September, 1997 at Saipuilui village in Mamit District adopted a resolution for creation of Autonomous District Council for Brus in the western part of Mizoram which was strongly objected by the Mizo community in the concerned area. A militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) formed in 1996 under the leadership of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news of the killing spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by BNU. Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram towards Tripura.

The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government. The Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum (MBDPF), headquartered at the Naisingpara camp on the eastern side of the Jampui Hills is an apex body for Brus living in 6 (six) refugees camps in Tripura. The Forum was created in 2002.

After a number of meetings between the Centre and the State authorities were held, date for repatriation of the Bru refugees was fixed i.e. 16th November, 2009. While all preparations for repatriation process were going on smoothly a Bru militant group who called themselves the Bru Revolutionary Union (BRU) killed a Mizo youth Zarzokima (17), on 13th November, 2009. It was later confirmed that killing was done deliberately by the BRU in order to deter the repatriation process.

Even though the killers of the innocent Mizo youth left a note with a letter head 'Bru Revolutionary Union', subsequent investigation and statement given by persons involved in this murder case revealed that there is no such organisation as 'BRU' but a group of Bru miscreants who had been instigated by some section of MBDPF leaders to derail the repatriation process who did such heinous crime. Nevertheless, there are two known armed groups who operated in the Mizoram-Tripura border and Mizoram-Assam border who had secret understanding with some leaders of MBDPF who could be utilised when the need arise. The existence of these armed groups was revealed based on the revelation made by one of their leaders arrested by Mizoram Police named Henry recently. Reliable information received stated that this very group are the one who gave warning to refugees not to obey the Govt's plan of repatriation and who instilled fears amongst the Bru Refugees.
