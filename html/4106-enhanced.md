The situation escalated leading to violent clashes between the Bengali settlers and the minority community in the CHT which reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least three people and destruction of numerous homes of the Chakma community. Acknowledging the reported atrocities of the indigenous Chakmas in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the Chakma community of Mizoram under the aegis of Central Young Chakma Association along with all the civil society organizations of the Chakma community organized a protest rally at Kamalanagar, District Lawngtlai, Mizoram on 22.09.2024 followed by a candle lighting rally on the same night.

**II. **Security scenario in Mizoram with special reference to insurgency and smuggling**:**

 Security scenario in Mizoram is mostly peaceful. However, with the influx of refugees into Mizoram due to the political condition in the neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh, some commercial activities are being exploited/used by these refugees to earn their living which is not welcome by the local residents of Mizoram. Morever, the refugees have started involving in criminal cases within Mizoram. Recently, on Dt.23.09.2024, one Arakan Myanmar refugee who was employed in a shop had stolen a huge amount of cash amounting to Rs.10 lakhs with one scooty from his employer at Lawngtlai Chanmari Veng and he was later arrested and a criminal case had been registered against him.

 Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and reorganise themselves. They have been indulging in collection of donation and extortion from the closing months of 2022. In this regard, 27 criminal cases have been registered in Mizoram against the cadres of Lalhmingthanga Sanate (HPCD) faction till date out of which 8 cases have been Chargesheeted and 7 HPC(D) cadres arrested.

 There have been instances of allegations by Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) that miscreants of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) particularly Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Shamiti (PCJSS), United Peoples Democratic Front (UPDF), Kuki Chin National Front (KNF) are either staying inside India or establishing their camps inside India which was last highlighted in the Veracity Report of BGB Booklet during the DG, BSF and DG, BGB Level Border Conference held at Dakha, Bangladesh between 5th to 9th March 2024. However, District Police and CID (SB) of Mizoram Police independently conducted spot verification/inspection during the month of August and October 2023 as well as in the month of January 2024 and found no such miscreants or their camps inside Mizoram, India particularly in Lunglei and Mamit Districts.

The arm resistance put up by the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) in general and armed ethnic groups of Chin State, Myanmar to overthrow the military regime in Myanmar since 1st February 2021 resulted in the influxes of considerable number of refugees particularly the Chin Community into Mizoram. Since the Military Coup, there has been a reported 8 (eight) major influxes of Myanmar Nationals into the State. Leaders of these ethnic groups held a workshop at Aizawl during 7th – 8th Sept.2023 in the goal of forming an interim Government at Chinland .

Apart from the Chin community, due to the arm clashes between the State Administration Council’s (SAC) Myanmar Army and Arakan Army in Rakhine State and the subsequent capturing of almost all important cities by the Arakan Army, some communities of Khumi tribe are also seeking shelter into the Southern part of Mizoram reportedly due to the atrocities of the Arakan Army.
