****Discussion with Governor in connection with low PGI**: Yesterday i.e 28.9.2022, Mizoram Governor, Dr. Hari Babu Kambhampati held a discussion programme with senior officials of Mizoram School Education Department, at Raj Bhawan, in connection with the low Performance of three districts in Mizoram in the latest Performance Grading Index (PGI). According to the report of School Education Secretary, the scores of Mamit district (126), Serchhip district (125) and Lawngtlai district (106) were way too low in the PGI 2018-2019. However, Serchhip and Lawngtlai districts achieved slight improvements in 2019-2020 while Mamit district still remained low (136). Official of School Education Department told the Governor that the reasons behind this was the failure of concerned authorities of the three districts to report some of their achievements which lowered their scores. The Governor, on his part, advised the officials to give proper instructions to supervisors and Headmasters regarding administrations and their responsibilities.**
