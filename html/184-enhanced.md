| 1. | Pu Hiphei Hon’ble Speaker | No immediate threat has not been perceived till date. Pu Hiphei is also comfortable with the present level of security provided to him.

| 3. | Pu R. Romawia, Hon’ble Minister | With three (3) Personal Security Officers (PSOs) and proper House guards, security arrangement for the moment is found satisfactory in respect to Pu R. Romawia. Nevertheless, it is opinioned that improvements in a way of smartness, general conduct and efficiency of PSOs are still required.  |

| 5. | Pu H. Rohluna, Hon’ble Minister | Presently, three (3) Personal Security Officers are allotted to him. His resident which located at Ramthar Veng is also continuously guarded by static armed guard. Although his security arrangement has been found acceptable for his movement inside the city area, it is felt that intensification of security arrangement is necessary during visits to his constituency since some part of the east side of the constituency which is bordering Myanmar falls within the operational area of Zomi Revolutionary Army, an underground militant group of Myanmar origin.   |
| 6. | Pu Zodintluanga, Hon’ble Minister | Pu Zodintluanga currently having three (3)PSOs and armed guards is not under any threat and his security arrangement has been found sufficient for the time being. However, it is suggested that the general conduct and efficiency of PSOs be improved. Moreover, small arms i.e. Pistols/Revolvers alloted to PSO were reportedly old and unreliable. As a result, inspections of such arms were conducted and the report about which was found correct. Hence, it is suggested that dependable arms be allotted to the PSOs.  |
| 7. | Pu John Rotluangliana, Hon’ble Minister | Pu John Rotluangliana, Hon’ble Minister who was elected from Mamit Constituency do not have any known direct or indirect threat at present. He is presently having three (3) PSOs who are following a daily duty schedule from 9:00 Am to 6:00 Pm. His resident is also guarded by static armed guard continuously.

| 8. | Pu PC Lalthanliana, Hon’ble Minister | With his armed house guard including three (3) dynamic PSOs, Pu PC Lalthanliana’s security arrangement was found fitting.

| 9. | Pu Lal Thanzara, Hon’ble Minister | He is provided with armed house guards and three (3) PSOs who are staying with him during office hour i.e. 9:00 Am – 5:00 Pm including holiday.

Through night and day his resident is guarded by armed police and he is as provided with three (3) PSOs. But since the PSOs are usually do not turn up at the Minister’s resident while he is on tour, it has become highly debatable whether the PSOs will stay at Minister’s resident to guard his family members while he is on tour.

His security arrangement which comprises of armed house guards and three (3) PSOs is found sufficient for the time being. It is recommended that the Minister's guard be strengthened when he is in and around Chawngte due to the recent outbreak of violence in Chawngte.  |


**Note :**

In general, the security conditions and arrangement towards the above mentioned Hon’ble Speakers, Hon’ble Home Minister and other Council of Ministers are found to be satisfactory. Since direct/indirect threat and intimidation had never been heard or received by anyone of them, it is felt unnecessary to bring up new level of security arrangement in terms of armed house guard and PSOs. But as indicated above, some PSOs guarded the officials round the clock while some PSOs guarded them only during office hours. In some cases, PSOs left the officials every Sunday morning leaving them unprotected and some PSOs never show up at the official’s resident while the official is on tour. It was then learnt that such dissimilar pattern of duty deployment had caused unspoken problems towards the officials also. It is hence highly recommended that a clear-cut Duty guidelines/protocols for the PSOs be made/provided, which may as well contain general rules of conducts (i.e. Dos and Don’ts for PSOs) so as to maintain similar pattern of duty for every PSOs who are protecting officials.

In regard to the VIPs’ General Security in and around their office i.e. Govt. Secretariat Complex, Aizawl, it is felt that the armed guard sentry post should be increased by erecting at least three more sentry posts at suitable corners outside the office which now have only one sentry gate at the main-gate. If possible, allotment of one platoon of armed police for this purpose is suggested. It was also learnt that there are four (4) exits at the secretariat building’s ground floor each of which are equipped with DFMD, but as a matter of fact, only the main entrance i.e. the main door is guarded with police personnel, the other three minor exits are not specifically guarded. It is strongly suggested that static armed guard as well as security police personnel be posted at each of three unguarded exit.

The vehicles parking arrangement at the New Secretariat Complex is also highly unsystematic and could become huge trouble in case of emergency situation. It is hence suggested that more systematic arrangement of vehicles parking and entry at the main entrance be chalked out. Smooth flow of traffic should also be kept which is necessary for swift and speedy evacuation of the building’s premises in an emergency situation.
