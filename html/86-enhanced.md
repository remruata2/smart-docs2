Ref: Letter No.RSB/60/2012/509 dt.22.2.2012.

Sir,

  With reference to the above noted letter, I would like to humbly state that I have not violated Rule 839 of Mizoram Police Manual, Rules 3-C(21) and Rule 3-C(26)3 of CCS Conduct Rules. The submission of a joint representation to the Secretary, Home Department was due to the following reasons. I was recruited as SI vide Order dt.7.7.2000 and in the Final Seniority List of SI of Police dt.21.3.2011, 13.2.2002, 19.9.2004, 19.7.2006, 13.8.2007 and 20.11.2008. I have always been shown "Senior" to the SI's promoted on 19.9.2000. Thereafter, by Tentative Seniority Lists dt. 31.1.2011, 24.5.2011 and 5.8.2011, my seniority position was changed. I submitted representations to the above tentative seniority list. However, my representation was not acted upon and final seniority list dt. 28.12.2011 was published wherein my seniority position was changed to my detriment. Besides the change in my seniority position, WT message dt.15.12.2011 was issued in which I had been called to attend the Pre-Promotion Course for SI commencing on 15.1.2012. However, WT message dt.15.12.2011 was superseded by WT message dt.28.12.2011 and my name was not included in the WT message dt. 28.12.2011. Being aggrieved with the Final Seniority List dt. 28.12.2011 and being dropped from participating in the Pre-Promotion Course commencing from 15.1.2012, I and some of my colleagues approached Advocate Avilla Laltanpuii Renthlei with our problem. Advocate Avilla Laltanpuii told us to make representation to the Secretary to the Government of Mizoram, Home Department. I and my friends requested her to make the draft representation on our behalf and Advocate Avilla Laltanpuii Renthlei accordingly drafted the representation for us. The representation dt. 4.1.2012 was accordingly submitted to the Personal Branch of the Home Secretary as instructed by Advocate Avilla Laltanpuii Renthlei, as the Police Organisation is under the Home Department.

  I believe I have not violated the Rules mentioned in the above referred to letter. Any violation of the Rules that I might have made is unintentional and I deeply regret the same. I therefore, request your kind office to close the above matter and forgive me for my mistake I have committed.

Yours faithfully,

SI (LALBIAKMAWII RENTHLEI)
