Subject :  _Report on Myanmar National who obtained Aadhar Card in Mizoram reg._

Sir,

 In response to your order no. MSB/CB/A-5(R)/500 dt.28 July 2022, an enquiry was conducted on some Churches in Mizoram, Lengpui Airport, Post office Aizawl and some of common service canters inside Aizawl. One fake account, Zoa Khiangte posted on facebook group called Mizo Special Report, his personal experience about Myanmar National obtaining Aadhar Card on different channels. Regarding this post the following are my finding :-

1. Upon enquiry, Post Office staffs of Aizawl said that some names of Adhaar cards which are likely to be Chin people had being received at Post Office and then they sent it to the concerned local councils for further dissemination. But no unwelcoming response from the local councils was received till today.

1. After carefully investigation, there is no Church leaders who issued Baptisma Certificate to Myanmar Nationals and either this certificates are not directly useful for obtaining Aadhar Card.

1. At Lengpui Airport, Myanmar Nationals those who used fake Aadhar Card for travel accesses were apprehended for few months earlier. When enquiry, some of fake Aadhar Card were made from Delhi by using Photoshop Editor. Enhance, in fear of apprehension no other Myanmar Nationals does not go through Lengpui Airport and changed there route to Delhi by road. Airport authority said that there is no checking machines for Aadhar Card holders identifiacation but it is done manually by airport Police staffs.

1. By visiting some common service centre in Aizawl, they point out that exert of “The Aadhar Act, 2016” which stated that an individual who has resided in India for a period or period amounting in all to 152 days or more in the 12 months immediately preceding the date of application for enrolment can obtain Aadhar Card by submitting his demographic imformation and biometric information.

 Therefore, it is found that some of Myanmar Nationals who had been staying more  than 12 monts in India are eligible for obtaining Aadhar Cards as per the Aadhar  Act, 2016.
