**Brief History:**

 I was born and grew up in Hmarkhawlian village, Cachar. I passed class X from Union H/S, Hmarkhawlian. Since I was a teenager, I have been looking after my father’s Pineapple plantation which is located about 3kms from Jeribam village. This has become my main source of income till today.

 My wife is presently working in Partnership Mission School with a monthly salary of Rs. 3000. My daughter is currently training Staff nurse at Guwahati under the sponsorship of Barak Valley council while my son is studying class VI at Pailapur.

 In the year 1997, Pu Lalhmingthanga Senate (founder President of HPC ‘D’) often used me as a runner and in the year 2000, I was inducted as Finance In-charge by HPC ‘D’ council meeting held at Hmarkhawlian. By 2008, I was again sacked from my position as I could not meet our organization leaders’ expectation in my job. During these period, we used to collect donation from bamboo and timber traders who were operating on the banks of Tuirial River and Tuiruang River. From each trader, a sum of Rs. 15000/- (per annnum) for one Elephant was collected. The main reason why I was sacked from my post as I believed was because of suspicion of mismanagement (corruption) of these funds.

 From the year 2010 i.e. after the demised of my father, I was busily engaged in doing house-hold chores until 2013 the year which I was again re-appointed as Finance In-charge by HPC’D’ (Zosangbera’s faction). Despite my protest to their given appointment by saying I would not be able to work in full time, they nonetheless appointed me to this post.

 At present, the annual income of HPC ‘D’ which reaches me is around Rs. 700000 – Rs. 800000 (approx.). The construction of Tuirial Hydel Project greatly reduced the volume of flowing water which decreases bamboo, timber etc. transportation which inturn reduces our annual income to around 20% on this day.
