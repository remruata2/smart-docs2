****DRAFT STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE(SOP) FOR LARGE-SCALE EXODUS OF PEOPLE/REFUGEES FROM NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY INTO INDIAFOR THE STATE OF MIZORAM****

1. **INTRODUCTION****:**

** **Mizoram** is located in the north-eastern part of the country and is bounded byMyanmar(Burma) to the east and south andBangladeshto the west and by the states ofTripurato the northwest,Assamto the north, andManipurto the northeast. The capital Aizawl is in the north-central part of the state.**

 Mizoram (“Land of the Mizos”) was known as the Lushai Hills District of Assam before it was renamed the Mizo Hills District in 1954. In 1972 it became a centrally administered union territory under the name of Mizoram, and in 1987 it achieved statehood. Area 8,139 square miles (21,081 square km). Pop. (2011) 1,091,014.

Mizoram has 496.531 kms long international border with Myanmar and 319.791 kmswith Bangladesh. While the Border Security Force guards the Bangladesh border, the border with Myanmar is guarded by the Assam Rifles.

In recent year,it has been reported that**over 2,70,000 (two lakhs seventy thousand) Rohingyas refugees entered Bangladesh through border points of Chittagong Division (Bandarban, Rangamati&Khagrachhari Cox Bazar, etc) in recent year.****As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division, further infiltration of illegal migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.**

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Due to its long porous international border with Myanmar and Bangladesh, unlawful influx of foreigners and large scale smuggling of drugs and various contraband into the state through the porous borders has remained a serious concern for several decades.

****The Mizoram Government is exploring possibilities to tackle and check on growing influx of illegal migrants from neighboring Bangladesh and Myanmar.

1. **SUGGESTED MEASURES TO BE TAKEN FOR PREVENTION OF ILLEGAL ENTRY OF FOREIGNERS OF MYANMAR AND BANGLADESH INTO MIZORAM**_._

**(i) Strengthening of Security and Intelligence Network along Mizoram -Bangladesh Border and Mizoram-Myanmar Border**:

In addition to deployment of Assam Rifles and Border Security Force at the international border, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) at various Border Outposts (BOPs) along the border, supplementing the Central Armed Forces.

Apart from strengthening deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) and Assam Rifles along the border, it is also necessary to set-up new Police Stations/BOPs (with the financial assistance of Central government) along the border areas to act as a second layer behind the BSF/Assam Rifles for keeping effective watch on the infiltration of Rohingyas migrants/foreigners and other cross border criminal activities.

**(ii)****Fencing of****Mizoram-Bangladesh border:**

In order to prevent illegal migration and illegal activities including anti-national activities from across the border, the Government of India had sanctioned the construction of border fencing with floodlights in two phases. 233 km is to be fenced out of 319 km border with Bangladesh. The fencing work should be expedited.

(**iii) Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agencies and Intelligence agencies about Rohingyas Crisis and its security implication, etc.**

 Mizoram Police, BSF, Assam Rifles etc. should be sensitized about Rohingyas crisis so as to enable them to take prompt steps in identifying illegal migrants and to initiate the process of deportation, etc. This could be achieved through Seminar, Workshop, etc.

**(iv) Detection and deportation of foreigners along Mizoram-Bangladesh/Mizoram-Myanmar Border.**

****(1) Special Task Force (STF):****

 In order to detect and deport settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram , 3 (three) Special Task Force (STF) had already been set up in three districts of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.

__Similarly, Special Task Force (especially for Rohingyas migrants of Myanmar) may also be set up at the district level to identify and deport illegal staying of Rohingyas migrantsinside the territory of Mizoram_._

**(2)****Arrest of Rohingyas by Mizoram Police:**

 Till 31.12.2019, no Rohingyas refugees from Rakhine State of Myanmar have taken shelter in any part of Mizoram. However, there were32 illegal immigrants (ie, Rohingya) apprehended in the state of Mizoram. Constant vigil along the border is necessary to prevent any unauthorized entry of Rohingyas into Mizoram.

**(3) Arrest of Bangladesh Nationals by Mizoram Police:**

 Mizoram Police have arrested 4 (four) Bangladesh Nationals illegally entering Mizoram during 2019.A coordinated effort with the BSF is needed to effectively guard Mizoram-Bangladesh border.

**(4) Myanmar Refugees:**

 There was an encounter between Myanmar Army (MA) and rebel Arakan Army (AA) on 26.2.2018 @ 11:00 am at Kumprang Village on Myanmar side of the border close to Kakichhuah of Lawngtlai District. The State of Mizoram had witnessed cross border incidents like fleeing of 1750 Nos. of Myanmarese from villages like Varang, etc., under Paletwa township of Chin State, Myanmar into the different villages of Mizoram due to fierce clashes between Arakan Army (AA) militants and Myanmar Army (MA).Continuous efforts should be made by all concern state holders to prevent and detect such illegal entry on refugees into Mizoram.

1. **PROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED IN CASE OF DETECTION OF LARGE-SCALE EXODUS OF PEOPLE/REFUGEES FROM FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRY INTO MIZORAM INCLUDING MIGRATION AND INFILTRATION:**

1. As soon as the Border guarding force or any security agencies detect large-scale exodus of people/refugees from neighboring countries viz. Myanmar &amp; Bangladesh, they should immediatelyconduct discrete enquiry to ascertain the following:

1. Whether they possess any valid document viz. VISA, Passport, ID Card etc.
2. Their country of origin.
3. Reason of entry.
4. Their manner and mode of entry.

1. If foreigners/large scale refugees enter into the country without proper document or any valid reasons, the Border guarding force/security agency must immediately report to District Superintendent of Police or Officer in Charge of nearest Police Station and they have to be adequately dealt with under the Foreigners Act, 1946, Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939 and Citizenship Act, 1955 and the Rules and Guidelines made thereunder.

1. Upon detection of large scale exodus of people/refugees from neighboring countries into Mizoram, Health Department should also be immediately roped into plan and action. Personal health concerns of the refugees should be given due attention. All concern stakeholders of the State should work hand-in-hand in providing necessary resources, such as temporary shelter and food, so as to avoid starvation or outbreak of disease and special focus should be given to vulnerable persons, particularly children, women and elderly people.

1. In case a foreign national claim to be as refugees, the security personnel should carefully examine the version of the foreign national making such claim. Details of the reasons for leaving the originating country and the manner in which he/ she has entered India should be elicited from the foreigner. In case, it is found that prima facie the claim is justified, (on the grounds of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, sex, nationality, ethnic identity, membership of a particular social group or political opinion) they should immediately inform the concern District Deputy Commissioner/Superintendent of Police who will then inform State Home Department for necessary action.As India is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees, 1951 or its Protocol of 1967 and as such there is no Migration/ Refugee Policy. None of India's neighboring Countries is a signatory to this Convention/Protocol. However, under the SOP issued by Ministry of Home Affairs in 2011, a foreign national can stay in India on Long Term Visa (LTV) if it is proved that he has been a victim of oppression in his native country on account of his caste, religion, nationality etc. If such situation arises,the State Home Department should inform FRRO/FRO concerned, who will then take necessary action for issuance of LTV as per guidelines issued by MHA.

1. The state may take necessary step for setting up of temporary detention center in each international bordering district for providing temporary shelter to foreigners who are not yet issued LTV or deported to their originating country. In such district, a committee may be formedheaded by District Deputy Commissioner to take necessary action for illegal foreigners detained in such center.
