****According to the petitioner Pu Vanlalenmawia, Special Judge (Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988), the power vested in him is original criminal jurisdiction with Sessions power, and that the threat perception is no less than the other Hon’ble Judges. Moreover, while previously functioning as Addl.
