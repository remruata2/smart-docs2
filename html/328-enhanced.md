HMAR PEOPLES CONVENTION (DEMOCRATIC)

1.  Background :
  The Hmars, an ethnic group of Mizoram mostly settled in the North Eastern part of the State have been aspiring for a separate administrative set up mainly due to the instigation of the elite and educated members of the community who propounded that the Hmars are a    separate ethnic community with distinct culture as compared to the Mizo speaking populace of Mizoram. However, it may be mentioned here that the Hmars were never regarded as a distinct ethnic community, historically and culturally. Their only distinctiveness is that they spoke the Hmar dialect which is however having very close affinity to Mizo - a dialect of the Luseis - which is now accepted as the official language of Mizoram. The Hmars also spread-out as far as Haflong in North Cachar Hills District of Assam and the Churachandpur District of Manipur. It may be mentioned here that the settlement of the Hmars in the adjoining areas of Manipur and Assam among other ethnic groups with distinct cultures and customs gradually made them ethnically self-conscious and vulnerable. This sentiment of alienation gave birth to political aspirations among the elite section of the community culminating in the formation of political platform such as the Hmar National Union (HNU) etc. as late as in 1957 with the proclaimed objective of preserving the democratic rights, culture and ethnic identity of the Hmars within their dominated areas of Manipur and Assam.

2.  Demand for Autonomous District Council by HPC :

  The Hmars being a dominant ethnic group of Mizoram have never felt the need nor aspired for any special political status for their community in Mizoram. They were a secured and contented community. However, mainly due to the influence of the Hmars living out side the State, politically ambitious section of the community started propounding the need for preserving their democratic rights, culture and ethnic identity. In 1986 the Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) was formed with the sole objective of the creation of an Autonomous District Council (ADC) for the Hmars within Mizoram. Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent unlawful activities like abducting and killing of the Mizoram Police   personnel, extorting money etc. and thus jeopardising the law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area.

3.  Signing of Peace Accord :

  The Mizoram Police was geared up and the Government of Mizoram eventually managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants resulting in the signing of a Peace Accord on 27th July 1994. The HPC militants surrendered formally to the Govt. of Mizoram as per the provision of this Accord and these persons were given financial grants for their rehabilitation etc. The Govt. of Mizoram also agreed to set up the Sinlung Hills Div. Council (SHDC) for the socio-economic upliftment of the people living in the Hmar dominated areas. Accordingly adhoc Chairman and members constituting the council were even appointed by the Govt. of Mizoram from among the leaders of the erstwhile HPC set up. Peace was thus restored in Mizoram after the signing of the Accord.

4.  Formation of HPC-'D' :

  However, inspite of the above there were still a disgruntled section of the HPC set up, led by Lalhmingthanga Senate, the then General Secretary of the HPC who were not ready to lay down their arms as they were not in agreement with the terms of the Peace Accord. Soon after, a new militant outfit was formed by L.Z. Hrangchal, the then Marshal of HPC, known as the 'Hmar Revolutionary Front' (HRF) with base in Parbung Sub-Division of Churachandpur District, Manipur. Following closely, Lalhmingthanga Senate also formed a militant outfit called the Hmar Peoples Convention -Democratic (HPC-'D') in 1996 with its nerve centre at Hmarkhawlian (Lakhipur) in Cachar District of Assam. The 2 (two) newly formed outfits are totally opposed to each other both proclaiming themselves as champion of the political aspirations of the Hmars, and both resorted to seeking the assistance of other insurgents such as the NSCN(I/M) and the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) for subduing each other in their struggle for supremacy. Lalhmingthanga Senate in particular has been having close connection with the NSCN(I/M) even before the signing of the Peace Accord in 1994. It may be mentioned that Lalhmingthanga Senate did not surrender to the Govt. of Mizoram in 1994 and hence floated the militant outfit known as the Hmar Peoples Convention-Democratic (HPC-'D') in the later part of 1996. Following the surrender of the HRF outfit in 2000, Lalhmingthang Senate cut off ties with the NSCN(I/M) and established close ties with the UNLF/PREEPAK of Manipur.

5.  Objective :

  As mentioned above Lalhmingthanga Senate did not come overground in 1994 as he refused to accept the Accord signed between the Govt. of Mizoram and the HPC set up. He remained underground and continued liaison with the cadres of the NSCN(I/M) and spent his time in Hmarkhawlian in Cachar District area and Haflong in North Cachar Hills District of Assam. He claimed himself leader of the un-subdued HPC faction till striving for a separate homeland for the Hmars.

  However, he is of late advocating that the Govt. of Mizoram has deliberately delayed the implementation of the Peace Accord signed in 1994, though himself refusing to accept the terms and conditions of the said Accord. It may be mentioned here that the Govt. is having no intention of not implementing the Peace Accord as can be seen from the appointment of the Chairman and Members of Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) in 1997. Therefore, the HPC-'D' led by Lalhmingthanga Senate has nothing to do with the implementation or non-implementation of the Peace deal reached between the Govt. of Mizoram and the erstwhile HPC.

  The HPC-D may therefore be regarded as a group of disillusioned youths who can be branded only as "TERRORISTS" with no legitimate political cause. The HPC-D in other words can be described as the private army of Lalhmingthanga Senate formed solely to further his private interests.

83. On 27.6.09, 18 labourers engaged in sawing timber in Tinghmun Forest area have fled their work site last night i.e. 26.6.09 as they feared that they were being forced to work in the construction of camp by HPC (D) at Ankhachhuah located opposite to Tinghmun Forest on Manipur side of the border. The HPC (D) are understood to have asked the employers of these labourers to sent at least three pairs of labouresrs to work in their ongoing construction of Designated Camp at Ankhachhuah for which they work be paid as per their daily wages rate. However, these labourers began to flee fearing that they would be detained by the HPC (D). It appears that there was no physical intimidation nor armed infiltration on the part of the HPC (D).

 Further unconfirmed report received indicated that 12 members of labourers engaged in the same trade had been compelled to proceed to Ankhachhuah on 25.6.2009 by the suspected HPC (D) from Tinghmun village. The said 12 members were believed to be Myanmarese National engaged in sawing timber at Tinghmun village. Authenticity of information is being confirmed.

84. On 24.7.09, Intelligence gathered over a period of time indicated that the HPC (D) have been expecting some sort of peace initiative from the Govt, of Mizoram since the induction of new Congress Ministry. They (HPC-D) were understood to be of the view that even though they are prepared to hold talks with the Govt. they are reluctant to make the first move for the same. There are indications that amid this egoistic attitude on the part of the HPC(D), the possibility of their resorting to violent activities targetting BOPs on Mizoram-Manipur borders in order to draw the attention of the Govt. coud not be ruled out.

85. On 1.8.09 Pu R.L. Pianmawia, MLA , Govt. Deputy Chief Whip received a letter signed by Joseph L. Hmar, Finance In-charge, HPC(D) asking him to ensure that Pu Zonunsanga be allotted construction work of Zohmun - Mauchar road Group No.VI so as to meet the financial requirement of the HPC(D).

 The tender was submitted in the name of Pu L.T. Kima Fanai s/o Pu L. Piandenga of Electric Veng, Aizawl. The estimated amount of which is Rs.206 lakhs. The matter was enquired and ascertained that Pu Zonunsanga a resident of Aizawl Venglai was prompted by Pu Thangliana, HPC(D) Public Relation Officer-cum-Finance Committee Member to submit the said tender with a view to get 5 to 10 percent of the profit from the construction work as is practiced in Manipur. For this purpose Joseph L. Hmar was assigned to do the needful. Further enquiry revealed that HPC(D) General Secretary Lalsangbera flatly denied the hands of HPC(D) in the instant case.

 In another letter addressed to the DFO Darlawn Division Joseph L. Hmar demanded Rs.10 lakhs from Darlawn Division of Mizoram Forest to be delivered before 5th Aug 2009. Thangliana however, denied having any knowledge while admitting that the possibility of making this demand note by other HPC(D) leaders could not be ruled out. Further enquiry being done and situation under close watch.

86. Belated information received that HPC(D) had summoned the two factional leaders of HPC viz. Malsawma Darngawn and the newly elected leader Thanglianchhunga at Churachandpur separately on two different occasions. Malsawma Darngawn alongwith his trusted colleagues namely,  1) Thangchuanga of Sakawrdai, former Vice President and (2) Lalhmingthanga of Ratu, former Council member of SHDC were summoned last week. It is learnt that the HPC(D) had told them to respect the people’s mandate and also warned them to stop lobbying with the government for the Chairmanship post of SHDC. It is learnt also that Thanglianchhunga has been asked to take steps towards unity of the Hmar people.

Lalpianmawia, MLA. The HPC(D) are understood to have strongly resented this move by the Government, and criticized the Govt. who they alleged had verbally assured the HSA/HYA during their earlier interview on the eve of election whosoever would be elected new leader would be made interim Chairman of SHDC and the statement made by the Chief Minister in this regard will never be forgotten.

87. Some unknown persons who called themselves HPC(D) contacted Sakawrdai VCP by telephone instructing the leaders of the under mentioned villages to come to Thingpuikual village in Manipur.

On receipt of information, combing operations was immediately conducted by Mizoram Police in the Mizoram-Cachar/Manipur Border area within Mizoram State.

23.11.09 The HPC (D) submitted a Memorandum to the Hon,ble Chief Minister of Mizoram expressing their desire for TRI-PARTITE political talk involving the Govt. of India, Mizoram and HPC (D) for the permanent solution to the Hmar Political problem. The main demands of the HPC (D) is creation of Hmar Territorial Council in the State of Mizoram within the scope of the Sixth Scheduled of the Constitution of India. The Memorandum are as follows:

The July 27, 1994 Memorandum of Settlement (moS) between the Government of Mizoram and the Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) is a political blunder. Hence, it was not accepted by the Hmar People's Convention (Democratic) - HPC (D), which is the breakway group from signing the blank documents.

Fifteen years after the signing of the MoS, is has proved to the world that the documnets hold no water and, does not stand to fulfill the aspirations of the Hmar people to secure their political future. As such, in pursuance of the unfinished agenda of the Hmar people, the HPC (D) is committed to find a political solution to the Hmars' political aspirations with the creation of Hmar Territorial Council (HTC) in the State of Mizoram within the scope of the Sixth Scheduled of the Constitution of India. This will be mutual benefit and based on the long-term interest of both the Sinlung originated Hmar peoples and the Government of Mizoram.

We remain firmly committed not to seek seperation from Mizoram. Rather, we are seeking a solution to the unfinished agenda of the Hmar people, which is compatible with the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India. The HPC (D) believes that the protection of Hmar identity, culture, tradition, language, land and resources and political development lies in the creation of Hmar Territorial Council.

HMAR ASPIRATIONS

The HPC (D) desires that the Hmar people actively participate and contribute to the economis and political development of Mizoram. However, we would like to ensure that this happens without losing our unique identity, culture and core values and without putting our distinct and fragile ancestral land and resources that are at risk. The commitment of the HPC (D) in seeking a political solution of the Hmar people within the State of Mizoram is clear and unambiguous. Despite the armed movement, which was inevitable, HPC (D) firmly believes that the unfinished agenda of the Hmar people could be resolved through dialogue.

While we are committed to fully respect the territorial integrity of Mizoram we are also expect the Government of Mizoram and the Government of India to recognise and fully respect the political ridhts of the Hmar people by creating Hmar Territorial Council (HTC) in the State of Mizoram. HPC (D) believes that this is the basis for resolving the Hmar political aspirations.

HPC (D) advocates a long term solution addressed and ends the political marginalisation suffered by the Hmar people. It also believes that no solution will lead to peace if it is not just: and it won't be just if it does not advance the Hmar people's aspirations. We firmly believe that no political solution will be complete without the creation of the Hmar Territorial Council.

THE WAY FORWARD

As stated above, the HPC (D) stands to realize Hmar political aspirations with the creation of Hmar Territorial Council within the framework of the Sixth Scheduled of the COnstitution of India. We firmly believed that this is consistent with the principles of the constitution of India. HPC (D) represents the collective interests and aspirations of the Hmar people and boldly speaks on their behalf.

To bring about a permanent political solution of the Hmar people in Mizoram, the HPC (D) firmly believe that a tripartite political dialogue involving the Government of India, Government of Mizoram and the HPC (D) is immediately initiateds.

30.11.09 Information received indicated that the HPC(D) is intending to re-submit its memorandum to the Hon’ble Chief Minister dt. 17.11.09 which was earlier submitted to the Hon’ble Home Minister during his absence to satisfy themselves that the Chief Minister actually receives it. It is learnt that the memorandum is being sent through the same messenger and likely to be delivered tomorrow morning ie. 1.12.09.      While awaiting Govt’s response, the HPC(D) are learnt to be pessimistic about the Govt’s keenness to hold a political dialogue, and in the event of slightest negative response on the part of the Govt. which might cast doubt on the HPC(D)’s hope for a dialogue, the possibility of their resorting to violent activities targetting BOP’s within their demand area to draw the attention of the Govt. cannot be ruled out.      It may be recalled that the attack on Ist IR pay escort party on 2.9.09 near Saipum was reportedly promted by remarks of the MHA official that the existence of the HPC(D) had not even been known to them while the HPC(D) approached them in N.Delhi for SoO agreement during Aug ‘08. The attack, therefore, was carried out, thus sending a message to the MHA that the HPC(D) existed.      It may also be recalled that the HPC(D) had issued strong warning objecting the construction of Tipaimukh Dam on dt. 29.7.09. Hence, officials of the NHPC Ltd. are also vulnerable to kidnapping by the HPC(D).

It is learnt further that the meeting had decided to mould a public opinion on the dissolution of SHDC and also agreed to hold such consensus during January 2010.

28.6.11 The PR issued by HPC(D) on 27.6.2011 laid blame on the Government of Mizoram in connection with Hmar issues in Mizoram, in which the Government was accused of not taking any perceptible step to extend the Suspension of Operation (SoO) even with a written request by the HPC(D). The PR condemned local and national newspapers for publishing baseless statements about the issue of Hmar people from responsible authorities which contain no element of truth. The Government of Mizoram is allegedly keener in derailing the peace process than to work out the legitimate demand of Hmar people. As such, the HPC(D) declared the expiry of the SoO period and the process of talk is still in the hands of the Government of Mizoram to renew the talk. The HPC(D) considered 1994 Peace Accord as deceptive and void and resolved to be set aside. However, The HPC(D) request the Government of Mizoram to resolve the Hmar issue in Mizoram once and for all.
5.7.11 Belated information has been received that during the 1st party of June, 2011.

 The letter however, did not make any mention of the place and time and to whom the deducted money is to be submitted. How many Village Councils have received the demand letter is yet to be ascertained.

25.8.11 S/S Commander Thangsiem HPC-D post an e-mail to various local dailies and weekly under caption "CM Pu Hawla'n faksel phu" in Mizo dialect. The main theme of the message is criticizm and concerns against the statement of Pu Lal Thanhawla, Chief Minister in the recently concluded Mizoram Assembly Session and if the HPC-D resorted to any subversive activities, it will be only because they are compeled to do so. The message was concluded by emphasizing that the best way of solving the Hmar problem is through a political dialogue.  
25.8.11 In pursuance of all party meeting held at Sakawrdai, a peace rally was held by the people of HPC demand area today, i.e. 25.8.2011 at Sakawrdai, Suangpuilawn and Saiphai as follows :-

  (i) Sakawrdai : Around 500 people participated in the rally where Pu Thanglianchhunga, President, HPC and Pu Remruata Varte, Editor, Zolife magazine delivered speeches.   (ii) Suangpuilawn : Around 250 people participated in the rally and                Pu Tlangkhangliana, MUP Secretary delivered a speech.   (iii) Saiphai : Around 400 people participated in the rally. Pu L. Thansanga, Gen. Secretary, HPC party and H. Zohmingthanga delivered speeches. The rally was started at 12:00 Noon respectively and each of them shouted the same slogan and passed the 3 (three) points resolutions as follows :-

(a) Condemnation of non-implementation of Mizoram Government and HPC Memorandum of Settlement dated 27th July, 1994. (b) Demanded the Central Government and the Government of Mizoram to have a talk with HPC(D) to bring about peace in the HPC demand area. (c) Demanded the Government of Mizoram to take steps for peace for the people of Sinlung Hills Council demand area.

26.8.2011 H.Zosangbera, HPC(D) General Secretary sent e-mail to Rev.Vanlalzuata, Senior Executive Secretary, MIZORAM SYNOD asking him to arrange means for resuming peace talk between HPC(D) and the Mizoram Govt.  

5.9.2011 Information has been received that the HPC(D) has agreed to join the SoO group under KNO, and severed its membership from the UPF. The information received suggests that the HPC(D) President Lalhmingthang Sanate had already signed an agreement with the KNO President P.S Haokip at the secret meeting at Tuibuang, Churachandpur on 31st August 2011. The news, however, came as a surprise following strong reaction and disapproval from amongst the outfit’s top leaders including S/S Army Chief who is learnt to have criticized his president for making such decision without consulting his or other colleagues. The HPC(D) President, Lalhmingthanga Sanate is understood to have informed his Gen.Secy. H. Zosangbera that he preferred to discuss the matter at a meeting the next day i.e. 6.9.2011, and not over phone, indicating that he had a better idea about opting the KNO rather than UPF.   The HPC(D) President appeared to have been convinced that joining the KNO in demand for a statehood out of Manipur would be the only option for their survival under SoO agreement. Further inputs received also suggest that the agreement (to join the KNO) might include a status under the sixth schedule for the Hmars in Tipaimukh area.
8.9.2011 As per the information received, the recent peace rally organised in the name of all party at Sakawrdai, Saiphai and Suangpuilawn on 25.8.11 was sponsored by HPC(D), an amount of Rs.50,000/- sanctioned by the HPC(D) was received by Thanglianchhunga of Sakawrdai from H.Zosangbera, Gen.Secy a few days before the rally.   While the rally was intended to revive talks between the Govt. of Mizoram and HPC(D), intelligence input received suggests that another motive behind sponsoring the rally was to show their control over the entire people within their demand area and that the HPC(D) have political influence over the 3 legislative constituencies within their demand area i.e. Serlui, Tuivawl and Chalfilh constituencies.   It may be recalled that Thanglianchhunga was elected President of the HPC party on 2.7.2009 at Saipum presumably due to the blessing and support of former HPC President Hmingchungnunga who was not in a position to contest the election.

14.9.2011 HPC(D) council meeting held on 13.9.11 at an undisclosed location in Churachandpur discussed about HPC(D) joining KNO group as per green signal given by their President Lalhmingthang Sanate. After lengthy deliberation and hot debate on the topic, the council meeting decided not to join KNO and even persuaded their President to withdraw his earlier decision which the President reportedly agreed.
29.9.2011 HPC(D) High Command led by S/S Army Chief Ropuia in a secret meeting held at Churachandpur is plotting to impeach its President Lalhmingthanga Sanate. As per the input, Lalhmingthanga Sanate no longer enjoys the majority support of his Cabinet colleagues because of his recent agreement to join the KNO without consulting his Cabinet. It is learnt that the President has also been charged of misappropriating party fund.   While the HPC(D) President is being impeached on charges of misappropriation of party fund, the fact remains that his impeachment has something to do with the ensuing Manipur Assembly Election which is due in February next year. As per the input received, differences between the President and his cabinet had manifested since last one month when Lalhmingthanga Sanate reportedly signed an agreement to join the KNO group without consulting his colleagues. Input received suggests that Lalhmingthanga’s idea of joining the KNO was to gain some political mileage even outside the Hmar dominated areas of Manipur while his army chief and others were trying to back up an individual candidate(s) who are otherwise not in the list of those likely to be backed up by the KNO.   Intelligence input received further stated that Lalhmingthanga is trying to convince Thangsiama, S/S Commander to join his side, saying that he, as a founder President, felt being humiliated for being impeached on false charges. It is also learnt that Thangsiama who is now in charge of about 11 nos. weapons of different types which are secretly kept outside the SoO agreement refused to give away the weapons under his charge and chose to remain neutral saying that he didn’t want division in the organisation, and that he would rather make efforts for the unity of the organisation instead of taking sides.   S/S Commander Thangsiama who is presently staying in Churachandpur is also understood to be making a secret arms deal with one Thanga(Paite, who is known to have a secret link with ZRA). As per latest input received, 6 nos. of ‘HK-53’ smuggled from Chikha, Myanmar located close to Mizoram-Manipur border are being delivered and the transaction is likely on Sunday i.e. 2.10.2011.   It is learnt that while the S/S Army Chief Ropuia has majority support of the council members, the President is understood to be supported by Robert, S/S Defence Secretary, JC. Hmar, S/S Information Secretary and few cadres. Input received indicated further that Lalhmingthanga Sanate is still lobbying within the organisation as well as from outside such as Hmar Inpui, Hmar Student Association etc. insisting that he still enjoys support of more than 80% of the general Hmar people.




3.10.2011 Executive Council emergency meeting of HPC(D) held on 29.9.11 has impeached its President Lalhmingthang Sanate for signing a Deed of Agreement to join the KNO camp without consulting the HPC(D) Executive Council, the highest policy maker of the HPC(D) organisation and regarded his action as a betrayal of Hmar cause.   A press statement issued in this regard issued on 30.9.2011 warned their deposed President not to indulge himself in any activities in the name of HPC(D) or Hmar community and also to accept his mistakes as well as impeachment from the presidenship.    16.10.2011 The HPC(D) issued a Press Release regarding the killing of ex-DHD(J) leader James Dimasa on 13.10.2011 and burning down of Dimasa houses at Longen village near Haflong on 14.10.2011.   27.10.2011 Impeachment of its president had resulted in both the factions trying to take control of their hidden weapons in Manipur as well as in Hmar demanded areas of N.C. Hills, Assam. A group (7) loyal to Lalhmingthanga Sanate had taken out 8 nos. of weapons hidden in the jungle, north of Haflong today i.e 27.10.2011 and headed for a location known as Khuanglung village about 3 hours journey on foot north of Haflong.The group is likely to move towards Haflong after burying the weapons and would follow jungle routes to avoid rival group led by Roger S/S PRO present in the area who are also trying to take control of the hidden weapons.   It may be recalled that Biaknunga S/S Dy. Chief of Army had taken control of weapons in Vangai Hills earlier during 2nd week of October, 2011.






8.11.2011 Deposed HPC(D) President Lalhmingthanga Sanate is now hiding in Saikot and adjoining Khawpuibung area in Churachanpur, in a bid to regroup and to counter his rival factions. Lalhmingthanga Sanate has chosen this area as base Hqrs. believing that he has majority public support, and obviously as the jungle within the vicinity provides safe sanctuary in the event of possible army patrol in the area. Lalhmingthanga Sanate group had so far procured about 10-15 weapons of different type including 1(one) lethode with 9(nine) nos. of ammunitions out of which 9(nine) weapons are presently kept hidden in Mualhoi, NC.Hills.   Input suggests that armed confrontation between the two rival factions of HPC(D) could not be ruled out in the near future despite intervention by Hmar NGO and Church leaders as both the factions focus on Manipur State Legislative Assembly election which is due in February, 2012.
8.11.2011 It was learnt that the HPC(D) Ropuia Faction has instructed S/S Comdr.El-a i/c of designated camp to desist Oil Company from entering Tipaimukh/Vangai area for oil exploration.

20.12.2011 The two rival factions of HPC(D) are having a dispute over fund collection from contractors under Vodafone company who are doing OFC(Optical Fiber Cable) laying works between Ratu and New Vervek on Tipaimukh road. Input suggests that Lalhmingthanga’s faction may infiltrate into Mizoram during January 2012 to physically intimidate contractors to divert some 3/4 % out of the estimated amount for a 3 kilometer long cable laying works. It is learnt that their rival (Ropuia’s faction) had earlier collected money at the same rate of percentage for the 15 kilometer long cable laying works already completed on Tipaimukh road.

12.1.2012 A press release dated 7.1.2012 purportedly signed by Ramthan Hmar SS Southern Commander of HPC(D) was published in Vanglaini daily newspaper this morning. The press release while expressing support for their president Lalhmingthanga Sanate, strongly resented the peace initiatives taken up by Thanglianchhunga and his colleagues alleging that their motive was merely for personal gain.   It was reported that Zosangbera, Gen.Secy. of the rival faction had reacted taking exception for publishing such item while their press release werer never published in the Aizawl based newspapers. Zosangbera also expressed suspicion that the press release was mere handiwork of former HPC factional leader Lalrosiem who happened to be the cousin brother of the deposed president Lalhmingthang Sanate.   It was learnt that Lalhmingthang Sanate faction are intending to submit a memorandum to the Govt. of Mizoram in the near future for holding/resuming talks.

14.2.2012 The Executive Council of the HPC(D) after expelling its president Lalhmingthang Sanate from his position and party, put the party in interim for six months. In its recently concluded sittings, the Executive Council of the HPC(D) collectively adopted a written Constitution for the party. In pursued of strengthening the goals of the party and the collective aspirations of the Hmar people, the Executive Council of the HPC(D) has finally put an end to the interim state of the party by electing H.Zosangbera as the Chairman of the HPC(D). The HPC(D)’s new constitution has also opted for chairmanship system instead of president-ship system to reorganise the party structure.

  The HPC(D), after the ceasefire with the Govt. of Assam and the Govt. of India, is currently engaged in a constructive political process in Assam. To secure the political aspirations of the Hmar people of Assam, the HPC(D)(Assam Region) will be headed by its vice-chairman Elvis L.Hmar and Secretary David L.Hmar. The HPC(D), hereby, reiterate its stand that it will not engage in any ‘press release battle’ with the expelled Lalhmingthang Sanate who outrageously sold out the unity and integrity of the party.

  When the HPC(D) is engaged in a significant peace and political process in Assam, Manipur and Mizoram with the sole interest of securing the political aspirations of the Hmar people, the party is also weaving the collective resolutions of the Hmar people who are divided by political boundaries. At the same time, the HPC(D) is also seriously engaged in building peace at all levels. Therefore, the state actors should not be confused when it comes to talking to the HPC(D). Let no one entertain a divide and rule game when the cause of the people is inevitably at stake.

15.2.2012 Information received from different sources revealed that representatives of all political party leaders from 12 (twelve) villages of Tuisualral numbering about 50 (fifty) met HPC-D cadres at Thingpuikual (Manipur), on the bank of Tuiruang river adjacent to Kani village (Zokhawthiang, Mizoram) @ 8:00 PM on 15.2.2012 as summoned by the HPC-D. The meeting took place in the residence of Thingpuikual village authority chairman and lasted for 2 (two) hours.   The HPC-D cadres headed by Lalbiakliana @ Biaka, S/S Area Commander, accompanied by 8 nos. of HPC-D cadres, all armed with sophisticated AK-47 rifles and M-16 rifles told the 50 strong members of different political party leaders to help all HPC party candidates win for the ensuing V/C election within Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) area, in a polite but pursuasive and compulsive manner.   Some of the political party leaders reached Vaitin village last night @ 9:00 PM and the second batch arrived Vaitin @ 11:20 PM last night, i.e. 16.2.2012. As per the report of political party leaders who attended the meeting, the HPC-D are very determined in their diktat and disobeying their request within SHDC area would be very risky for any political party leaders within the area. Further input received from the interaction of village leaders suggested that casting of votes with peace of mind may be impossible in this situation even if foolproof security is provided in the area during election if the result of V/C election comes out against the wishes of HPC-D insurgent group.

18.2.2012 Input received indicated that the HPC-D summoned all party leaders of three (3) villages on 18.2.2012 at Dolakhal (Assam) which was attended by 16 village representatives, i.e. Saipum - 6, Mauchar - 5, Saiphai - 5. The HPC-D who summoned the villagers are 8 - 10 in number, all armed with sophisticated weapons.The leaders, Neihliana (who hailed from Sakawrdai) told the village leaders to make HPC VC in their respective villages for the forthcoming VC election as winning the VC seats by HPC party would be crucial for resumption of peace talk between HPC-D and Government of Mizoram.   The village representatives raised their voice against the diktat of the insurgent group by stating that all nominations of VCcandidates had already been finalised and they might not be in a position to inform all the voters in such a short notice. HPC-D, however, insisted that they would do so as they were told and further warned that they would be held responsible if the outcome of the election became against the wishes of the HPC-D.   It may be mentioned that HPC party filed their nomination in the following villages as under :-


  (i) Saipum - HPC party - 5, Others - 5   (ii) Saiphai - HPC party - 5, Others - 5   (iii) Mauchar - HPC party - 3, Others - 13      Unconfirmed report received from source stated that the HPC-D Sangbera faction had been convinced by Thanglianchhunga, President, HPC party, Sakawrdai during his visit to Manipur sometime back and the HPC-D leadership, in compliance with their meeting’s outcome, has carried out such action.


22.2.2012 information received from Sunhluchhip village stated that one Remsanga, VC candidate of Sunhluchhip village was contacted through mobile phone by one who claimed himself as Biaknunga of HPC-D telling him to elect only HPC party candidates in their village for the ensuing VC election. The matter was informed to Constituency MLA, Pu R. Lalpianmawia today, i.e. 22.2.2012 by Sunhluchhip VC members. Some VC candidates contacted by CID (SB) officers stated that they are in a dilemma whether to concede with the demands of the caller who called himself to be HPC-D as there could be a chance of imposter playing dirty tricks. It may be mentioned that there are 3 VC seats at Sunhluchhip in which the following parties are contesting seats as under :-
  (1) Congress  - 3   (2) ZNP + MNF  - 3   (3) HPC   - 2   (4) Independent  - 1


9.3.2012 HPC(D) are trying to send weapon consignment from Rengkai, Churrachanpur in a truck carrying ration items for their cadres in Vangai Range. The consignment will include 20 nos of SBBL guns with 500 cartridges, 5 nos of AK-47 and 10 nos of hand grenades which are concealed in 50 bags of rice/sugar. As per input received, the weapons which were concealed inside rice bags are now kept in Samson’s godown at Rengkai and the consignment will be escorted by CT Sungte  (Ex-Manipur Police). The consignment is likely to be transported via Parbung on Tipaimukh road probably on the night of 10.03.2012 (Saturday) or, latest by 11.03.2012, and the same would be received by S/S Area Comdr. Lalbieklien somewhere in Vangai.

11.03.2012 HPC(D)’s weapons consignment reached its destination i.e. Vangai today i.e. 11.03.2012 and now kept in safe location. There are indications that weapons are being shifted towards Tiaulien side once coast is clear. It is obvious that they have changed earlier plan of moving along Tuiruang river downstream from Tipaimukh as they sensed that the Army were on high alert about their movement. CT Sungte has been instructed to proceed towards Hmarkhawlien to avoid possible arrest by Security Force. S/S Army Chief Ropuia intends to go to designated camp on   Dt. 14/15.03.2012.
13.3.2012 Information received stated 19 nos of weapons (SBBL and DBBL guns) belonging to HPC(D) (Sangbera faction) were destroyed by fire on dt. 13.03.2012 in a jungle near Kangreng. According to the information received the weapons were kept hidden in a jungle close to Kangreng jhum area when the local farmers who were unware of the hidden weapons carried out their traditional burning of the jungle for jhum cultivation on that day. The information received stated that 6 weapons which were kept at a separate location were safe.   It may be recalled vide that a consignment of 25 weapons (20 SBBL/DBBL guns and 5 AK-47 rifles with 500 rds. of 12 bore cartridges and 10 nos of hand grenades) was secretly carried out by the outfit from Churachandpur to Vangai area on the night of 10.03.1012. It is reported that the weapons consignment had reached its destination on the night of 11.03.2012.

17.4.2012 The HPC(D) (Sangbera’s faction) had issued a press release today expressing strong resentment over the alleged attitude of the CYMA leaders on the issue of the HPC(D)’s demand for an Autonomous District Council. The press release which was purportedly signed by John F.Hmar, Secy, Info&amp;Pub., HPC(D) had alleged the CYMA as having made a resolution opposing the upgradation of Sinlung Hills Development Council to a status of Autonomous District, and demanded justification of the CYMA’s plan of executing its ‘Year Theme’ i.e. to safeguard Mizoram and Mizo tribe.  In its press release, the HPC(D) had also issued strong ‘diktat’ dissolving the entire branches of YMA within its demand area, and to submit all their seals to CYMA. The HPC(D) further warned of dire consequences to any branch of YMA who defies their order.  It is reported that a copy of the PR was found in a letter box at Aizawl press club earlier today. The YMA leaders were learnt to have reacted sharply and called an emergent CEC meeting today at 4:00pm. The meeting strongly condemned community based politics to divide Mizoram and also reacted the HPC(D) diktat to dissolve YMA branches within the demand area and informed all concerned YMA branches not to submit their respective seals to CYMA. The CEC meeting also agreed to talk to HPC(D) at the earliest convenient time to sort out their alleged misunderstanding.   Press release enclosed in Annexure- XVIII


 In response to the above PR, Central YMA had also issued press note No.CYMA 74/2011-2012/6 of 18.4.2012.   Press Note enclosed in Annexure- XIX
18.4.2012 HPC(D) Chairman H.Zosangbera sent an open letter to Pu T.Sangkunga, President CYMA.   The Open Letter is enclosed in Annexure-XX.

 In response to the above Open Letter, CYMA had also issued press note No.CYMA 74/2011-2012/6 of 20.4.2012.   Press Note enclosed in Annexure-XXI.
20.4.2012 Input received suggests that there is likelihood of the HPC(D) indulging themselves in unlawful activities in the near future to intimidate the YMA branches inside their demand area of Mizoram, in pursuance of its ‘diktat’ issued dt.17.4.12 for dissolution of all YMA branches within their demand area. As per the input received, SS Comdr. Lalbieklien has been entrusted to carry out the order. There are possibilities of the HPC(D) cadres either entering into Mizoram to carry out the order or intimidate the YMA leaders through phone calls.   The HPC(D) feels an urgent need of recruiting more cadres from Mizoram as they are convinced that their recent press release had hearted the sentiments of the Central YMA as well as the entire establishment.   In the meantime, the Central YMA are understood to be considering whether or not to visit Sakawrdai area as leaders of the YMA branches in the area are reportedly panic following the HPC(D)’s intimidation.

24.4.2012 HPC(D) issued a PR today reiterated that they are still firm in their stand that unless CYMA approve Autonomous District Council for Hmar dominated areas and the languages of Hmar, Ralte, Lai, etc are accepted by CYMA as Mizo language. Solution of the current problem through dialogue would be meaningless and HPC(D) would do whatever it takes to safeguard the people.   PR enclosed in Annexure-XXII.

26.4.2012 Information received indicated that the HPC(D) had issued extortion of Village Councils within their demand areas in Kolasib district demanding Rs.10,000/- to Rs.30,000/-(depending on the number of VC members) and house tax @ Rs.500/- per household for families having Govt. servant and Rs.300/- per household for those without Govt. servant.   The letters which were printed in HPC(D) letterhead were purportedly signed by L.Bieka Hmar, SS Commander, Mizoram Command in one letter and by Alex JL.Hmar, Finance in another. The letters also warned of possible action for failure to pay their demand within this month.   It is reported that the extortion letters were received by VCs of Phaisen, Buhchangphai and Saiphai on 24.4.2012.   Demand letter enclosed in Annexure-XXIII.



30.4.2012 Information received indicated that the HPC(D) S/S Army Chief Ropuia has threatened to take action against leaders of YMA Branches within their demand area who fail to submit their seals or continue to exist in defiance of their diktat issued earlier to dissolve. The CYMA, in the meantime, are learnt to have decided not to make further effort towards holding talks with the HPC(D) for amicable solution on the current imbroglio, as they feel that the HPC(D) were not keen on holding friendly discussion on the matter.
8.5.2012 Information received indicated that the HPC(D) is likely to attack power-line connecting Mizoram from Manipur State, mainly from Loktak Hydel Project, somewhere near Jiribam. They may also intend to cause blast in one or two selected localities within Aizawl city. Report further suggested that bridges or culvert from Silchar to Aizawl of NH-54 would be targetted to cut off main supply line to Mizoram.

15.5.2012 An E-Mail was received by Lallenmawia Jongte Publisher-cum- Editor “Hunthar” daily newspaper. The E-Mail was sent by John F.

Though type of vehicle or registration number could not be ascertained, it is most likely that the hired vehicle would be a 4-wheel drive as he is to follow a rough terrain on Tipaimukh road via Thanlawn.   He would be travelling on this hired vehicle upto Tipaimukh from where he would proceed further by boat upto Kangrengdawr. Input suggests there is also possibility of his taking hill route from Parbung via Tualbung – Maulien – Kangreng.

1.8.2012 The HPC(D) has issued a press release today Dt. 01.08.2012 which was posted in Facebook page ‘Special Report’ and ‘Virthli’. In its press release, the HPC(D) strongly resented the arrest of their leaders namely H.Zosangbera, S/S Chairman on Dt. 17.07.2012 at IGI airport, New Delhi and Lalropuia S/S Army Chief and Biaknunga S/S Dy Army Chief on Dt. 10.06.2012 at Silchar Airport. Alleging the Govt. of Mizoram as violating the SoO signed between the Govt. of Mizoram and HPC(D) on Dt. 11.11.2010 as well as the SoO signed between the Govt. of Assam and HPC(D), the press release stated that while its Chairman H.Zosangbera was on his way to meet officials of the Home Ministry, Govt. of India, its Army Chief Lalropuia and Dy Army Chief Biaknunga were on their way to visit the HPC(D) designated Camp and to attend a peace meeting with leaders of all party leaders (Mizoram).   Also refuting the accusations by the Govt. of Mizoram that HPC(D) were planning attacks on the people of Mizoram and disintegrating Mizoram, the HPC(D) in its press release asserted that their movement is not against any individual people or community but to secure Socio-Economic and political development of the Hmar in Sinlung Hills area.   The press release also stated that LT Hmar has been appointed as Chairman by its Emergency Executive Council meeting held recently. The press release was purportedly issued in the name of Amos P.Hmar, S/S Secretary, HPC(D).


6.8.2012 Input received suggested that the combined group of HPC(D) and BNA elements may carry out some unlawful activities such as abduction, targeting government officials or any civilian in or outside the state in the near future to secure the release of their leaders presently detained in Central Jail, Aizawl. As reported earlier vide our SR No. MSB/CB/SR/2012/497 dated 09.07.2012; this combined group may also resort to sabotage targeting railway track from Assam linking Bairabi and power supply lines.   According to fresh input received, the combined group has divided themselves into three groups with an attempt thereby to possibly launch some simultaneous attacks on soft targets such as passenger or goods carriers traveling along the Mizoram-Assam highway. In the meantime, the possibility of this group targeting our B.O.Ps in Saipum/Saiphai area in Kolasib district, and those of Tinghmun and Khawlian areas in Aizawl district cannot be ruled out.   Further considering their past activities, patrolling in certain areas such as Chhimluang and Vairengte located along the highway needs to be intensified as these places provide easy escape route through the jungle towards their jungle hideout located in Khawbawn forest in Mizoram-Assam border.

 2) Information received stated that the HPC(D) in what appears to be a retaliating act on the recent attempt by Mizoram Police to arrest CT Sungte S/S Dy Chief of Army at Zilthaw on dt. 24.07.2012, had served a notice to the temporary settlers of Zilthaw to leave the village before Dt. 15.08.2012.

Lalbiakzama, designated team leader representing the GoM presided the meeting. He welcomed and thanked the HPC(D) delegates for attending the dialogue and also appreciated the efforts of the HPC(D) in finding an amicable solution to the problems of the Hmar people in Mizoram.    LT. Hmar, working Chairman HPC(D) submitted the memorandum of the HPC(D) that was addressed to the Chief Minister of Mizoram. The same memorandum was also addressed to the GoM, the Union Home Minister and Jt. Secretary (North East), Govt. of India.    The HPC(D) memorandum termed the July 27, 1994 Memorandum of Settlement(MoS)/Peace Accord that was signed between the GoM and the HPC a hollow political instrument; and not accepted by the HPC(D). 19 years after signing of the MoS, it has proved to the world that the document holds no water and does not stand to fulfill the aspirations of the Hmar people to secure their political future.    In pursuance of the unfinished agenda of the Hmar people, the HPC(D) is committed to find a lasting, dignified and acceptable political solution to the Hmar’s aspirations with the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council in the State of Mizoram within the scope of the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. This will be of mutual benefit and based on the long term interest of both the Sinlung originated Hmar peoples and the GoM.    The HPC(D) remain fully and firmly committed not to seek separation from Mizoram but rather seek to find a permanent solution to the protracted Hmar issue in Mizoram, which is compatible with the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India. The HPC(D) firmly believes that to protect Hmar identity, culture, tradition, language, land, resources and to enhance political development and democratic decentralization in Mizoram, the only pragmatic option lies in the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council.    HOC(D) advocates a long term solution that addresses and ends the political marginalization suffered by the Hmar people in Mizoram. It also believes that no solution will lead to enduring peace if it is devoid of political justice and political will and it would not be just if it does not promote and enhance the political aspirations of the Hmar peoples.    The HPC(D) demands that the Union Government of India and the Government of Mizoram make sincere, committed and concerted efforts to fulfill the aspirations of the Hmar peoples. The unfinished agenda should be politically settled in accordance with the Constitution of India with the following objectives:







   1. To initiate tripartite dialogue involving the Govt. of India, Govt. of Mizoram and the Hmar Peoples Convention-Democratic for the creation of Hmar Autonomous District Council within the State of Mizoram.       2. To provide constitutional safeguards and protection to the Autonomous body as under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.

   In the course of the dialogue, the issue of further extension of SoS which is due to expire in July 2013 was raised by Team Leader representing the GoM. The HPC(D) leaders firmly maintains its stands that any furhther extension of SoO should be intricately linked with fixation of definite timeline for political dialogue within the month of July 2013. The talks met a stalemate as it was submitted by the HPC(D) delegates that the issue of further extension of SoO also require prior consultation and decision of the HPC(D) council.    The HPC(D) strongly felt that extension of SoO in Mizoram has no meaning if the prospect for a meaningful political dialogue is not put in place. The democratic interests and aspirations of the Hmar people should not be down played by a negligent and irresponsible delay tactics. The Hmar’s aspirations is to justly secure the Constitutional promises, which otherwise has marginalized us.

It is a serious violation of the ‘Agreed Ground Rules for implementation of Suspension of Operation (SoO)’ on the part of HPC (D) as the HPC (D) failed to abide by the Agreement. 12.7.14 Information has been received that, on 12.7.2014 afternoon, Pu Biakthansanga, Village Council President (VCP), Chiahpui village (located near Mizoram-Manipur border), Mizoram received a phone call from one person who claimed himself as L.C.

 Pu Biakthansanga, Village Council President (VCP), Chiahpui village also said that, in this regard, he received Demand Letter (extortion letter) from HPC(D) and the matter has already been brought to the notice of 2nd IR Bn. BOP at Khawdungsei, Mizoram.

28.7.14 HPC(D) claimed responsibility for the recent bomb explosion on 22.7.14 at Bungkawn Vengthar, Aizawl where the explosion had badly damaged Mizoram Police vehicle which was parked near the private building(under construction) of Pu Hmingchungnunga, Chairman, Sinlung Hills Development Council(SHDC).

13.9.14 Input had been received that Pu Lalthantlinga, Range Officer, Environment &amp; Forest Dept., Saitual had received an SMS on the night of 13.09.2014 @ 8:46pm from an unknown person who reportedly identified himself as John-a, S/S Action Commander of HPC(D) from mobile no-8414876722. The caller had demanded Rs. 3 (three) lakhs. The caller had also threatened the Range Officer not to divulge anything about the extortion demand or else he would be eliminated.

Upon enquiry, the Range Officer (RO) had disclosed that the extortionist had again called him last night, i.e. 14.09.2014 @ 9:30pm suggesting payment of the amount through bank account. The RO however told him that he did not have the amount demanded at the moment and suggested payment may be made in installments. At this juncture, the caller had told the R.O that he would call him back on 19.09.2014 after consultation with his superiors.

The RO further disclosed that he had, on earlier occasion, paid Rs. 2 (two) lakhs during June, 2014. He stated that the extortionist had instructed him to handover the cash to Pu Bawiha, VCP of Khawlian. However, when the RO went there to hand over the cash, the VCP had gone somewhere and had handed over the cash to Pu Liansanga, church elder (BCM), as instructed by the VCP. The RO stated further that he had also received acknowledgement call from the extortionist over payment of the said Rs. 2 lakhs.

26.9.14 Input received indicated that the HPC(D) had made extortion demands to various Retailers, Village Councils, contractors and some Government servants in Sakawrdai, Khawlian, Darlawn and Suangpuilawn area. Input suggests that a contractor (Mobile no. 8729918649 whose identity is yet to be ascertained), who is known to be doing construction of Police Quarters at New Vervek O.P, has agreed to pay a certain amount of money to the HPC(D) 2nd in-charge of Hmar Bial area, who is also identified as S/S Sgt. Chuailova.

It may be recalled that SDO, P&amp;E Dept. Darlawn and Range Officer of Forest Dept., Saitual had been receiving such extortion demands recently.

The HPC(D) normally make extortion demands through mobile phones asking the V/Cs to hand over the money to them on Manipur side.

Given the scenario of the extortion spree by HPC(D) inside Mizoram from across their hideout in Manipur, it is imperative to adopt measures to check and prevent these extortion activities.

23.10.2014 Hmar Peoples’ Convention-Democrat (HPC-D) issued a press release on 23.10.2014 condemning the frequent demands of ransom from Village Councils and Departments under the Government in Northern parts of Mizoram. The HPC(D) claimed that their organization never indulged in such unhealthy activities.

24.11.14 The HPC(D) (Sangbera’s faction) has issued a diktat expressing its desire that no Political party within their demand area should file nomination for the upcoming Village Council (VC) Election 2015. The HPC(D) has directed Village Councils within their demand area to form a common candidate in their respective villages instead. An unsigned letter typed in a Letter-head of HPC(D) Army wing bearing the name as ‘Bieka Hmar’ Area Commander, and the date as 16.11.2014 was received by VCs of Saipum and Saiphai Villages on 22.11.2014 in which the HPC(D) had also expressed strong resentment on the Government of Mizoram and NGOs for their alleged discrimination against the Hmar Community.

  Another group of HPC(D) (Sangbera’s faction) cadres numbering 12 (twelve) armed with sophisticated weapons had infiltrated into Tinghmun village on the night of 22.11.2014. The group first approached the VCP who arranged a vehicle (Sumo Maxi cab) MZ 01D 9774 driven by Materema as requested by the HPC(D) and entered a Labour camp located about 5(five) kilometres towards Sakawrdai side @ 02 : 00 am (23.11.2014). The group then handed over an extortion letter demanding 10% of the estimated amount from the contractor, Pu Malsawmdawngliana s/o V. Neihkunga of Chanmari, Aizawl who is doing road construction works between Sakawrdai and Tinghmun. The letter is hand-written in HPC(D) letter-head purportedly signed by L.Hmar, and the amount to be paid before 10th December 2014. It is reported that 8(eight) Workers including Pu Lalhmingtana of Sakawrtuichhun, Aizawl Manager of the road construction were staying at the camp on that night. The group had taken 220 Gelatin sticks (approx) along with 100 detonators and also snatched all mobile phones of the workers. The mobile phones were however returned through the VCP of Tinghmun @ 09:00 am after the group left the village.

   It is also reported that the group was led by S/S Sgt Maj Lalbieklien and Ex-Const Malsawmkima 1st MAP (deserter). The group after having morning meal at the VCP’s house left Tinghmun in another Pik-up belonging to a Bengali trader upto Zokhawthiang. It is learnt further that the group left towards Manipur side via Tuiruang river after a brief meeting with VCP of Zokhawthiang.

  Police party led by SDPO Sakawrdai had visited Tinghmun village this morning and the situation is reportedly normal. BOP’s within HPC(D) demand area need to be alerted.

1.12.14 Regarding diktat issued by HPC(D) on 24.11.14 instructing Village Councils to form common candidates for the upcoming VC election 2015, it is learnt that similar letters have been received by various VCs of Tuivawl constituency recently. The letters were purportedly signed by ‘Siama Hmar’, who is believed to be S/S Sgt, Maj. Thangsiem, Area commander. They also demanded Rs 10,000/- to be sent to village Elders of Sihpuikawn, Manipur before 15th December 2014 positively. It is reported that no VC has so far paid the extortion demand.   It is also reported that in some villages, the outfit(HPC-D) leaders had contacted village leaders through telephone and asked them to hand over the demand money through Pu Lalhmangaihzuala, Vice President, New Vervek Village Council. So far, no report on such transaction has been received and the situation is kept under close watch.   There were also inputs about the presence of a group of HPC(D) cadres numbering about 15(fifteen) led by S/S Thangsiem in Parbung/Senvon areas. BOPs along Manipur border areas therefore needs to be alerted.

2.12.14 Information has been received that HPC-D (H. Zosangbera Faction) has threatened Organizing Committee Members of ZOFEST with dire consequences if they go ahead with holding ZOFEST within Hmar dominated locality i.e. Mualhawih, Haflong, Assam where ZOFEST is scheduled to be held.

They also directed to submit the demand money for the month of December,2014 on or before 10.12.2014. The extortion notes were purportedly signed by ‘L. Hmar’, Area Commander and were received by both Saiphai and Saipum village council leaders on 2.12.2014. In this connection, Vairengte PS C/No.72/14 dt.4.12.14 u/s 121/120(B)/384/506 IPC has been registered.

9.2.15 On 9.2.2015 @ 6:00 p.m, 7 (seven) cadres of HPC(D) armed with sophisticated weapons AK-47, INSAS rifles etc. entered Khawpuar village under Sakawrdai Police Station. The HPC(D) cadres first approached Pu Zoremthanga, Vice President, Village Council, Khawpuar and instructed him to call his colleagues, retailer and school teachers of the village. Accordingly, 4 (four) school teachers, 1 (one) retailer, 3 (three) members of Village Council Khawpuar, and a Village Crier (Tlangau) gathered in the house of Pu Zoremthanga. The HPC(D) cadres demanded Rs 50,000/- to Village Council leaders, Rs 20,000/- to retailer and 5% of one month’s salary to school teachers. Accordingly, Village Council leaders gave Rs 7,000/- to HPC(D) cadres and the retailer also gave Rs.10,000/- to HPC(D) cadres. However, the school teachers could not give the demand of HPC(D) cadres as they have not yet received their salaries.    After having dinner in the residence of Pu Zoremthanga, VCP @ 11:30 p.m. The HPC(D) cadres stayed for a while in the village and they opened blank fire ( about 22 shots) in the air as they left the village at about 1:00 a.m (10.2.2015). Although, the identities of these HPC(D) cadres could not be ascertained as of now, it is strongly believed that they were the group led by S/S Sgt. Major Thangsiem, Commander and S/S Sgt.Chuailova, 2nd i/c who are active in Parbung/Senvon areas inside Manipur.    On hearing the infiltration of these HPC(D) cadres, Mizoram Police party numbering @ 25 personnel under the command of SDPO Sakawrdai immediately rushed to Khawpuar in the morning of 10.2.2015 to enquire the incident and a criminal case is being registered at Sakawrdai Police Station.    Further, input received suggests possible infiltration of HPC(D) cadres at the following villages - Mauchar, Vaitin, Zohmun and Khawlian in the near future, BOP’s in the areas.  19.2.2015 Reliable information received from source stated that a group of armed HPC(D) led by S/S Sgt. Biakliana are planning to infiltrate into Mizoram in the near future, possibly within the next 1 or 2 days.  Intelligence input suggests that they may target Saipum BOP, or may also enter Mauchar village via Dolakhal along Tuirial River.    While activities of this group are being closely monitored through both Technical Surveillance system and Human intelligent, it is highly imperative to adopt some proactive measures like laying ambush etc. along their possible entry route.
