****FREE MOVEMENT REGIME (FMR)****

  Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that allows free movement of Indian and Myanmarese citizens within 16 km of the border without Visa restrictions for 72 hours. Its purpose is to alleviate insecurity of tribals living along India and Myanmar Border as they still continue to have trans-border linkages with their kiths and kins. This regime has been in place to protect traditional social relations among border people. It helps genuine people living in the close proximity of the border. India and Myanmar shares 1,629.5 kms. unfenced border along four states viz. Arunachal Pradesh (520 kms), Nagaland (215kms), Manipur (398 kms) and Mizoram (496.531 kms) and permit free movement regime upto 16 km beyound border. In January 2018, Union Cabinet had approved agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) between India and Myanmar on land border crossing to enhance economic interaction between people of the two countries.

However, the Ministry of Home affairs said that it is misused by militants and criminals who smuggle weapons, narcotics, contraband goods and Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN). The statement issued by the ministry of home affairs went on to add that with fast improving security situation in this region, militants are denied hideouts here and some of them have relocated themselves across the border. Taking advantage of the free-movement regime occasionally they enter India, commit crimes and escape to their relatively safer hide-outs.

On 08.02.2024, the Hon’ble Home Minister of India had announced the decision of Ministry of Home Affairs regarding scrapping the Free Movement Regime and construction of border fencing along the Indo-Myanmar Border to ensure internal security of India and to maintain the demographic structure of North Eastern States bordering Myanmar.

On the other hand, the recent Mizoram Assembly unanimously adopted an official resolution opposing the Centre’s decision to scrap the Free Movement Regime(FMR) in the Mizoram sector of the India-Myanmar border and proposed erection of fencing along the same. Moving the official resolution, State Home Minister Pu K.Sapdanga stated that they do not want lifting of the FMR and fencing of Mizoram-Myanmar border and appeal to the Centre not to proceed with it.

  Mizoram shares 496.531 kms long border with Myanmar which is unfenced and porous, Six Districts of the State such as Champhai, Serchhip, Hnahthial, Lawngtlai , Siaha and Saitual District shares border with Myanmar. Of the six Districts, Champhai shares the longest border with Myanmar.

 Due to the lack of manpower and porous nature of the IMB, formal border pass/ travel documents as prescribed by the Committee on FMR are not issued to the people crossing the border at the IMB. Also, there is no system in place to check or regulate crossing beyond 16 kms into the Indian territories.

 However, random entry of names and particulars of people crossing the IMB is made at Zokhawthar Police Check Gate.
