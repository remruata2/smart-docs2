 Information has been received that Central Young Mizo Association (CYMA) is convening an Emergency CEC meeting tonight, i.e. 11.6.2019 @ 7:30 p.m at their office. The main agenda for the meeting is reportedly regarding the Press Release issued by MPSOA on 9.6.2019 in connection with the altercation between Supply Reduction Service (SRS), CYMA and some youths of Ramhlun South on 1.6.2019 and the allegation of Const. Zonunmawia of Bawngkawn PS as being intoxicated while dealing with the altercation between the two parties in front of Bawngkawn PS. The said Press Release stated that the Constable was free from substance abuse or drunkenness and this was proved the same evening using breathalyser test. The PR alleged that the post on social media was made by some undesirable individuals in an attempt to create misunderstanding between Police and SRS who have been working closely in fighting the menace of drugs within the State.

 Information received further indicated that SRS members were not pleased with the said Press Release and conveyed their discontentment to the leaders of CYMA which further results in convening of an Emergency CEC meeting.

 Situation under close watch.
