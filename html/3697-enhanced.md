****ARMS & AMMUNITIONS TRAFFICKING IN MIZORAM****

The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful. Although peaceful, Mizoram is surrounded by countries and states which are having many disturbances with respect to insurgency and terrorism. The porous international border areas and peaceful atmosphere of Mizoram have unfortunately served as preferred routes for insurgent groups and other criminal elements to smuggle arms, ammunition and contraband drugs, etc.

**Mizoram is having a stretch of approximately **510 Kms. and 318 Kms. porous International borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively**. Further, the ‘Act East Policy’ actively pursued by the Central Government and the State Government is bound to bring our International/foreign neighbours closer to our Country in general and Mizoram in particular. Again, the construction of Kaladan Multi Modal Transit Transport Project and Highway project to connect Myanmar from southern part of Mizoram is in full progress. The aforesaid factors would definitely affect the commercial activities of stakeholder countries to a great extent and thereby creating opportunities for smuggling all kinds of contraband goods/items. This angle requires effective handling and control at all cost by strengthening intelligence network, constant vigil &amp; surveillance, frequent patrolling, manning regular check posts, etc.**

**Mizoram, being located in a strategic point with foreign countries with porous international borders, has been vulnerable to many Insurgent groups, arms and drugs smugglers to transit their arms and ammunitions and also contraband goods. However, due to the sustained efforts by Mizoram Police, during the **last 23 years (wef. 1995 till date)** as many as **766 sophisticated weapons/arms** and about **48,950 ammunitions** were recovered from various arms smugglers and insurgent groups which clearly highlighted the vulnerability of the State as a transit route for arms smuggling.**

Besides, contraband goods coming from Myanmar side and illegally entering into Mizoram through Myanmar - Mizoram border side has also negatively affected the economic growth of the State. The recent increase in the smuggling of one new type of drugs, Pseudoephedrine coming from mainland India into Myanmar side through Mizoram State has called for immediate and proper attention and Mizoram Police has made constant efforts to affect several recoveries.

The main entry points of arms smuggling includes Hnahlan, Vapar, Ngur, Zote, Zokhawthar, Saikhumpai and Farkawn villages which are in Champhai District, bordering Myanmar in the east. Other routes of these contraband items are Marpara of Mamit District and Tlabung of Lunglei District, both of which shares international border with Bangladesh and Sangau bordering Myanmar can also be considered as entry points.

As mentioned earlier, arms smugglers took advantages of the peaceful atmosphere of Mizoram where security are lax as compared to other neighbouring militant infested states. As such, several arms consignments intercepted inside Mizoram are meant for underground outfits of the neighbouring state such as DHD (Dima Hasao Daogah), JSS (Jana Samhati Samity) etc. Apart from these, arms and ammunitions are also smuggled in or through Mizoram for sales to civilian guns enthusiast which are often sold in the black market at hefty prices.
