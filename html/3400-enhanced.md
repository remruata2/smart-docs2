**High Security Registration Plate (HSRP)****:**Answering the question of Vanglaini, heads of Traffic Police said that there is no section in MV Act to punish non-users of HSRP, they expect that Government to improvise rules to punish the offenders. LR Dingliana, Aizawl SP said that use of HSRP will not help in recovering lost/stolen vehicles, and the holograms were usually cut-off in the recovered vehicles which used HSRP. He also said that after the use of HSRP, there is no vehicle recovered with the help of HSRP.

 Meanwhile, R.Remmawia, Joint Director of Transport Department said that though there is no separate act to punish those who do not use HSRP, the offenders can be punished under Section 179 of the Motor Vehicle Act. Lalrinzuala Pachuau, Asst. Director of Transport Department (IT Cell) told Vanglaini that HSRP is only number plate security and not vehicle security, and it is not meant for the prevention of missing/losing vehicles, but could be helpful in tracing out the lost vehicles.
