**SECURITY RELATED ISSUES**

1. Presently, the PLA (Manipur based insurgent group) is having permanent camp inside Myanmar adjacent to Mizoram. This matter needs to be discussed seriously with Myanmar government since the PLA are imparting training to various underground outfit of the Northeast. It has also been ascertained that different Northeast insurgent groups like UNLF, NDFB, ULFA and NLFT etc occasionally have meetings inside Myanmar and used Mizoram as a conduit for illegal movements and activities. Alertness must be maintained regarding this matter.

2. It may be reiterated that better sharing of intelligence inputs between the two sides needs to be emphasized especially along the Indo-Myanmar Border. As such, the establishment of Hotline between the intelligence agencies of the two Governments be given priority to combat the movement of insurgents, arms smugglers and drug traffickers etc.

3. The seizures of certain number of arms cache, narcotic drugs and Hides/skin of protected and endangered animals from time to time clearly indicated that Mizoram and Manipur states are being used as routes to smuggle arms, narcotics etc, to India vice versa and this unwanted infiltrations could only be checked or eliminated by the joint efforts of both Government. Therefore, Border posts in both sides need to be alerted and stringent actions be taken against such infiltrators.

4. Interrogation reports of captured insurgents, arms smugglers, drug traffickers may be shared uniformly at an early time to have better control of illegal and unwanted movements in the border.

**DRUGS TRAFFICKING**

 Illegal transportation of Narcotic drugs like Pseudoephedrine, Cetirizine, Methamphetamine, etc. is quite rampant. Transportation is often done from mainland India and Northeast state through Mizoram and Manipur and these narcotic drugs are meant for preparing highly abusive drug substances in Myanmar. Stringent preventive measures need to be taken in this regard and should also be one of the most priority subjects to be discussed in the meeting.
