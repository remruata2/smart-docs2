****R****eport on assessment of security threat perception in respect of****

****Pu R.Lalzirliana, Ex-Home Minister and Pu Hiphei, Ex-Speaker****

 Presently, Pu R. Lalzirliana Ex-Home Minister and Pu Hiphei, Ex-Speaker are having four(4) PSOs, 4 Constables and 2 NCOs as House Guards each. During the course of assessment on threat perception in respect of the aforesaid Ex-MsLA, it is learnt that several precautionary advices have been received by them as they were just inducted into MNF party and BJP party respectively. Further, the said two Ex-MsLA had received neither direct nor indirect threat from any angle (both in writing and verbally).

 Considering the overall peaceful scenario of the prevailing political situation with regard to the forthcoming General Election 2018, it is, therefore, adduced that the provision of House Guards and four (4) PSOs each to the aforesaid Ex-MsLA is no longer required and hence, House Guards of Pu R. Lalzirliana, Ex-Home Minister and Pu Hiphei, Ex-Speaker may be withdrawn and that the provision of PSOs also may be reduced/scaled down as deemed necessary or as per scale.
