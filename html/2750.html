However right from the beginning, the MBDPF leaders started taking steps which came in the way of the repatriation process. The first step of such kind was the awareness campaign in the refugee camps like Naisingpara, Asapara, Hazachera on 8.1.2006 by leaders viz. Laldawngliana, A. Sawibunga and Bruno Msha to convince the general public to object repatriation unless the GoM agreed to the following demands :-</span></span></span></p>

The MBDPF leaders who delivered speeches viz. Elvis Chorky, Chairman MBDPF, Laldawngliana, Gen. Secy. and A. Sawibunga, Treasurer, among many others points stressed 1 year free ration, repatriation not to be under dictated terms of GoM, MoU between Mizoram and BNLF was not enough to safeguard the Bru people and their strong objection to be resettled in their respective old villages. A memorandum containing 16 charters of demand was submitted to Prime Minister of India through BDO Dosda, N. Tripura giving a copy to Union Home Minister Shivraj Patel, Chief Minister Mizoram, Joint Secretary NE Affairs Unit, India.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt">Inspite of the negative response of the MBDPF leaders, the Govt. of Mizoram was actively considering the repatriation of the displaced Brus and examine their 16 points charter of demands. Meanwhile it was felt necessary to strongly deal with the then militant outfit, the BLFM which posed threat and hardship for the smooth flow of repatriation. There was internecine rivalry amongst the leadership of BLFM which led to the successful operation leading to the arrest of the top brass leaders like President Vanlalliana and others on Dt. 20.4.2006 which was closely followed by surrendering of the remaining leadership led by Zoramthanga V/President and Lalrinkima Molshoy, Gen. Secretary and other high ranking officers of the army setup. The intelligent operation against the BLFM finally culminated into the surrendering of the 804 strong BLFM cadre led by Lalthazuala, then communication secretary of BLFM on 26th October, 2006.</span></span></span></p>

Contrary to the initiative of the Govt. of Mizoram for repatriation, the MBDPF also revived their struggle for early repatriation in a negative manner i.e one week sit-in-demonstration in front of Raj Bhawan, Agartala with effect from 22.2.2007 which was followed by indefinite hunger strike with effect from 2.3.2007. The hunger strike was called off on 6.3.2007 only after the visit of Naveen Verma, Joint Secretary, MHA who conceded most of the demands amongst the 16 points of their charter of demand. Four points were kept pending to be discussed with Govt. of Mizoram. </span></span></span></p>

Road map for their repatriation prepared by the Govt. of Mizoram was discussed at length which the MBDPF raised objection on some points which were also discussed points by points. However, when process for their repatriation was due to start on 16.11.2009, Zarzokima s/o Lalngilneia of Bungthuam was shot dead about 1 Km north of Bungthuam village by unidentified persons on 13.11.2009.

Widespread communal violence in the western belt of Mizoram causing many people homeless prompted the Govt. to form a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate this sensational case. The SIT successfully unearthed the reason behind the killing due to which the alleged mastermind of this sensational case. R. Laldawngliana, V/President, MBDPF was arrested on 23.1.2010. The arrested person did not deny that the incident was made to stall repatriation process to kickstart from 16.11.2009.</span></span></span></p>

Apart from awareness campaign to the general public, some extremist leaders instructed the so called Bru militant group to cause incident either in the district of Mamit or Kolasib which could prevent the smooth process of Bru refugee repatriation culminating in the unprovoked firing of one innocent Mizo youth causing major law and order problem in the western belt of Mizoram just before the road map was activated. </span></span></span></p>

Whenever the Govt. proposed to start the process, all kinds of fresh demands used to be added which call for fresh discussion not only for the Govt. of Mizoram but with the Central Govt. Based on intelligence sources and visible material evidence, the reason behind the reluctance of MBDPF leaders to welcome repatriation process is simple; they amassed wealth at the expense of Bru refugees and majority of their leaders were purchasing one or two vehicles including luxury car and commercial vehicles like Car or Jeep and even 207 model for their business. </span></span></span></p>

No one could be blamed for making such a conclusion considering the standard of living of the leaders in the Refugee camp.</span></span></span></p>
