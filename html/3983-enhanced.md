No. MSB/CB/B-19(A)/    Dated Aizawl, the May, 2025

To 

 The Under Secretary

 to the Government of Mizoram

 Home Department

Subject: Assessment report of threat perception.

Sir

 Kindly refer to your letter No.D.32019/1/2024-HMS dated 24.04.2025, I am submitting herewith assessment report of threat perception in respect of the following Posts of MJS Officers Grade-I:-

  

i) Legal Remembrancer-cum-Secretary, Law &amp; Judicial Department

ii) Presiding officer, Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal

iii) Registrar, Gauhati High Court (Aizawl Bench)

iv) Member Secretary, Mizoram State Legal Services Authority

  

  All the above mentioned posts are occupied by MJS Grade-I Officers and these MJS Officers had gone through several sensitive postings as CJMs, Addl. District &amp; Session Judge, District &amp; Session Judge, Judge, Special Court ND &amp; PS Act, Special Judge and Prevention of Corruption Act, etc.

 During their tenure in Courts, they had tried innumerable and multifarious sensational cases as well as delivered severe sentences. These convicted accused ranging from hard core criminals engaged in the business of organized crime particularly related with illegal smuggling of narcotic drugs to high ranking government officials indulging in corruption cases. These criminals having well connected networks within the society while some, whose linkages transcend beyond borders. There are often instances where these Judicial Officers encountered their convict in public and unfavourable places, who were either out on parole or acquitted by the High Court. Such circumstances caused uneasiness and insecurity on the part of the MJS Grade-I Officers and threat continues to persist due to their past postings and very much perceived by them.

 

 It is therefore suggested that providing PSOs to the aforementioned Posts of the Judicial Officers would minimize the chances of untoward incident against them as they continues to be potential targets. Moreover, the presence of PSOs would act as the deterrent from convicted criminals and their networks.

  Submitted for favour of your kind perusal and further necessary action please.

 Yours faithfully
