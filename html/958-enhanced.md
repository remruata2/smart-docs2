**Mizoram-Bangladesh:**

BSF is entrusted to guard the Mizoram-Bangladesh border. Mizoram has no boundary dispute/issues with Bangladesh. Border Fencing is in progress. Being a porous border and due to socio – cultural affinities between people residing in both sides of the border, there exist frequent movement of people across the border. Border trade is also being carried out at various locations.

Recently, 2 (two) Bangladeshi nationals, namely (i) Mahmud Hassan (25) s/o Gulbarg Ali, Magura, Bangladesh and (ii) MohamadSayadHussain (35) s/o ShayaibHussain, Magura, Bangladesh were apprehended by BSF personnel stationed at Silsuri BOP on ground of suspicion of involvement in anti-national activities and produced before Marpara PS and C/No.7/19 u/s 471/476 IPC r/w 14 A(b) Foreigners Act was registered.

**2. Boundary Issue with Assam and other Neighbouring States:**

****Inter-State border Issues with Assam:****

The boundary issue with Assam is a long pending impasse for Mizoram. The recent issues are as follows:

On 27.2.2018, MizoZirlai Pawl (MZP) constructed "Zofate Chawlhbuk" (Shed) at Zophai, near Bairabi located at Mizoram-Assam border but the same was demolished by some person(s) on the same night. Similarly, Police Duty Post erected by Assam Police at the same disputed site on 2.3.2018 was also dismantled by some persons a few hours after it was constructed.

Consequently, on 12.4.2018, Joint Verification Team, comprising of officials from Mizoram and Assam started conducting spot verification of Inner Line Reserve Area along Mizoram-Assam border. It was reported that a total of 34 (thirty four) illegal constructions, including 2 (two) Masjids and 1 (one) School, were identified by the Joint Verification Team. Out of the total 34 illegal constructions, 1 (one) illegal construction was owned by Sangluaia (L) of Bairabi, Mizoram while the rest were owned by residents of Assam.

MZP General Hqrs. decided to pull out of the Core Committee which was set-up to conduct Survey on the actual Boundary on 3.8.2018 as they felt that the Core Committee was unable to make any conclusive report within the stipulated time.

On 6.4.2019 officials from Assam Forest Department started renovation work of one building located at the disputed Mizoram-Assam Forest Reserve area along the Aizawl- Silchar National Highway and reported that the building was occupied on the same night. Meanwhile, one platoon from 1st IR Bn. of Mizoram Police also occupied old BRTF camp which was approximately 100m from the existing Mizoram Police Check Gate which was highly welcomed and supported by civilians.

Council of Ministers meeting held on 8.7.2019 upheld the Cachar Inner Line, 1875 as enacted as per Section 2 of Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations, 1873 (Regulation 1 of 1873) as the basis for settlement of border issues.

Recapping past development, on 3.9.2015, a meeting between District Administration of Kolasib, Mizoram and Cachar, Assam was held at CIJWS Conference Hall, Vairengte and resolved that Status Quo ante shall be maintained in the respective Forest Areas. No department activity/encroachment by any department or public shall be allowed. In case of any illegality which is in violation of the Forest Act/Rules/Regulations in force, the matter shall be brought immediately to the notice of the counterpart Range Officers/ Divisional Forest Officers. DC Level Meeting was held between DC Kolasib and DC Hailakandi on 26.8.2019 @ 11:00 a.m at Bairabi, Kolasib District, Mizoram. The meeting discussed 3 (three) mains issues concerning both the districts:

1. Inner Line Pass.
2. Free Movement of local farmers.
3. Reconstruction of Masjid at Zophai/Kachurtal.

After careful deliberations, the meeting resolved the following points:

1. The committee cannot come to conclusion as to whether the Masjid construction has to be stop or removed as both the parties have their own concerns. However, it was decided that the matter be taken up at the Government level. In the meantime, construction work of permanent nature is to be discontinued/not taken up until decision is taken at the Government level.
2. In case any new activity is proposed to be taken up in the disputed area, both the districts should be informed prior consent and no action is to be taken without the consent of both the districts.
3. Coordination Committee comprising of members from both the districts be constituted involving officials including Panchayat/Village Council Members and NGOs.
4. Free movement of local farmers in the disputed area should be ensured by both the districts.
5. The committee agreed to meet after 3 (three) months to review the progress of the decision arrived at today’s meeting.

After the meeting, officials of both sides visited Masjid reconstruction site wherein it was reiterated by Kolasib District Officials that reconstruction of Masjid is a clear violation of an agreement to maintain status quo in the dispute area.

**5. Status of Free Movement Regime (FMR) – Points of FMR Finalised:**

Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that allows free movement of Indian and Myanmarese citizens within 16 km of the border without Visa restrictions. Its purpose is to alleviate insecurity of tribals living along India and Myanmar Border as they still continue to have trans-border linkages with their kiths and kins.

India and Myanmar share 1,643 km unfenced border along four states viz. Arunachal Pradesh (520 km), Nagaland (215km), Manipur (398 km) and Mizoram (_404 km_) and permit free movement regime upto 16 km beyond border. In January 2018, Union Cabinet had approved agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) between India and Myanmar on land border crossing to enhance economic interaction between people of the two countries.

However, the Ministry of Home affairs said that it is misused by militants and criminals who smuggle weapons, narcotics, contraband goods and Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN). The statement issued by the ministry of home affairs went on to add that with fast improving security situation in this region, militants are denied hideouts here and some of them have relocated themselves across the border. Taking advantage of the free-movement regime occasionally they enter India, commit crimes and escape to their relatively safer hide-outs.

Mizoram shares 404 kms. long border with Myanmar. Five Districts of the State such as Champhai, Serchhip, Lunglei, Lawngtlai and Siaha District share border with Myanmar. Of the five Districts, Champhai shares the longest border with Myanmar.
