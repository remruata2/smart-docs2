ZWO submitted an FIR to Bairabi Police Station on Friday, ie., 15.2.2013 against the recent incidents in which the Cachar forest department allegedly seized teak logs from Mizo farmers and harassed them. </span></span></span></p>

Alleging that the Mizo families having paddy fields within the inner line forest have been facing difficulties and harassment from the cachar officials, the organisation exhorted the Mizoram government to take immediate steps to get back the land. The inner line reserve forest was put under the administration of the Assam&#39;s Cachar district forest, as gazette by the Assam government on October 17, 1878 under the Indian Forest Act, 1865. Now, it has gradually turned into a hub of Bangladeshi immigrants, including arm smugglers and terrorists.</span></span></span></p>
