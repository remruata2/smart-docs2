The meeting, which discussed about the various demands made by the Brus and the impending repatriation process, decided to either merge into a single organisation or select a representative body for all Bru organisations before holding talks with the Mizoram Government. They decided to return to their camps at Tripura where they will hold a joint meeting of MBDPF, MBDPCC, Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement (MBIDM) and Bru Tribal Development Society (BTDS) within this week and to further hold a public meeting as prescribed by that joint meeting. They will try to find a common ground and select representatives for a united single body which will represent the whole community which will then proceed to Aizawl to meet Pu Zoramthanga, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Mizoram and other dignitaries and officials of the Mizoram Government.

After the meeting, MBDPCC leaders left Aizawl for Tripura while MBDPF leaders will halt the night and return tomorrow, i.e. 22.02.2019. Both leaders of the organisations will be returning without meeting any dignitaries or Government officials.
