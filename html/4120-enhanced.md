****(a) Updates on development in Myanmar and Bangladesh having security implication in our territory (AR,BSF,SB/CID, Special Bureau, Military Int)****

**Myanmar** :

** **CNA/CDF**- Chinland Joint Defence Committee (CJDC) was formed on April 4, 2021 by the 17 (seventeen) factions of the Civil Defence Forces (CDF) in Chin State, Myanmar. In its initiative for the formation of Interim Government of Chinland, CJDC had decided to prepare a Constitutional Draft. In pursuance of CJDC decision, 'Future Chinland Constitutional Planning Workshop' was held during 7th - 8th September, 2023 at Central YMA Hall, Aizawl, Mizoram. The programme, which was presided over by Mr. Zing Cung, CNF Chairman, was attended by representatives from 16 (sixteen) factions and they had formed a Constitutional Drafting Committee comprising of 31 (thirty one) members. Mr. Ramkul Cung, CNF Assistant General Secretary, Mr. Tial Ling, MP and Salai Paul, CDF Paletwa were the Conveners of The Drafting Committee and the members consisted of 5 (five) representatives from CNF, 9 (nine) Members of Parliament, and 1 (one) representative each from CDF/PDF.**

 The Final Draft of the Constitution, drafted by the Constitution Drafting Committee was approved by the Working Committee for Chinland Council at a Conference held at Camp Victoria between 27.11.2023 to 1.12.2023.

 As mandated by the Constitution, Chinland Council was formed with the election of Chinland Council Leading Members and during 30th and 31st January 2024, Chinland Council Meeting was held at Camp Victoria, Chin State Myanmar.

 Chinland Government/Council, however, is not accepted by some of the ethnic armed group including CDF Mindat, PDF Zoland and CNO/CNDF which called themselves as Chinland Brotherhood. As a result, there is a a tension between Chinland Council, mainly CNA and Chinland Brotherhood. the possibility of cross fire between these groups could not be ruled out. Further, the tension between Chinland Council and ZRA backed by Myanmar Army is increasing and there is a possibility that CNA may attacked ZRA and Myanmar Army camped at Tedim.

 As for the refugee, information received of late stated that 7 (seven) families consisting of 25 (twenty five) Myanmar Nationals had recently entered Mizoram and reached Tuidangchhuah Village in Lawngtlai District on 25.04.2024. These Myanmar Nationals from the Khumi community are mainly residents of Paletwa Township and its surrounding areas and are currently living with their friends and families at Tuidangchhuah Village. With this latest report of Influx of Myanmar Nationals, the total number of Myanmar Refugees in Mizoram is currently recorded as 34307 (thirty four thousand three hundred and seven).

 These Myanmar nationals ,mainly Khumi tribe claimed to seek asylum in Mizoram consequent upon the Arakan Army taking over Paletwa Township and the subsequent inhumane treatment of the Khumi communities by the Arakan Army which however need further corroboration.

 It is reported that the Khumi National Defence Army (KNDA) did not appreciate the hoisting of Arakan Army flag at Paletwa Township. The Khumis had been claiming the areas of Paletwa Township as their ancestral home and latest inputs suggested that the Khumis from different part of the country are being recruited to join the Khumi National Defence Army (KNDA) to overthrow the Arakan Army from Paletwa Township.

The number of Myanmar Nationals seeking refuge in Mizoram is as follows:

*** Bangladesh Government - KNF dialogue:**

 After a series of online meeting, "First round of Physical Peace Talk" between Kuki-Chin National Front/Army (KCNA) and Government of Bangladesh (GoB) represented by the Peace Committee was held on 5th November, 2023 at Hmunlai village, near Ruma bazar, Bandarbun District, Bangladesh. Although no definite agreements were made, the meeting, agreed to maintained cease-fire between both the parties until the next peace talk. The KNF has submitted a draft of possible and proposed peace agreement with 6 (six) point demands to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh through Peace Establishment Committee. The second round of bilateral physical meeting between the two parties was conducted on 05.03.2024 at Bethel Para Community Centre in Ruma Upazila of Bandar district. This meeting marks a pivotal step towards resolving a conflict that has displaced hundreds and stoked tension in the region. The meeting spearheaded by Zilla Parishad with its 13 member delegation, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Kya Shew Hla, , discussed significant issues, including the release of KNF prisoners and the non-return of Bawm community members from Mizoram until a peace agreement is secured. The meeting not only reaffirmed the parties commitment to peace but also illustrated the potential for constructive dialogue in addressing longstanding issues. The next round of talks was scheduled to be held on 22.4.2024. However, the bank robberies of Bandarban Districts of Bangladesh conducted by KNA on 2.4.2024 have put all the efforts of the peace talks in question.

**Brief notes on the bank robberies :**

 On 2nd April, 2024 at around 9:30 p.m. of Bangladesh Time (BDT), around 25 (twenty five) armed cadres of Kuki-Chin National Army/ Kuki-Chin National Front (KNA/KNF) robbed Sonali Bank (one of the leading banks in Bangladesh) of Ruma Branch, Bandarban, Bangladesh. They looted about Takka 1 crore 58 lakhs from the bank taking more than an hour to complete the robbery.

 It is further learnt that 2 hours after the robbery, a gunfight took place between the cadres of KNA/KNF and Bangladesh Army at Khamtam Para of Rowangchari Upazila at 11:30 pm (BDT). In the incident, one Bangladesh Army soldier, Shafiqul Islam (25) received bullet injuries.

 S/S Colonel Solomon, Chief of Media and Intelligence Wing, Kuki-Chin National Front (KNF) in his supposedly justification of the incidents claimed that neither the Peace Establishment Committee or the Bangladesh Government is taking the demands of the KNF seriously and alleged the Bangladesh Government of not fulfilling any terms of the meeting.

**](b) Current trends in smuggling of narcotics drugs, arms, explosives, WLS and other contrabands :**

**Drug Smugglings:******

******Mizoram being geographically close to the Death Triangle and due to the porous unfenced international border with Myanmar became a frequented route for drug smugglers in recent years. Mizoram which also shares inter-state boundary with three other Indian states is also used as a gateway for trafficking of drugs and other contraband items from Myanmar to Mainland India. Also, the recent unrest in Myanmar causing the decline in the number of military check gates on the Myanmar side and the Myanmar Nationals seeking asylum in India acting as a peddlers/dealers to support themselves financially resulted in the increase of drug trafficking in Indo-Myanmar border. As communal violence occurred in Manipur, which was reportedly one of the major smuggling routes, smugglers could no longer used Manipur as their route; the peaceful state of Mizoram become more vulnerable to such smugglers.**

****Comparative drugs seizure by Mizoram Police during 2021 – 2023****

| **Name of Drugs** |  | **Seized Quantity** |  |  |  |

| Methamphetamine | 153.778 Kgs |  | 217.295 kgs | 203.176 kgs | 36.55kgs |
| Crystal Meth |  |  |  |  | 10.385 kgs |

On confronting the driver and his passenger of the i10 Car, they confessed of transporting narcotic drugs by the car from Myanmar and stated that the narcotics are hidden inside the door panel of the car and are about to hand over the narcotics to the passengers of the Venue Car. The operation team, after arranging civilian witnesses, seized 19 packet/bundles (approximately 19.66 kilograms) of Methamphetamine tablets from the joint possession of the i10 Car (MZ01F-9865) driver, Tanliana Tlaisun (34) s/o Khuangluaia of Khawmawi, Myanmar and his passenger, Biakluaia (28) s/o Thangsawna of Khawmawi, Myanmar at 11:00 p.m. and arrested them.

**(d) Any other inputs that can be actionable, or require immediate attention**-

 Reliable inputs received stated that all the leaders and cadres of KNA/KNF are still stationed in Bangladesh at the moment. However, if the Bangladesh Government conducted extensive combing exercises, as a result of the bank robberies carried out by KNF as mentioned above, the possibility of entry of KNA/KNF cadres or influx of refugees from Bangladesh into Mizoram in the near future could not be ruled out.
