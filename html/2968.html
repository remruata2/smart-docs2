Assam Regiment and Assam Rifles towards Southern Lawngtlai District from around 14/15.02.2019 onwards. The movement could not go unnoticed by the general population and so there was a huge speculation spread among the public through social media which also caused panic in some quarters as there has been continued reports of sporadic fighting between Myanmar Army (MA) and the Arakan Army (AA) on the other side of the border since last year. The claim of the security forces has been that they are conducting a joint routine exercise in the area. There were also reports of restrictions of movement of the villagers in the area by the security forces. Therefore, on the verbal instruction of DIG(CID), Pu C. Lalengliana, Dy.SP (Field), CID(SB) was sent from Aizawl on 20.02.2019 to visit the area, the southern part of Lawngtlai District bordering Myanmar, and take stock of the situation. </span></span></span></span></span></p>
