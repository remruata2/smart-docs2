**Proposed Agenda for 3rd Border Liaison Officer meeting**

1. **Cooperation to check Arms/Narcotic Smuggling:-**

 Mizoram being located at a strategic point in North East India with porous international borders, has been vulnerable and is often used as a conduit for transporting arms and ammunitions, drugs and contraband items by various Insurgent groups and Smugglers. However, due to the sustained efforts by Mizoram Police, during the last two years (i.e.2017 – 2019 till date) the following seizures were made:

1. As many as 27 sophisticated weapons and about 2761 ammunitions were recovered from various Arms smugglers which clearly highlighted the vulnerability of the State as a transit route for arms smuggling.

1. 104 Narcotic Cases were registered during the year 2018 to 2019 till date (Heroin-18.26 Kgs, Methamphetamine-166.313 Kgs, Pseudo-ephedrine-335 Kgs and Ganja-700 grams). Besides, contraband goods coming from Myanmar side and illegally entering into Mizoram through Myanmar – Mizoram border side has also negatively affected the economic growth of the State.

1. **Exchange of Intelligence Information :**

 Interrogation reports of captured/arrested cadres of Insurgent outfits, arms smugglers, drugs traffickers may be shared uniformly at an early time to have better control of illegal and unwanted movements in the border.

1. **Implementation of On-Going Development Projects:**

 Two big infrastructure projects viz. Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) and Barabi – Sairang - Hmawngbuchhuah railway line being implemented in Mizoram under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners across Mizoram from Myanmar and would also encourage illegal criminal activities across the border. Hence, there is a need to increase deployment of security forces in the areas.
