Subject: Security assessment report.

Sir,

 With reference to your letter No.MSB/CB/C-106/737 dt.16.9.2015, I beg to report that I have conducted assessment at Saipum, Saiphai, Phainuam, N.Chawnpui and Saihapui 'V' villages contacting the local leaders and political party leaders and my findings are as follows:

 1. At present, the Village Advisory Board comprising of five members from different political parties with C.A as Chairman (from Local Administration Department) function as Village Council.

 2. The present situation is peaceful and normal and no threat received from the outside elements so far.

 3. The villagers are willing to elect the members of Village Council. But, if there is threat from outside elements, the candidates may withdraw their nomination, in fear of the reaction of the outside elements.

 4. At present, the villagers did not have any intention of making request to the insurgent group to allow them to have Village Council Election.

 Submitted for favour of kind perusal and necessary action please.

Yours faithfully,

S.I (LALDUHSAKA)

Sector Officer
