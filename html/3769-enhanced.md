****BRU MILITANCY****

**Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF):**

The BNLF was formed in 1996 following violent clashes between ethnic Mizos and Reang tribesmen in the erstwhile Mamit Sub- Division of the state of Mizoram. The immediate cause of the conflict was the demand for an Autonomous District Council (ADC) by a political party called Bru National Union (BNU) which was formed in 1994. The resolution passed by the BNU for creation of separate Autonomous District Council for the Reangs/ Brus reportedly provoked Mizo organisations such as Young Mizo Association and Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) fearing geographical divisions of the State to organise violent attacks in October, 1997 on Reang Settlements. As a result, approximately 32,000 Reangs were displaced and have since been staying in refugee camps in Tripura, Kanchanpur District.

 The outfit proclaims its primary objective as the protection of rights and dignity of Reangs. They also endeavours to protect religious dignity of Reangs. Subsequently, they aimed to achieve a separate Autonomous District Council for Reangs. Later on, they agreed to tone down their demands from ADC and settle for a regional council.

**Incidents**

 Beginning its inception, it has led several violent attacks against ethnic Mizos as well as security force personnel.

**2012**

- April 4: SFs arrested five militants belonging to BNLF, from Baigunchherra in North Tripura District. The militants were identified as Pradip Piter (28), Juam Jhara Bru (28), Psamani Bru (28), Routijoy Reang (26) and Karanjoy Reang (22).

- January 17: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Mizoram Police arrested two militants who were involved in the November 13, 2009 killing of a Mizo youth, Zarzokima (18) of Bungthuam. They were identified as Vanlalfela and Chusarai _alias_ Lalrinfela. One seal bearing a 'logo' of the United Liberation Army (ULA) outfit and donation receipt were recovered from their possession. Mizoram Home Minister R. Lalzirliana said that ULA was involved in extorting money at areas of Tripura and Assam bordering Mizoram. He said, "They had even kidnapped businessmen from the plain areas for ransom". The report adds that Vanlalfela was a cadre of the BNLF and was involved in various crimes. Due to internal rivalry and tensions, Vanlalfela left the BNLF in 2005 and became a cadre of the Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM). He, along with 20 other BLFM cadres, refused to surrender when 802 strong cadres of the BLFM surrendered in 2006, the Mizoram Police said. Chisurai joined the BLFM in 2006.

Since we have no money to give to them, we are afraid these people would take action against our family members most of whom are still in Tripura in refugee camps."

An accord signed at Aizawl on 26.4.2005 between the Government of Mizoram and BNLF brought to an end the 8 year armed rebellion following the Oct, 1997 alleged ethnic cleansing drive which forced thousands of Brus out of the State. The MoU was signed on behalf of the State Givernment by Chief Secretary HV Lalringa while the BNLF was represented by Surjyamoni Reang, President, BNLF. The talk between the State Government and the BNLF began on September, 1999 and the formal negotiation officially began on 7th September, 2001.

Different Armed groups of the Brus- Bru National Army (BNA) /Bru Revolutionary Army (BRA) and BNLF or BLFM are not active anymore. However, a new group Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM) was again formed recently under the patronage of NLFT. These BDFM cadres are mainly responsible for the heinous crimes which occurred in the western border areas of Mizoram during the recent past which included kidnapping for ransom, burglary of Government offices, etc.

**BRU DEMOCRATIC FRONT OF MIZORAM (BDFM):**

 BDFM are the remnants of the erstwhile BLFM who refused to surrender at the time of the later’s mass surrender on 20.10.2006. They formerly call themselves as Bru Revolutionary Army (BRA), Bru Liberation Army(BLA) etc. They seem to have no concrete aims and objectives and are more likely to be an armed gang rather than a well organized militant group.

A group numbering seven of BDFM armed with AK-47 and small arms have crossed Bangladesh border near Zopui at 6:30am on 9.2.2014 with a plan to carry out extortion inside Bru refugee camps. The groups are likely to infiltrate into Bru refugee camps only with camps only with small arms via Thailihpara under Anando Bazar P/S jurisdiction, N.Tripura, and the group is learnt to have demanded deduction of funds meant for refugee aid @ Rs.10/- per adult and Rs.5/- per minor per month. The BDFM is a group known to be involved in several abduction cases inside Mizoram and Tripura during recent past, based in Tarunpara jungles (Bangladesh) under the active patronage of NLFT.  6. Input received indicated that the Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM) is planning to disrupt the proposed repatriation of Bru refugees. The input received suggests possible plot by the outfit to carry out abduction targeting Mizos in the western belt of Mamit District in the near future.   The threat came in the wake of the commitment made by the State Government's to the NGO Co-ordination Committee to delete those Bru refugees from Mizoram Electoral Roll who fail to return to Mizoram even after repeated appeals.  |
