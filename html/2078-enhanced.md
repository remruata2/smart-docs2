**BRIEF NOTE ON MIZORAM INSURGENCY PROBLEMS**

**Introduction:**

In term of Insurgency related incidents, Mizoram can undoubtedly be regarded as one of the most peaceful state in india. The 20-year long insurgency in Mizoram (1966-86) led by the Mizo National Front (MNF) was resolved way back in 1986. However, after the end of 20-year insurgency of Mizoram some armed groups of Hmars i.e Hmar People’s Convention (HPC) and armed group of Brus (reang) i.e Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF), Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram(BLFM) took armed struggle movement in Mizoram undermining the peaceful atmosphere of the state of Mizoram.

**Bru Militancy in Mizoram**

_Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) :_

The BNLF was formed in the month of April 1997 with an objective of creating an Autonomous District Council within the Bru inhabited areas of Mamit District in the western part of Mizoram. The first heinous crime committed by the BNLF was killing of Lalzawmliana, a Forest Game Watcher at Persang village in Dampa Forest Sanctuary in Mamit District. The BNLF thereafter resorted to violent activities such as ambush of Security forces, extortions, kidnappings and arsons. However, to end mistrust amongst different communities and militant activities of BNLF, Government of Mizoram initiated Peace Talk with leaders of BNLF w.e.f. 7.9.2001 and after 12 rounds of talks, Memorandum of Understanding was signed on 26.4.2005. The BNLF surrendered 9 different types of arms and 661 nos. of ammunitions.

_Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM)_ :

The BLFM was formed in December 2001 due to differences in ideology amongst BNLF members under the auspices of NLFT (BM) while negotiation was going on between Government of Mizoram and BNLF. The main objective was repatriation of Bru refugees staying at various Refugee Camps in Tripura. In the middle part of 2002, another outfit called Bru National Front (Independence Movement) was formed by dissidents of BNLF/BLFM. After functioning for over a year, the BNLF merged with BLFM in October, 2003. The first crime committed by the BLFM was kidnapping of a Mizo youth F. Lalfamkima, Sumo driver, near West Phaileng, Mamit District. However, after committing several subversive activities, the BLFM numbering 804 members surrendered to the Government of Mizoram on 26.10.2006 with 66 arms of different types of and 45 rounds of ammunitions

_Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM)/_ _BNDLFM_

 Though exact time of its formation is not known, BDFM are the remnants of the then BLFM who refused to surrender at the time of the latter's mass surrender on 26.10.2006. They formerly call themselves as Bru Revolutionary Army(BRA), Bru Liberation Army(BLA) etc. They seem to have no concrete aims and objectives and are more likely to be an armed gang rather than a well organised militant group. Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM) was formed under the patronage of Tripura based insurgent group i.e National Liberation Front of Tripura(NLFT)
