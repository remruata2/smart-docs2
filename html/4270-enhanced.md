****Emerging Security Challenges and Counter Measures along International Borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar****

**Introduction:**

Mizoram shares a 510 kilometers long unfenced international border with Myanmar which runs along six districts of the state and another 318 kilometers land border with Bangladesh along the three south-western districts. The Assam Rifles are responsible for guarding the Indo-Myanmar Border (IMB) while the Border Security Guard (BSF) is tasked with guarding of the Indo-Bangladesh Border (IBB). The people of Mizoram haveclose cultural and ethnic ties with the people ofthe neighboring countries, particularly the inhabitants of Chin State in Myanmar and Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. The porous nature of the two international borders coupled with the close ties between the people of Mizoram and the ethnic groups residing along the borders pose significant challenges in guarding the international borders.

1. **Emerging Security Challenges along Indo-Myanmar Border:**

**A1. Insurgencies:**

Myanmar has been struggling with civil wars and insurgencies since its independence in 1948. The conflicts have been largely between the military force and ethnic armed groups who are fighting for self determination. Mizoram share the Indo-Myanmar border with two states namely -Chin State and Rakhine State.The latest Myanmar’s military coup in February 2021 and the subsequent formation of resistance forces across the country led to the revival of these major armed groups as well as a number of new ethnic armed groups like Chinland Defence Force (CDF). In the month of September, 2023, a three days workshop on Future Chinland Constitution Planning was held Aizawl which was attended by members of CNF and CDF. Later, an Interim Chinland Council was established in February, 2024 with Camp Victoria, as its Headquarters. Chinland Council, however is not accepted by some of the ethnic groups of Chin State leading to formation of Chin Brotherhood. The ongoing tension between these two conglomerations of major armed groups in the neighboring Chin State could not be taken lightly in view of the part played by some of the NGOs in Mizoram as a mediator of peace between the two groups. Further, the alliance between Chin Brotherhood and Arakan Army could further escalate the situation in Chin State as well as Rakhine State. An armed clash had earlier occurred between Chinland Council and Arakan Army at Matupi Township, Myanmar in June, 2024 and if such armed confrontation is repeated with increase intensity, a spillover effect into Mizoram, India could not be ruled out. Further, the internal feud of these armed groups if mishandled could adversely affect the ongoing projects of India’s Act East Policy like the Kaladan Multi Modal Transport Transit Project (KMMTTP) and the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway.

The increase military operation conducted by the armed ethnic groups in different parts of Chin State and Rakhine State of Myanmar led to surrendering of Myanmar Army to Mizoram Police as well as Assam Rifles since the last part of 2023. As many as 635 Myanmar Army personnel had since surrendered inside Mizoram, India with the last batch consisting of 92 personnel airlifted from Lengpui Airport on January, 2024 by Myanmar Airforce Special Flight. With the capturing of most of the Myanmar Army camps in Chin and Rakhine State, the dominance and free movements of these armed groups in neighboring states of Myanmar could also pose a threat to the security of the state of Mizoram.

During the military operation conducted since 15.05.2024 by Chin National Army (CNA) led ethnic armed groups under Chinland Council against the State Administrative Council’s Myanmar Army and the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) Eastern Command camps inside Tonzang Township, the CNA led armed groups reportedly captured most of the camps allegedly occupied by Myanmar Army and ZRA Eastern Command including Dampui Camp (ZRA), Nakzaang Camp (Myanmar Army), Chikha Camp (Myanmar Army), Eliza Camp, Suansang (ZRA) and Tonzang Town Camp (Myanmar Army) on 19.05.2024. Till December 2024, the Chin Brotherhood Alliance had futher captured the Myanmar Army camps at Mindat, matupi, Kanpelet, Hakha and Thantlang town. During these clashes, the Myanmar Army retaliated by conducting airstrikes over Tonzang town, Nakzaang and Lungtak villages which led to desertion of these villages by the civilians.

**A2. Illegal Immigration and Refugee Issue:**

As mentioned, the close ties between the people along the border and the unregulated Free Movement Regime (FMR) which allows people across the border to enter the country without VISA could easily be gateway for illegal immigration.To tackle this issue,the Indian government has implemented new measures to regulate movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following a directive from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).On 24thDecember 2024, the MHA announced a new protocol that reduced the free movement regime (FMR) range from 16 km to 10 km, only residents living within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border are now required to obtain a Border Pass for travel.The border pass, which allows a stay of up to seven days, is being issued to both Indian and Myanmar citizens who can provide documentation verifying their residence within the 10-km zone.

The Myanmar military coup staged in February, 2021 and the consequent armed conflict between the Army and the armed ethnic groups resulted in huge influxes of refugees into Mizoram from Myanmar. The lack of prescribed regulation regarding the movement of refugees and possible empathizers of ethnic armed groups within the state as well as across the border is an eminent security threat.The issue of overstaying refugee in the state could be a potential security threat in the near future if not handled right. Procurement of commercial vehicles and setting up of small business by refugees in the name of sustaining livelihood pose a risk to the economic security of the state.Further, the procurement of Indian Documents like Aadhaar Card, PAN Card, Bank Pass Book, Driving Licence, Birth Certificateetc through illegal meansby the refugees indicated their intension to overstay.Also, the number of arrested Myanmar Nationals involving in smuggling of Narcotics Drugs has increase in the last few years.

**A3. Narcotics Drugs Smuggling:**

Due to the peaceful nature and the geographical proximity of the state to the Death Triangle, Mizoram has been exploited as a safe route for smuggling of narcotics drugs. After the military coup in Myanmar on February, 2021, there has been an increase in the number of seizures of narcotics drugs in Mizoram possible either due to the funding of some ethnic armed groups by narcotic smugglers or the direct involvement of these armed groups in the smuggling activities to fund their operations.The ethnic conflict in the state of Manipur which started in the month of May, 2023 disallowed movement of goods including smuggled narcotics drugs across the state which further increases smuggling of narcotics through the state of Mizoram.

The modus operandi and ways of concealment of smuggled narcotics used by smugglers is constantly evolving. The past seizures of narcotics in the state revealed that these drugs are often concealed in sealed food packages, vegetables, electrical goods and more commonly inside a car door panel or costumed concealed compartment inside a vehicle.

Further, the emerging trend of using end to end encrypted messaging applications and compartmentalizing activities like logistics, finances or intelligence gathering by different groups or units complicated the interception of modern narcotics syndicates.

**A4. Arms and Explosives:**

Smuggling of explosives in the state is witnessed mainly after the military coup in Myanmar which could be attributed to the reported use of such explosives by ethnic armed groups to fight against the military junta. These smuggled explosives mainly consist of gelatin sticks and its detonators are illegally procured locally from some explosive licence holders who often gave out the explosives for mining purposes. The number of arms and ammunition seized in the state even though decreases in the last few months, the possibility of arms and ammunition smuggled across the state by some ethnic armed groups of Myanmar could not be ruled out due to the recent capturing of most of Myanmar Army camps in Chin and Rakhine state.

| Cordex wire | - | 2000 mtrs | 28 bundles | 5250mtrs |


**A5. Arecanut Smuggling:**

Smuggling of illegal arecanut through Mizoram took place since the year 2016 mainly to evade the high tax imposed on the import of arecanut by Government of India to check import of arecanut from Indonesia through Myanmar. The Aizawl Bench of Hon’ble Gauhati High Court in its order dated 16th July 2024 has directed the CBI to probe the smuggling of arecanuts in Mizoram following a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by social activist Pi Vanramchhuangi on 29th April 2024. The issue of seizure of smuggled arecanut lies in the difficulty in proofing the origin of the seized arecanut and the shortage of infrastructure as well as manpower of the Custom Department, the concern enforcement agency empowered by the Custom Act.

As in the case of narcotics, smugglers of arecanut continue to use the state a route to illegally transport arecanut of foreign origin from Myanmar to Mainland India.As on 31st December 2024, Mizoram Police had seized 47,667 bags (3,367,830 kgs. approx) worth a total of Rs. 53,91,91,750/-which were further handed over to Custom Department and concerned District Magistrates for appropriate legal action or disposal.

1. **Emerging Security Challenges along Indo Bangladesh Border:**

**B1. Insurgencies:**

Once a tribal-dominant region, theChittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh has become a breeding ground of ethnic violence and tribal insurgency supposedly due to the influx of Bengali settlers in the hill tracts and deployment of military to control the area which was opposed by these tribal groups. A peace deal between the government and Parbatya Chattogram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) (Shanti Bahini) in 1997 did not seems to end the activities of the some of the splinter group which carries arms against the government since 2008 till date. The emergence of Kuki Chin National Front (KNF) and its armed wing Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) in 2021intensifies the violence in the area. There has been unconfirmed allegations from the Border GuardBangladesh (BGB) that miscreants of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) particularly ParbatyaChattagram Jana SamhatiShamiti (PCJSS), United Peoples Democratic Front (UPDF), Kuki Chin National Front (KNF) are either staying inside India or establishing their camps inside India which was last highlighted in the Veracity Report of BGB Booklet during the DG, BSF and DG, BGB Level Border Conference held at Dakha, Bangladesh between 5th to 9th March 2024. The report that cadres of KNF/KNA or PCJSS (Shanti Bahini) are staying inside Mizoram, India could not be corroborated or confirmed. However, during an inquiry and spot verification conducted by Mizoram Police in the early part of this year revealed that makeshift camps for families of PCJSS cadre and for procurement of essentials from Mizoram are set up at the vicinity of Salmore (Salmur)Tipperaghat, and Malchari/Malsurivillages of Lunglei District, Mizoram.

A peace negotiation with the KNF/KNA was initiated by the Bangladesh Government on 29th May, 2023 through Peace Establishment Committee and two rounds of direct talks held on 5th November, 2023 and 5th March, 2024 during which the KNF/KNA demanded a separate administrative entity, a Kuki-Chin Territorial Council (KTC) comprising 7 (seven) sub districts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. However, the looting of Banks and arms by KNF/KNA on 2nd and 3rd April 2024 resulted in intensified combing operations against the KNF/KNA leading another rounds of influxes of Bawm refugees into Mizoram and possible entry of cadres of KNF/KNA.

**B2. Illegal Immigration and Refugee Issue:**

In the past, the western part of the state had witnessed illegal immigrants from the Bangladeshi Chakma community due to the construction of Kaptai Dam in Bangladesh which displaced the Chakma People from their habitats and also due to the armed conflict between the Bangladesh Army and Santi Bahini.

Smt. Sheikh Hasina resigned as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh on 5th August, 2024 due to the intensified protest against the reservation of 30% of government job for descendants of freedom fighters and an interim government under Mohammad Yunus was formed in the violence torn Bangladesh to bring back normalcy. However, on 18.09.2024, a Bengali man named Mohamed Mamun, who was suspected of theft was lynched to death in Khagrachhari District of Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh by a mob consisting of Chakma and Marma communities. The situation escalated leading to violent clashes between the Bengali settlers and the minority community in the CHT which reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least three people and destruction of numerous homes of the Chakma community. Acknowledging the reported atrocities of the indigenous Chakmas in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the Chakma community of Mizoram under the aegis of Central Young Chakma Association along with all the civil society organizations of the Chakma community organized a protest rally at Kamalanagar, Mizoram on 22.09.2024 followed by a candle lighting rally on the same night. The protest rally was participated by almost 2500 protesters who demanded the intervention of the Indian Government in the reported atrocities against the indigenous Chakma community of Bangladesh. The border guarding forces as well as the state police were alert to check any possible influx of the Chakma community of Bangladesh who had fled their homes. However, till date, there is no report of illegal entry of the Chakma community from Bangladesh into Mizoram, India due to the incident.

A military operation against Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) by Bangladesh Army in the month of October, 2022 at Chhaihkhiang Village, Bangladesh resulted in the mass exodus of civilians, mainly the Bawm community during which 272 (two hundred seventy two) civilians including women and children fled their villages to take shelter inside Mizoram. Subsequent military operations led to 3 (three) major influxes of Bawm civiliansinto Lawngtlai District of Mizoram. The latest Bawm refugees numbering 93 (ninety three) persons who entered Damdep-II Village, Lawngtlai District, Mizoram on the night of 04.07.2024 and were later joined by another 33 (thirty three) Bawm refugees at Chhippui BSF BOP entered and took shelter at Chamdur Village on 08.07.2024.

Smuggling of Narcotic Drugs from Bangladesh side into Mizoram is not reported. However, smuggling of Narcotic drugs possibly Methamphetamine tablets (Yaba tablets) from Myanmar into Bangladesh through Mizoram cannot be ruled out.

Smuggling of arms from Myanmar to Bangladesh particularly after the capture of Myanmar Army Camps/base by the resistance forces is reported and confirmed with the recent interrogation of accused person arrested on 17.09.2024 in c/w BKN PS C/no. 302/24 Dt.17.09.2024 u/s 25(1A)/25(1AA) Arms Act r/w Sec.14 Foreigner Act in a seizure of 1000 rounds of live 7.62 ammunitions at Zuangtui, Aizawl by Mizoram Police.

1. **Counter Measures along the International Borders:**

1. The State Police may be strengthen to accommodate creation of State Border Protection Force/Battalion to effectively check illegal entry of foreigners and smuggled goods into the country and to limit the issue of ethnic/foreigners identification faced by the central Border Guarding Forces.
2. Border trade especially along the international border may be legalized at the earliest to boost the economy and livelihood of the residents along the border and to curb smuggling of goods.
3. To check the possible issue of overstaying refugee, a new system of biometric enrolment of refugees which may allow the refugees to seek shelter in the state till normalcy returns to the neighbouring countries may be introduced. The biometric system may also be used to register people crossing the border for local trade or business.The State Government decided to proceed with the biometric data collection of Myanmar and Bangladesh refugees in Mizoram provided that these refugees are not deported until and unless peace prevails in their respective countries. The State’s Home department has written a letter to the Union Home Ministry to examine the Foreigner’s Identification Portal(FIP) which is meant for capturing the particulars of illegal immigrants and subsequent deportation requesting a change in the FIP to allow the refugees to remain in the State, and a reply on the matter is still awaited by the State. The Centre Government has extended the time of Biometric enrolment till December, 2024.
