 The Assistant Inspector General of Police (Hqrs)

 Mizoram, Aizawl

Subj. : Ruihhlo do chungchang-reg.

Sir

 Please refer to your letter no. VB/PHQ/Ruihhlo-DO-Commt/18/65 Dt.29.10.2024 regarding Ruihhlo do chungchang. In regard to Para 3, I am to state that this unit has a special team, ‘Narcotics Enforcement Team’ who monitors and tracked the narcotic crimes prevailing in Social Media platforms in Mizoram. As such, the team have been monitoring several Social Media platforms and recently, 75 kgs of Methamphetamine and 3.472 kgs of Heroin, total value of Rs.10,79,72,200/- were also seized by this Unit Joint Operation Team.

 However, due to shortage of staffs, all Districts could not be actively monitored and it is suggested that the District Anti Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) may monitor the Social Media platforms that are involved in selling of narcotics drugs within their respective Districts so that prompt action could be taken against those persons who are advertising narcotics drugs etc. on Social Media platforms.

 Yours faithfully

**(VANLALFAKA RALTE)**
