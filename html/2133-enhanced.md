****CHRONOLOGY OF EVENT/ISSUES RELATING TO MIZORAM (SELECTION OF CANDIDATES FOR HIGHER TECHNICAL COURSES) RULES****

******The State of Mizoram has no facilities for Higher Technical Studies within the State and the seats allotted to the State of Mizoram for Higher Technical Studies by the Central Government are insufficient to meet the requirement of technical manpower of the State.**

** ****The state Government had so far rendered its best to ensure free and fair selection of candidates for the allotment of Professional and Technical courses using the Central guidelines notified. Alleged discrepancies and illegitimate practices however do took place in the past selection processes. With the increasing consciousness and better awareness on rights and privileges besides developing the concept of nationalism among the Mizos, at times the State Government have had witnessed successive upheavals since 1981 with regard to the alleged discrepancies or illegitimate practises on the part of the State Government in selecting candidates for these courses. These upheavals involves demonstrations and strong protest mainly spearheaded by the Students Organisations. The timeline of events/issues since 1993 may be highlighted as under:**
