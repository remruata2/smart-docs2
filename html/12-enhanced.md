Sir,

Please refer to your letter No. cited above, in pursuance of the letter parawise comment on the above writ petition is submitted for further necessary action.

**1. PARAWISE COMMENT**:- On the Writ Petition (C) No.-5958/09 in c/w Misc Case No. 66/2010 submitted by Team Life Care Insurance (India) Pvt. Ltd., TLC Building, Sh. Ayyappe Arcade, 4-A, Pampa Enter, Hebbal, Kempapura, Bangalore-560024, Andhra Pradesh to the Guwahati High Court.

**2. SI No. 5 Para-I** – Manipur Police to comment

**3. PARA 5(II):** The Mizoram Police CID (SB) had not freeze any account of the petitioner nor had interfered with the conduct of seminar or promotional meetings held for the co-ordinators and prospective co-ordinators.

In addition to the above mentioned fact, the said para 5 (II) mentioned that local police interfered with seminar/promotional meeting conducted by the petitioner on 13.12.09 at “Conference Hall”, Babutlang, Aizawl-796001. Enquiry revealed that there is no building or hall designated as “Conference Hall” at the locality mentioned i.e. Babutlang. The following four centres are located at Babutlang which could possibly be used for such seminars, which are as follows:-

1. Archive Hall
2. Engineers Club
3. YMA Conference Hall
4. Co-operative Conference Hall

Contacting the authorities of the above said 4 halls revealed that none of them had been hired on the date cited in the Writ Petition i.e. 13.12.09 not to mention the alleged interference by the Police. Further mentioned be made that business seminar/promotional meeting are hardly conducted on Sundays if not at all, which was the day on which 13.12.09 falls, as Mizoram is a Christian State. Therefore, the question arising is whether the claimed seminar was in fact really conducted by the petitioner or not, rather than the allegation that Mizoram Police interfere with it.
