The students were intercepted by Assam Police before they reached the disputed site and they subsequently used force to disperse them. It has been reported that the Assam Police initially used Lathi but later on resorted to firing and around 8 (eight) shots were reportedly fired as a result of which one MZP member reportedly sustained gunshot injury on his right ankle and around 49 (forty nine) others sustained injuries on their persons.

(2) Taxi -1 no. (3) Car (Nano) - 1 no. (4) M/Cycles -3 nos.****

******The scuffle which arose between MZP and Assam Police due to border issue at Zophai resulted in the announcement of Non-Mizo curfew by the students’ organization under the aegis of Mizo Students’ Union (MSU) on 10.3.2018. The curfew was soon called off and there was no report of untoward incident.**

 Many non-Mizos left Mizoram out of fear for their own safety; there were rumours among themselves about possible consequences due to the border issue. However, at the moment, life is peaceful and normal again. Most of the Non-Mizos who had left Mizoram have also come back to Mizoram and resumed their normal routine life.

 The matter remains dormant and could erupt again any moment depending on the time when MZP resurface the issue.
