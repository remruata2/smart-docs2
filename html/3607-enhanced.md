****Former officials convicted in bribery case**: Pu Lalremthanga s/o K.Pahlira (L), Chanmari veng, Lunglei was convicted to five years imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 15 lakhs by Dr. HTC Lalrinchhana, Judge, Special Court (Prevention of Corruption Act ) yesterday under section 120B/420/468/471 IPC r/w section 13(2) &amp;13(1)(d) and the Court judgement was proclaimed yesterday itself. Pu Lalremthanga was accused of receiving Rs. 268 lakhs as a bribe for granting supply and contract works while he was serving as a Managing Director in Mizoram Agriculture Marketing Corporation (MAMCO). The Judge of the Special Court (Prevention of Corruption Act ), after hearing both the statements of defence and prosecution lawyers, convicted the accused based on previous judgements made by Supreme Court of India. Under section 420(r/w 120B/471), the accused is to be imprisoned for a period of 5 years with a fine of Rs. 5,00,000 and 5 years imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5,00,000 under section 468(r/w120B/471) IPC. The punishment under which he was also booked, section 13(2) (r/w 13(1)(d)) of PC Act, is 5 years imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 5,00,000. The Judge, however, considering the fact that it was the first criminal case of the accused, shows leniencies by clubbing together the imprisonment period to 5 years in all while the amount of fines reach Rs. 15,00,000 in total.**
