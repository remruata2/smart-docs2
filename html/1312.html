Interestingly, Mizoram lies at the periphery of the Golden Triangle historically known for its drug manufacturing and trade. Mizoram has also always been a socio-cultural corridor because, historically as well as recently, populations ethnically related to the residents of the state reside in the neighbouring regions of both foreign countries and within India. This creates favourable conditions for economic and financial interactions both legal and illicit making it both a destination as well as transit point for various goods. </span></span></span></span></p>

Besides these, there are various synthetic drugs that are being abused and are causing socio-cultural problems among the youth. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:7px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">In recent years there has been an alarming trend of smuggling of Pseudoephedrine from mainland India through Mizoram into Myanmar. The smuggled Pseudoephedrine is used for preparation of Methamphetamine in jungle labs in Myanmar. The finished products i.e. Methamhetamine tablets are then smuggled back into Mizoram from Myanmar for local consumption or further distribution in other states. Meanwhile, almost all Ganja seized by Drug law enforcement agencies in Mizoram have entered via Manipur.</span></span></span></span></p>

The pre-cursor drug is manufactured as Amphetamine-Type Stimulants that is, Meth Amphetamine in simple laboratories at Myanmar. The seizure of large quantity of Meth Amphetamine by Mizoram Police during 2015 &ndash; 2020 (till date) manifest the fact that pre-cursor drugs viz. Pseudo-Ephedrine smuggled to Myanmar through Mizoram is manufactured as Meth-Amphetamine (a dangerous banned substance) across the border and pushed back into Mizoram. The reverse trend needs serious attention by Drugs Law Enforcing agencies.</span></span></span></span></p>
