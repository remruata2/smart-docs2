1. **TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS/PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES**

****CHALLENGES AND COUNTER MEASURES****

INTRODUCTION :

Drug trafficking is an illicit trade involving the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale of substances which are subject todrug prohibitionlaws. Proximity of the Indo-Myanmar border to the ‘Golden Triangle’, growing demand for drugs among the local population in the North Eastern states, political instability and insecurity brought about by numerous insurgencies in the region as well as a porous and poorly guarded border provided a proliferating environment for traffickers to smuggle heroin and psychotropic substances into the country through the Indo-Myanmar border. Heroin and other illegal drugs are trafficked into India across the border into the states of Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram.Particularly for Mizoram, which shares a 496.531 kms long international border with Myanmar, drug trafficking across the border occurs with ease. Because of close cross-border cultural ties, both governments have agreed a 16-km free movement zone around the border for the tribal groups divided between the two countries. The border is virtually open, with just one operational checkpoint, and many tribal groups are divided between the two countries. Myanmar is the world’s second-largest producer of opium, and thus Mizoram is today the first stop on the flow of heroin out of the region. While drugs have seeped through the unfenced border for many years, trafficking of heroinand methamphetamine has seen a steep rise in recent years. Drug trafficking in Mizoram mainly features the following dimensions:

- Trafficking of heroin and methamphetamines from Myanmar into Mizoram for sale in Mizoram and onto other states.
- Trafficking ofpseudo-ephedrine precursors for the manufacturing of methamphetamines through Mizoram into Myanmar.
- Trafficking of heroin and other narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances from neighbouring states into Mizoram for sale in Mizoram.

Major drugs which are commonly trafficked in Mizoram are heroin, opium, ganja, methamphetamine, ephedrine, Nitrazepam, Diazepam, Alprazolam and various cough syrup. The state government is taking massive effort to curb the menace of drug trafficking and prosecute the drug traffickers. Mizoram Police and the state Excise and Narcotics Department have had tremendous success in tackling the drug problem.

CHALLENGES :

The major challenges faced by local law enforcement agencies, particularly the Mizoram Police in tackling trafficking of drugs/psychotropic substances are as follows :

- The border with Myanmar is very porous. Although checking of vehicles for drugs and other contraband items is done at Police Check Gate at Zokhawthar (main entry point from Myanmar into Mizoram, India), smugglers/traffickers find alternate routes into Mizoram, crossing the river Tiau at various points along the 496.531 kms long international border with Myanmar. Lack of sufficient manpower at Zokhawthar Police Station is preventing the Mizoram Police to dominate the border and successfully prevent cross border trafficking of drugs. The same may be said for Vairengte Police Check Gate where drugs are smuggled in from Assam, mostly in load carrying vehicles. Insufficient staff and heavy flow of traffic in and out of Mizoram through Vairengte have made it difficult to thoroughly check all vehicles coming into Mizoram from Assam for illegal drugs.

- The terrain of the Indo-Myanmar border also poses a major challenge. rugged mountains, deep river channels together with lush forest characterise the border. Construction of means of transportation and communication is difficult in such a terrain, and as a result, the border area remains sparsely populated with depressed economic development. Absence of roads, communication links and other border guarding infrastructure also adversely affect Policing as they hamper the easy and rapid movement of the border guarding forces along the border.

- The **Free Regime Movement** permits the tribals residing along the border to travel 16-km across the boundary without visa restrictions. While the FMR has helped the tribes continue maintain their age old ties, it has also become a cause of concern for the security as its provisions are exploited by drug smugglers and traffickers to cross over to India (Mizoram) unrestricted. Another provision in the FMR, which allows tribal people to carry head load has also been misused to smuggle in drugs, weapons and other contraband items. These head loads are seldom checked by the security forces.

- Lack of sufficient funds and other resources for engaging sources/informants have greatly hampered the ability of the Mizoram Police in gathering vital intelligence regarding the flow of drugs in and out of Mizoram, major trade routes used by smugglers/traffickers, identity and location of major players in the drug trade, etc.

- Procedural lapses on the part of Investigating Officers in cases under the ND&amp;PS Act have often resulted in the acquittal of major drug smugglers/traffickers in Mizoram and setting them scot free, thus enabling them to continue their business. Lack of practical training and experience of Investigating Officers in investigation of drug related cases under ND&amp;PS Act have resulted in acquittals merely on technical grounds.

COUNTER MEASURES:

- **Stepping up efforts to reduce demand :**

Drug trafficking is prevalent as long as the demand for drugs persist. Mizoram has registered a high percentage of drug abusers among its 10 lakhs or so population, and is one of the highest in the whole country. Civil societies, NGOs, various Churches and law enforcement agencies in Mizoram should put on a concerted effort to reduce drug addiction amongst the Mizo youths.

- **Aggressively expand collaborative efforts to counter money laundering :**

**Drug smuggling and trafficking is possible only by means of transaction of huge amounts of money. Such black money involved in the drug trade is being made clean or concealed through money laundering, which paves way for drug dealers, smugglers and traffickers alike to continue the illicit business. A collaborative effort between different law enforcement agencies and concerned financial institutions is necessary in taking legal action against known or even suspicious persons involved in the drug trade to incapacitate their business transactions.**

- **Strengthening the border :**

****The border with Myanmar, as well as other neighbouring states through which illegal drugs are smuggled in, should be strengthened in terms of manpower, means of communication and transportation and the latest hi-tech equipments to more effectively check people and vehicles coming into the state for detection of illegal drugs.****

- **Trainingof Investigating Officers on ND&PS Act****:**

**Police Officers empowered under the ND&PS Act should be well versed in the minute details and stringent procedures laid down under the said Act in order to avoid acquittals on account of procedural lapses which is a hindrance in the fight against drug trafficking. As many Police Officers as possible should undergo practical training on investigation of drug related cases under the ND&PS Act.**

- **Cooperation between different LEAs :**

****Collection of intelligence is crucial in combating drug trafficking and smuggling. All law enforcement agencies tasked with combating such menace should cooperate closely and share vital information regarding major drug trade routes, whereabouts of key players in the drug trade, any on-going trafficking operations in the state, etc in order to curb the menace of drug trafficking.****

- **Special drive with NGOs :**

The presence of a state-wide NGO such as the Young Mizo Association in Mizoram serves as an advantage in the fight against drug trafficking. The YMA is organised at the State level (Central YMA) as well as the local level (Branch) with different other layers of organisation in between. The various branches of the YMA organised at the local level are instrumental in the fight against drug trafficking as they can provide in-depth knowledge of the terrain of their respective areas, hence possible drug trade routes can be determined, sufficient manpower to augment the Police in checking of vehicles and people and are a reliable source of intelligence regarding any suspected drug traders or any active drug trade in their areas. Hence, special drive may be conducted regularly with the YMA or any other similar social organisation.

- **Strengthening the Mizoram Police :**

Mizoram Police has been at the forefront in the fight against illegal drugs. The Special Narcotics Police Station under CID (Crime), Mizoram has been established solely for the purpose of combating drug trafficking. The most effective means in combating drug trafficking is collection of intelligence by cultivating and engaging informants which often requires huge sums of money to earn their trust and loyalty and to carry out special operations. Also, effective means of transportation and communication as well as the latest hi-tech surveillance equipments and tactical gears are all necessary for the Police to conduct successful operations against drug traffickers. Hence, it is of paramount importance, more than anything, to strengthen the Mizoram Police with sufficient manpower, funds and resources.

- **Setting up of new zone NCB Office at Aizawl:**

The need for setting up of NCB Office at Aizawl is for seeking assistance purporting to Narcotics control scheme, and in order to effectively combat the rising threat of drugs trafficking in the state and also to assist the state police in investigation of drugs cases having inter-state and international ramifications.
