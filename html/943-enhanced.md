**2. Press Release by dissolved YMA leaders of Sakawrdai :**

 Leaders of the dissolved branch YMA of Sakawrdai had issued a press release yesterday, i.e.12.12.12 expressing their disappointment upon leaders of the CYMA stating that no CYMA leaders have visited them even after a lapse of 8(eight) months after they had reluctantly deposited their seal since 1st May, 2012 following the HPC(D)’s diktat dissolving the branch YMA. The so called ex-YMA leaders’ convention of Sakawrdai in their press release also criticized the CYMA leaders for allegedly neglecting them stating that their problems had not even been included in the agenda of the general conference.

 Further taking on the CYMA for their alleged neglect, the so called ex- YMA leaders convention also expressed fear that they would be compelled, out of necessity, to form an indigenous NGO other than YMA within the Tuisual group YMA area where the majority 80 percent are Hmars, and also accused the CYMA of being controlled by a political ideology which do not provide for the integrity of the various ethnic tribes of the Mizo.
