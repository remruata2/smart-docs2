****COMMENTS ON REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE CONSTITUTED TO STRENGTHEN BORDER PROTECTION ON INDO-BANGLADESH BORDER (IBB) PERTAINING TO THE STATE OF MIZORAM.****

****Brief overview of the Report:****

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has set up a Committee on 19.10.2016 under the Chairmanship of Shri.Madhukar Gupta, Retd. Home Secretary, to look into issues pertaining to strengthening of border protection and to address the issue of gaps and vulnerability in border fencing along the Indo-Bangladesh Border (IBB). Accordingly, the National Security Council Secretariat has brought out the Report of the Committee in June, 2017.

The Committee presented its Report in two volumes. Volume I is divided into 7 Chapters dealing with the major issues involved in impinging, directly or indirectly, upon, the arrangements for protection and management of the border, and Volume II is divided into 5 Chapters containing a detailed review of the situation in each of the border states, with State-wise Review of the state of Mizoram contained in Chapter 3.

The following Comments on recommendations of the Committee constituted to strengthen border protection along IBB, while highlighting the brief of each Chapters, will confine to points relating to the state of Mizoram only. Hence, it is considered not feasible or necessary to make para-wise comments on the entire report. Only relevant points will be pointed out and the two volumes will be separately looked into

****Volume-I****

A gist of each Chapter is made. Relevant paragraphs worth given attention are re-produced with necessary comments wherever considered necessary.

**Chapter-1 : Background**

This chapter deals with the General background as well as Historical background of Indo-Bangladesh relations by dividing the whole chapter into Pre-1947, 1947-1971, 1971-2009 and 2009 to present day eras. It looked into the internal politics of Bangladesh, the nature of the governments which have been in power there, etc.

**Chapter-2 : India-Bangladesh Relations**

This chapter described 2008 Election in Bangladesh as a watershed and repeated victory of the Awami League in 2014 created an opportunity to restore the friendly relations between the two countries. It highlighted various steps taken for strengthening of bilateral ties, such as, respective visits of both countries by leaders, bilateral dialogues and discussions, signing of bilateral agreements/documents, Land Boundary Agreement (LBA), etc.

**Para 2.5.1.3 :Areas under adverse possession –** there were several areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and West Bengal, where the land falling in the territory of India was under the adverse possession of Bangladesh and vice-versa.

**Para 2.5.2:Coordinated Border Management Plan (CBMP) –** the Directors General of the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) signed CBMP on 30.7.2011. This aims to synergise the efforts of both the border guarding forces for more effective control over cross border illegal activities and maintenance of peace and harmony in the border areas.

**Para 2.5.3 :** As per Indo-Bangladesh Guideline for Border Authorities, 1975, no permanent defence structures can be erected by either side within 150 yards of the border. This had, inter alia, resulted in bottleneck in fencing in several areas with habitation close to the Zero Line, and others with terrain related limitations.

**Para 2.5.5 :** The BGB has taken steps to strengthen its deployment and establishing BOPs in the Chittagong Hill Tracks, opposite Mizoram and Tripura, as a positive response to Indian security concerns regarding operations of Indian Insurgent Groups (IIGs) from Bangladesh soil. Correspondingly, use of roads on the Indian side for construction and maintenance of such BOPs by BGB has been agreed.

**Para 2.5.7:District Magistrate (DM) – Deputy Commissioner (DC) Level Meetings –** A unique mechanism was set up in 2014 to ensure coordination between the two countries in respect of border management related issues in the form of DM/DC level Conferences. There are 28 border districts on the Indian side and 31 on the Bangladesh side. These have been grouped into 10 Clusters for purpose of these Conferences.

 As per the report, two rounds of conferences have been held so far. As far as Mizoram Cluster is concerned, there are 3 districts of Mamit, Lunglei and Lawngtlai on the Indian side and 2 districts of Rangamati and Bandarban on the Bangladesh side. Two conferences were held on 22.1.2015 at Mamit and on 25.11.2015 at Chittagong.

 The report felt that it would be extremely useful if a mechanism could be developed enabling the DMs/DCs on both sides of the border to directly get in touch with their counterparts in matters requiring urgent attention.

 _The above recommendation is found highly welcome and the DM-DC Meetings being put in place should be given due importance and should be held regularly. The Minutes/decisions of the Meeting should be given due attention and necessary follow-up actions be taken._

**Para 2.5.8:** It was decided in 2011 that BSF would follow a non-lethal strategy on the border, with the objective of reducing killings.

**Para 2.13.4:** A MoU has been signed on the use of Chittagong and Mongla ports for movement of goods to and from India. The SOP to operationalize the MoU is under consideration. With the building of the link from Chittagong to Tripura through Sabroom and to Mizoram through Kawrpuichhuah, in both of which Land Customs Stations (LSCs) are proposed to be established and trade through this route will also be possible.
**Para 2.13.5:** A MoU for establishing Border Haats on the India-Bangladesh was signed in October, 2010, under which two Border Haats each, have been established in Tripura and Menghalaya and six more in these States have been approved, though they are yet to be operationalized. The above mentioned MoU expired in 2013, and a revised MoU has been signed, which will help to ease up the operating conditions and enable opening up or more Border Haats.

 As per Annexure 2.3 of Volume-II of the Report submitted by the committee which pertains to State-wise study on Meghalaya, two Border Haats are currently functional in Meghalaya and four more have been approved. Proposal for opening eighteen more Border Haats have already been submitted.

 _In this regard, it may be desirable to have an in-depth study on feasibility of opening of Border Haats in Mizoram as informal trade akin to formal Border Haats have been carried on in various points along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border for ages. The benefits that can be accrued from opening of designated Border Haats may be looked into._

**Chapter-3 : Illegal Immigration**

This Chapter deals with Indian experience on the issue of Illegal Immigration. It studies illegal immigration from East Bengal/East Pakistan/Bangladesh into India in its entirety of historical, political and economic context. It divided the whole issue of illegal immigration into-

Phase 1 : 1860 – 1905

Phase 2 : 1905 – 1931

Phase 3 : 1935 – 1946

Phase 4 : 1946 – 1960

Pahse 5 : Indo-Pak War for Liberation of Bangladesh – 1971

Phase 6 : Post 1971

It also contained tables showing data on Computed Estimate of Total illegal immigration, Actual Vrs Projected Population, Missing Population of Bangladesh. It also highlighted the impact of immigration which led to language agitation, change in religious demography, influence on politics, impact on security, causes of migration, issue of Climate refugees, trends and future prospects, etc.

****Para 3.16.3:** The Committee suggested that apart from the regular State Police, the special border policing arrangements made under the PIP (Prevention of Infiltration into India of Pakistani Nationals) and PIF (Prevention of Infiltration of Foreigners) Schemes needs to be strengthened and strengthened as a proper _‘second line of defence’,_ and in some cases, financial assistance will need to be provided to the State Governments for strengthening the local police with reference to border protection.**

It also suggested that, together with the Police, the Revenue administration will have to proactively step in, particularly in villages on, or close to the border, to identify illegal entrants on a continuous basis. Systems of maintaining suitable village records, etc. will also have to be established. Sustained action will be required to identify and bust the rackets of touts, agents and syndicates who are involved in facilitating illegal immigration.

_Records of the Revenue Department concerning border villages may be regularly updated and close coordination may be maintained between the State Police and Revenue Department. Strengthening of State Police with reference to border protection is found to be vital for effective border guarding. Establishment of ‘second line of defence’ in border protection is found much welcome._

****Para 3.18.2.1 :** As regards to Detection, Detention and Deportation of illegal migrants/foreigners, special arrangements for border policing were made in Assam, West Bengal and Tripura under the PIP/PIF Scheme. The Scheme was reviewed by Working Group on Border Management, constituted by MHA in 1992, and recommendations were made.**

_It may be beneficial if the above special arrangement made in these States is looked into for necessary implementation in Mizoram._

****Para 3.18.3 :** States (other than those mentioned above) are required to establish Special Task Force (STF) for detection of illegal immigrants, and to set up detention centres for housing suspected illegal migrants during inquiry. While states are expected to bear the expenditure on the STF and setting up detention centres, the Central Government has agreed to reimburse the operational expenses of the detention centres, viz., feeding and transportation for purposes of deportation.**

_STF may be immediately constituted (if not already constituted). Detention Centres may be set up along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border._

**Para 3.19.1 :** It highlighted the main features of guidelines/instructions issued by the MHA in respect of detection and deportation of Bangladeshi nationals residing illegally in various parts of the country :

1. Bangladeshi nationals intercepted at the border while crossing into India unauthorizedly shall be immediately sent back by the BSF there and then.
2. In case of inadvertent crossers, BSF should take them into custody and interrogate them. If found innocent, they should be handed over to the BGB after holding a flag meeting.
3. All State Governments may set up Special Task Force (STF) in each district of the State for detection of illegal immigrants.
4. On detection of Bangladeshi nationals staying illegally in any State/UT, a proper inquiry should be conducted by the State Government concerned. If the person claims Indian Citizenship and a place of residence in any other State, a report should be sought from the concerned State, which should be sent after proper inquiry within 30 days. If no report is received within this period, action may be taken to deport the suspected Bangladeshi national. Pending completion of inquiry, the suspected persons may be kept in detention centres, with permission of the Court wherever necessary.
5. After completion of the inquiry, orders would be issued by the competent authority of the concerned State Government, under Section 3(2) (c) of the Foreigners Act, 1946, for deportation of the persons found to be residing illegally within their jurisdiction. The competent authorities include the FRROs and the FROs.
6. In case of the Border States, the concerned authorities of the State Government will hand over the persons found, on inquiry, to be illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, directly to the designated BSF officer at the designated place on the border for deportation.
7. In cases of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh who are apprehended and action against them is taken under Section 14A (b) of the Foreigners Act, 1946, and whose cases are referred to the Bangladeshi High Commission for nationality verification, deportation/repatriation is to be done after the nationality is verifies, pending which they are to be kept in detention centres.

_The above guidelines/instructions of the MHA may be given due attention for necessary compliance. SOP may be prepared in consultation and coordination with all concern stake-holders, including the BSF._

**Chapter-4 : Cattle Smuggling across the Indo-Bangladesh Border**

This Chapter deals one of the major concerns on Indo-Bangladesh border, i.e., large-scale cattle smuggling. The Report stated that large scale and rampant smuggling of cattle from India across the border into Bangladesh has continued almost unabated, even though there has been an increase in the number of seizures by the BSF in the last couple of years.

It also contains a table containing figure on Details of Cattle seized by BSF on the Indo-Bangladesh border (2012-2016). The figure concerning Mizoram is Nil.

****

**Chapter – 5 : Threats from Indian Insurgents Groups (IIGs) and Radicalisation**

 This chapter deals basically deals with the use of the territory of Bangladesh by IIGs and the threats from radicalized Islamic extremist groups. It also contains list of major insurgents groups in the north eastern states.

 The Report stated that Mizoram remains, by and large, peaceful, except for the fact that, it is being used as a transit corridor by the IIGs for trans-shipment of arms and ammunitions from Myanmar, both into India and Bangladesh.

**Chapter-6 : Infrastructure, Border Development and Institutional Arrangements.**

**Para 6.1.1 :** Mizoram shares a 318 kms long border with Bangladesh.

****Para 6.1.4.1 :** It contains State-wise details of border fencing along the IBB. Under the whole fencing project, Mizoram has a sanctioned fencing length of 348.68 kms, out of which 159.50 kms has been completed.**

****Para 6.1.5.1 :** Table 6.3 contains State-wise detail of Roads along IBB. Under the whole road project, Mizoram has a sanctioned road length of 601.94 kms, out of which 324.86 kms has been completed.**

****Para 6.1.6.1 :** As regard to Border Flood Lighting, installation of 2617.6 kms long flood lighting with a project amount of Rs.1327.77 crores was approved. 333.55 kms was sanctioned for the state of Mizoram and out of which 91 kms have been completed, leaving a balance of 225.22 kms.**

****Para 6.1.7.1 :** 91 BSF Border Out Posts have been authorised for the state of Mizoram and out of which 61 have been sanctioned as Composite BOPs, and 5 have been completed.**

****Para 6.1.7.2** : The Report suggested for using of pre-fabricated technology for construction of BOPs in Mizoram and in the hilly areas of Tripura.**

****Para 6.4.7 :** The Report strongly suggested that there is no need for erecting a border fence in several stretches of Mizoram border as it have predominantly hilly terrain, and that only border roads should be constructed.**

_Step may be taken for involvement of the State Government in identification of stretches where fencing should be erected._

****Para 6.10 :** Creation of border guarding infrastructure and deployment of the BSF has led to feelings of suspicion and alienation among the local population vis-à-vis the border. This calls for special and focused attention at the level of the BSF, while devising their Civic Action Programme.**

****Para 6.11.5.1 :** Different elements of the State Police and other State departments will have to be closely involved and integrated into the border protection arrangements, as a ‘second line of defence’, in the form of Border Protection Grid (BPG).**

****Para 6.11.5.2 :** The Committee observed a very useful mechanism in Tripura in the form of State Level Operations Group (SLOG) chaired by the State DGP and the District Level Operations Groups (DLOGs) chaired by the district Superintendent of Police (SP). The committee strongly recommend that institutions on the lines of the SLOG and DLOGs in Tripura should be established in each State on the Indo-Bangladesh border to ensure close coordination between all concerned State agencies and the BSF, work out contours of the BPG suggested above, and continuously review the situation on the ground.**

_SLOG and DLOGs set up in the state of Tripura may be studied on a priority basis for necessary implementation in Mizoram. SLOG so established may work out modalities for setting up of BPG as ‘second line of defence’ in border protection._

****Chapter – 7 : Summary and Recommendations.****

 This Chapter summarises the various recommendations of the Committee as mentioned in the preceding chapters.

****Para 7.1.6 :** The Committee felt that we cannot, and should not, follow a uniform fence centric approach towards border protection. The Committee, in fact, recommended that, in some stretches in Mizoram, the proposals for fencing should be dropped. It suggested for completion of fencing wherever it is feasible but, both from the angle of the nature of the threats, and the physical limitations on the border, it will have to be supplemented by a well-defined border protection grid to be established with the fullest involvement and cooperation of the police and other concerned agencies of the State Government.**

_Step may be taken to ensure participation of the State Government in selection of areas where fencing should be constructed, keeping in view the present deployment of not only the BSF but also the State Police force along the border._

**Annexure 7.1 :** As per Annexure 7.1 (Page no. 215), the Committee made the following recommendations as regards to Border Infrastructure in Mizoram:

1. There is no need for fencing in the Dampa Tiger Reserve (DTR) area.

_This recommendation is found highly welcome as it can lead to deforestation of the reserve._

1. Out of the balance, the fencing work being executed by EPIL (11.16 kms) may be completed.
2. In the remaining 112.21 kms., allocated to NPCC, against which there is minimal progress (mainly in the form of earth cutting in 18 kms., grouting of angles in some stretches and only 2 kms. of fencing), fencing may not be done, at least for the present. Minor adjustments to maintain continuity, wherever necessary, could be done.
3. Border roads may be constructed along the entire length of the border. However, keeping in view the heavy rains and consequential damages to the roads, entailing heavy maintenance expenditure, there is need to review the design and specifications of the roads being constructed. Further, there is a need for close monitoring of the progress of the work, particularly in respect of the NPCC. In addition, in order to develop connectivity from the hinterland to BOPs, selected axial roads also need to be taken up keeping in view the proposals/projects being undertaken under PMGSY, for which detailed plans needs to be formulated.

_The recommendation is found practicable. Construction of border roads along the entire border is found desirable. Proposal may be prepared by State PWD Department regarding design and specifications of border roads and the same may be submitted to concern Central Ministry._

1. Installations of Border Flood Lighting (BFL) may be limited to areas where fencing is to be erected, and in even in stretches where the work has not commenced, the need for BFL may be reviewed in the light of its utility with reference to the terrain conditions and problems of electricity supply.

_Since power supply for electrification of BFL will have to be eventually provided by the State, the State Government should be incorporated in the entire project on BFL. Necessary proposal may be drawn up by the P & E Department for further submission to the concern Central Ministry._

1. Wherever new BOPs are to be constructed, the use of pre-fabricated technology should be considered.

**Intelligence Coordination:**

 Considering the concerns in Mizoram about possible cross-border activities of IIGs, and that the CHT area in Bangladesh also borders Tripura, it would be useful if ‘G’ Branch officers in the M&amp;C and Tripura Frontiers/Sectors alternatively participated in each other’s LIA meetings.

**Operational Coordination/Border Protection Grid:**

 The State Government has made a proposal for creating a V-Sat based network (instead of BSNL) under the CCTNS, and has requested for special funding and another proposal for raising a Border Home Guards to be funded under the head of Security Related Expenditure. The Committee feels that these should be considered positively by MHA.

_The above two proposals may be further pursued in the light of positive recommendation of the Committee._

**Border Development:**

 The areas bordering Bangladesh suffer from serious backwardness and deprivation in terms of socio-economic infrastructure, including roads/connectivity, electricity, medical facilities, drinking water, etc. and BADP is not being implemented as per guidelines. The Committee suggested that a detailed sector specific plans need to be formulated for the border blocks, to be implemented with funding through the BADP, Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC) and DONER.

_Concern departments of the State may formulate detailed sector specific plans for the border blocks and necessary source of funding may be explored._

****Volume –II****

Volume-II contains 5 Chapters dealing with State-wise Review of the states bordering Bangladesh, i.e., Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and West Bengladesh. State-wise Review of Mizoram is contained in Chapter-3 (page 73 – 95). Relevant paragraphs worth given attention are re-produced with necessary comments wherever considered applicable.

**Chapter-3**

**Para 3.1.1 :** Mizoram has borders with both Bangladesh and Myanmar. The border with Bangladesh stretches over 318 kms., lying between BPs No.2300 and 2364,M, which us co-located with BP No.1 on the Indo-Myanmar border (404 kms.)

****Para 3.1.2 :** The State of Mizoram is part of the Mizoram and Cachar (M&amp;C) Frontier of the BSF based at Silchar (Assam), and the border guarding responsibilities on the Indo-Bangladesh border in the State are distributed between 4 Battalions.**

**Para 3.4.4 :** The decadal growth rate of the Chakma is reflected in the following table:

**Decadal Growth Rate of Chakma Population in Mizoram**

| **Year** | **Population** | **Growth Rate (%)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1951 | 15297 |  |
| 1961 | 19337 | 26.41 |
| 1971 | 22393 | 15.8 |
| 1981 | 39505 | 78.2 |
| 1991 | 54194 | 35.8 |
| 2001 | 71283 | 31.53 |
| 2011 | 96972 | 36.03 |


**Para 3.4.5 :** Around 60 kms of Mizoram-Bangladesh border lies within the Dampa Tiger Reserve (DTR), which covers an area of around 500 sq.kms.

**Para 3.4.7 :** The Committee interacted with local villagers and their representatives, and also with district authorities , at a couple of locations. Some petitions were given to the Committee by the members of CADC and the Village Council Presidents at Parva. The main issues articulated in these are briefly indicated below:

1. There was a complaint that in a number of areas the alignment of the fence, including stretches where it is yet to be constructed, was considerably behind the border, due to which a large area of land will become a ‘no-man’s land’ and the people will not be able to cultivate it, and would thus be deprived of their livelihood.
2. Several villages are located on the river banks in narrow valleys, where the land is extremely fertile and wet rice cultivation is practised, with a majority of people depending on it for subsistence. The construction of border works are making many such areas unfit for cultivation.
3. In some areas, where the villages are located beyond the fence, the people will have to be shifted, for which no land is available, and they should be given compensation to be able to purchase private land for building their houses.
4. There were complaints that in a number of locations, where land had been acquired, compensation was yet to be paid.
5. When asked about the BADP, it was uniformly articulated that the funds are being utilized in the distant urban areas. There is need for very focussed attention to the above mentioned issues at the State government level and, within this, on the preparation and implementation of concrete plans under the above mentioned programmes/institutional mechanisms.

_Concern Departments of the State may be involved and proactive steps may be taken as regard to alignment of the fence, especially in stretches where fencing is yet to be constructed. Close coordination in this regard may be maintained with the BSF._

****Para 3.5.3 :** The aspect of road connectivity was the single most important area of concern articulated uniformly by the State Government, the local administration, the inhabitants of the border villages, and the BSF.**

**Para 3.5.4 :** As far as cross-border road connectivity with Bangladesh is concerned, there is an old Land Customs Stations (LCS)at Demagiri, which is presently non-functional. There is a proposal to develop an Integrated Check Post (ICP) at this point.

_Upgradation of LSC at Demagiri/Tlabung (presently non-functional) into ICP is an important step for development of trade between Mizoram and Bangladesh. State Government may continue to take necessary measures to expedite the project._

**Threat and Vulnerability Analysis:**

Para 3.6.3 : The State Government expressed concern over the influx of Chakmas from Bangladesh. The Committee gathered during an informal conversation that some time ago the YMA started a census of Chakmas in Lunglei district, which was stopped by the District administration. This aspect needs careful watch and consideration.

_All concern departments of the State should take full and continuous measures to prevent and detect any infiltration from Bangladesh. Inter-department coordination is vital to effectively counter illegal infiltration._

**Para 3.6.5 :** The main apprehensions on the border with Bangladesh pertains to the possible infiltration and criminal activities of IIGs and the use of camps/hideouts in the CHT area for this purpose. The cases of kidnapping, etc., in the northern part of Mamit can also be attributed to the activities of such groups, particularly, the NLFT (BM), in coordination with elements among the Brus. The other vulnerability appears to lie in the potential for influx of Chakmas, from Bangladesh, but this aspect requires deeper analysis (as mentioned in para 3.4.4), and, what may happen would also depend substantially on developments within Bangladesh.

_Movement and activities of IIGs based in adjoining areas of Bangladesh may be constantly watched and monitored._

**Border Guarding Infrastructure:**

**Para 3.7.1 :** The status of Border Guarding Infrastructure approved by the Department of Border Management, and its implementation, is indicated in the following Table:

****Status of Border Works in Mizoram****

| **Work** | **Sanctioned** | **Completed** | **Balance** | **In Progress** | **Yet to Start** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fence | 348.68 | 159.50 | 189.18 | 31.413 | 157.67 |
| Road | 601.94 | 324.86 | 277.08 | 86.714 | 180.36 |
| BFL | 335.00 | 91.00 | 244.00 | 85.00 | 159.00 |
| Composite BOPs | 85 | 05 | 80 | 48 | 32 |


**Para 3.7.1.1 :** The Committee did not see, to any significant extent, stretches where the border fence has been completed. It was observed that, in substantial stretches the fence has been constructed along the hill slopes and is not visible from the border road which goes around the slopes. In a number of areas, and also where the fence is along the border road, it gets completely covered with wild overgrowth. This has two implications: (i) There are serious questions about the usefulness of the fence in the former category, as also about the possibility of patrolling it effectively, which, in any case, would call for very intensive manpower deployment; and (ii) Considering the heavy rainfall and the flora in the terrain, maintenance of the fence, as well as keeping it free of overgrowth, is an extremely serious challenge, apart from requiring huge expenditure on a recurring basis.

_Though it mainly concerns the BSF/MHA, it would be desirable if the State PWD is made to get involve so that their expertise in construction of roads, especially at the stage of survey, can be utilized._

**Para 3.7.1.2 :** The main reasons for the slow progress of border fence work (over 50 % of the fence still remains to be constructed) are : problems of land acquisition, difficult terrain conditions, problems related to mobilisation of work force, extortion and incidents of abduction of workers, etc. Thus, it appears unlikely that the entire sanctioned fencing can be completed soon, which also have implications in terms of cost escalation.

**Para 3.7.1.3 :** There is no requirement or justification for fencing on around 60 kms stretch of border falling under Dampa Tiger Reserve (DTR).

_State Government may take step at the Centre in support of construction of border roads, instead of fencing, in the DTR area._

Para 3.7.1.4 : During the Committee’s discussion with the State Government, it was categorically stated by the Chief Secretary that the State Government has not been involved at the time when the decision to construct border fencing all along the border was taken, and they only became aware of it when difficulties and issues related to land acquisition starts coming up. The State Government opined that fencing all along the border was not necessary and, instead a proper border road should be constructed. A memorandum was also submitted by the Chairman of the Committee of the Legislative Assembly pertaining to the Home Department.

_Necessary follow-up action on the memorandum may be taken by the State Government at the Central Government level._

**Para 3.7.1.6 :** Fencing may not be taken up in the entire stretch of 112.21 kms. allotted to NPCC, barring minor adjustments for the sake of continuity on the ground wherever necessary.

**Para 3.7.1.8 :** There is no justification for border fencing on DTR, and instead only a border road should be constructed.

**Border Roads:**

**Para 3.7.2.2 :** Because of heavy rainfall for almost six months in a year, these border roads suffer heavy damage. Serious thought needs to be given to the possible upgradation of the border road specifications on a very urgent basis.

_Suggestions may be made by the State Government (PWD Department) on border road specifications suiting the climatic condition of the State and may be submitted to the concern Central Ministry._

****Para 3.7.2.3 :** The Committee is of the view that, in the context of border protection, the aspect of road connectivity with the border through axial roads is as important as the lateral (border) roads, in the case of Mizoram. This can be done by identifying selected links from among the existing roads and the proposals of the State Government under PMGSY, which can be taken up for being further developed as axial roads as part of border guarding infrastructure, as is being done in the Western Border.**

_The aspect of road connectivity with the border through axial roads may be given due attention. If not already done, surveys may be conducted and proposal may be formulated._

**Border Flood Lighting (BFL):**

****Para 3.7.3.2 :** A major problem on BFL in area where they are completed pertains to the availability of dedicated power line which has to be provided by the Power Department of the State Government. This is held up for want of MOU between the EPIL and the BSF and Tripartite Agreement between these organizations and the P &amp; E Department of the State Government.**

_Necessary plan may be made the P & E Department in due course._

**Para 3.7.3.3 :** (i) The installation of BFL should be limited to those stretches of the border where fencing has already been completed, or will be erected keeping in view the present status of the ongoing works.

 (ii) Considering the fact that there is no electrification in the border areas, there has to be integration between the general electrification plans of the State Government and the provisions of power supply for the BFL.

_General electrification plans of the State may incorporate provision of power supply for BFL._

****Para 3.7.3.4 :** In view of the above, the Committee felt that there is urgent need for review by the Department of Border Development with the State Government, BSF and EPIL to work out a well-considered plan of action.**

**Border Out Posts (BOPs):**

****Para : 3.7.4.4 :** The Committee felt that the entire rationale of establishing BOPs all along the border with an inter-BOP average distance of 3.5 kms., which underlies the sanction of 85 BOPs (initially 91 BOPs) for this border, needs to be immediately revisited. The Committee felt that establishing of 5 additional BOPs in the DTR appears to be completely unnecessary. The strategy for border protection in the DTR area needs to be worked out in consultation with the State Forest Department and State Police.**

_Establishment of 5 additional BOPs is considered undesirable in view ofpreservation of DTR. Construction of border roads may be advocated._

**Deployment and Border Dominion Strategy:**

**Para 3.8.1 :** The BSF, in its presentation before the Committee projected that, keeping in view of the very large AOR of each Battalion, one additional Sector and two additional Battalions should be provided to Mizoram.

****Para 3.8.3 :** The Committee is of the considered view that, given the terrain condition and the nature of threats and illegal cross border activity, and based on discussions with the BSF and the State Government, there is no justification at this stage for additional deployment as proposed by the BSF.**

****Para 3.8.5 :** Border domination strategy being followed on this border areas needs to be revisited, both in the light of terrain constraints related constraints and logistical factors, and the nature of the threats on the border, and should be develop around a better protection grid with fullest involvement and integration of local police and other agencies of the State Government.**

_More involvement of local police and other agencies of the State Government is found desirable as it concerns the security of the State._

****Para 3.10.2 :**A total of 29 Border Out Posts (BOPs) have been established under the MAP (4) and IRBs (25), along with 47 (MAP) and21 (IRB) Static Guards. The location of Police Stations, Police Out Posts and BOPs of the MAP/IRB should be plot on a map, along with the location of the existing and proposed BOPs of the BSF, with the aim of being able to see the disposition of the BSF and State Police BOPs in a composite manner, to see how the network of State BOPs, PSs and Ops, in conjunction with the BSF BOPs could be used as an effective second line of defence behind the border.**

_This may be prepared in liaise with the BSF._

****Para 3.10.3 :** With reference to the crime control functions of the local police, it was mentioned that the Central Scheme of CCTNS, which could also play an important role in tracking border crimes and criminals involved, had been substantially implemented in the State. However, there are serious limitations in respect of connectivity which is being provided, under the existing Scheme, through BSNL. The State Government has submitted a proposal to MHA for creating a V-Sat based network, along with a DPR, but they have been told by MHA to take up the matter under the Police Modernisation Scheme which the State Government does not find feasible; they want the proposal to be considered at the level of the Home Minister and be funded as a special project. In our view, the proposal should be looked at, and considered, in the context of the development of an effective border protection grid, which has been discussed in more detail later.**

_Proposal submitted for creating a V-Sat based network may be pursued with the MHA in the light of the above positive recommendation by the Committee._

****Para 3.10.4** : In addition to the State Police, there is also a Home Guard Organisation in Mizoram, as in all other states, with a sanctioned strength of 1260, including 154 regular posts. The Home Guards are presently being used mainly for guarding security and other important installations/establishments in various districts. Keeping in view the long international borders in Mizoram, and the difficulties in border protection, including surveillance and quick reaction, etc., on account of difficult terrain conditions, the State Government has proposed the raising of a separate Home Guards Battalion as a Border Wing of the organisation, comprising 75 full time and 714 part time functional posts (combatants), involving an annual expenditure of around Rs.9 crore. It has been suggested that, with the rising of such a Battalion, the strength of the BOPs of the Border Guarding Forces could be enhanced with added elements from the proposed Border Wing of the Home Guards, which could help in more effective patrolling and, most importantly, providing the vital element of local knowledge with reference to the terrain, possible infiltration route, identification of infiltrators/anti-national elements, etc. In addition, this will also provide an employment avenue for the youth in border areas. The possible deployment pattern, which includes deployment of one company in each of the border district, has also been indicated. We are of the considered opinion that this proposal merits serious consideration, and further details of deployment, use, etc., could be worked out jointly by the State Police, Home Guards Organisation and the BSF.**

_Proposal for raising of separate Home Guards as a Border Wing of the organisation may be taken up with the MHA in the light of the above positive recommendation by the Committee._

****Para 3.10.5 :** An important aspect in relation to the above proposal would pertain to funding. During discussions with the State Government it was mentioned that, due to the fact of the State being largely peaceful, the Central Government is not providing any funds under the head of Security Related Expenditure (SRE) any longer. It may be observed, in this context, that the proposal to raise a Border Home Guards Battalion could be seen as another form of employment/deployment of SPOs for purposes of border protection. Keeping this in view, as also the fact that the mandate of the High Level Empowered Committee (HLEC) of the State Police and other organisations, the issue of funding the proposal should not present any significant problems and difficulties.**

_The above recommendation of the Committee is highly welcome and may be pursued with concerned Ministry at the Central Government._

**Border Protection Grid:**

**Para 3.11 (ii) :** In addition to the lateral roads all along the border, an optimal network of carefully identified axial roads should also be constructed, to ensure both connectivity to the BOPs, and quick response in terms of QRT based approach.

****Para 3.11 (iv) :** If necessary, assistance could be provided to the State Government for minimum critically necessary infrastructure for their BOPs and enhancement of deployment at such locations.**

****Para 3.11 (v) :** Assistance should be provided to the State Government with reference to CCTNS, and linkages with BSF should be built into such a network, to facilitate inter-agency intelligence and operational coordination with reference to border protection.**

****Para 3.11 (vi) :** The proposal of the State Government for raising a Battalion of Border Home Guard should be urgently considered for approval, and this should be integrated into the proposed Border Protection Grid.**

_The above recommendations are highly welcome and may be pursued at the concern levels._

**Border Development:**

****Para 3.12.2** : Firstly, there are the aspects of connectivity and linkage with areas in the hinterland, and vital facilities related to a wider area level/religion infrastructure. These essentially include road connectivity with the main highways, which we have discussed earlier, and availability of electricity and telecom connectivity, which would be dependent upon a wider power/cable grid. The State Government needs to look at all these areas in a focused manner. Particular attention is required on connectivity, both terrestrial and mobile telephony. As far as roads are concerned, at one level, there is need to look at the arrangements for the maintenance of the National and State Highways – it is understood that the responsibility for the formal is also now with the State Government; and, at another, there is need focussed attention on developing connectivity with the border villages and habitations under the PMGSY within a time-bound action plan. As far as telecom links are connected, a special plan for establishing mobile towers in the presently unconnected areas should be considered.**

_Development of connectivity with the border villages and habitations under the PMGSY may be given due importance._

**Para 3.12.3 :** Secondly, there is need for development and provision of social infrastructure and facilities related to health, education, water supply, etc., at the local level in the border areas. We feel that there is need to conduct surveys and prepare sector specific plans with respect of the border Blocks. Funding for such plans could be provided through the BADP, the budget of the CADC and the Social Infrastructure Fund of the Ministry of DONER.

_Necessary surveys may be conducted and sector specific plans with respect to border Blocks may be prepared accordingly._
