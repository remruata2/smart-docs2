****CURRENT ISSUES IN MIZORAM****

****(08.07.2025)****

**Introduction****:**

 Mizoram faces unique security challenges due to its geographical location. It is sandwiched between two foreign countries, Myanmar and Bangladesh, and shares borders with neighbouring states like Manipur, Assam, and Tripura, which have experienced instances of militancy. Consequently, heightened vigilance is necessary in all border areas.

Mizoram has a 510 km-long international border with Myanmar and a 318 km-long border with Bangladesh. The international border, although somewhat porous, is occasionally exploited by various insurgent groups for arms smuggling and the transit of militants.

**A. INDO-MYANMAR**:

1. **Myanmar Refugee**:

1. _Brief history_ –

 The Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and armed ethnic groups in Chin State, Myanmar, have been actively resisting the military regime that seized power on February 1, 2021. This prolonged conflict has resulted in a significant displacement of civilians, particularly from the Chin community, with many seeking refuge in Mizoram, India. Since the military coup, there have been eight major waves of Myanmar nationals fleeing to Mizoram. In an effort to address the political crisis, leaders of various ethnic groups held a workshop in Aizawl on September 7-8, 2023, with the objective of establishing an interim government in Chinland.

 In addition to the Chin community, escalating clashes between the Myanmar Army, under the State Administration Council (SAC), and the Arakan Army in Rakhine State have further exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. Following the Arakan Army's capture of most major cities in Rakhine State, members of the Khumi tribe have fled to southern Mizoram, reportedly escaping atrocities committed by the Arakan Army.

 On May 15, 2024, the Chin National Army (CNA), supported by various ethnic armed groups under the Chinland Council, launched a military offensive against the Myanmar Army and the Eastern Command camps of the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) in Tonzang Township. By May 19, 2024, the CNA and its allies had successfully captured several key camps, including Dampui Camp (ZRA), Nakzaang Camp (Myanmar Army), Chikha Camp (Myanmar Army), Eliza Camp, Suansang (ZRA), and Tonzang Town Camp (Myanmar Army). By December 2024, the Chin National Army (CNA) led Chinland Council had further expanded its control by capturing Myanmar Army camps in Mindat, Matupi, Kanpetlet, Hakha, and Thantlang towns.

 As of 9th April, 2025, the Chinland Council has gained control over 80 % of the areas in Chin State while the Chin Brotherhood controls about 20 %. However, the SAC (State Administration Council) still maintains a military presence in Hakha, Tedim, and Thantlang towns, despite being surrounded by the Chin National Army (CNA).

 Meanwhile, the Arakan Army remains in control of Paletwa town and several areas within the district. The Mara District, Matupi and Mindat are under shared control between the Chin Brotherhood and the Chinland Council.

_Key Areas of Control:_

- Chinland Council  : 80 % of Chin State

- SAC : Hakha, Tedim, and Thantlang towns

- Arakan Army : Paletwa town and surrounding areas

- Shared Control : Mara District, Matupi District and Mindat (Chin Brotherhood and Chinland Council)

 It's worth noting that tensions persist between the CNA and the Chin Brotherhood Alliance (CBA), with civil society organizations in Mizoram working to facilitate peaceful dialogue between the two groups.

 During these clashes, the Myanmar Army retaliated with airstrikes on Tonzang Town, Nakzaang, and Lungtak villages, causing civilians to flee these areas. Fearing further airstrikes, many of these displaced individuals sought refuge and safety in neighboring villages within Mizoram.

****Report on Recent KNF/A Arms Deal, New Camp, and JAFHS Alliance -****

It has been learned that the KNF/A (also referred to as KCNA) recently completed an arms deal involving 18 Myanmar-made MA-3 rifles and an unspecified quantity of ammunition. The weapons were reportedly purchased from Myanmar-based insurgent groups, whose identities are yet to be confirmed. Out of the 18 rifles, five along with some ammunition have been shifted to the KNF/A headquarters at Rengtlang, while the remaining 13 rifles are currently hidden in an undisclosed location outside Hruitezawl village in Lawngtlai District.

Meanwhile, on 18 May, villagers of Chhippui discovered two abandoned bags near the international border (IB) and handed them over to the Border Security Force (BSF) at Chhippui Border Outpost (BOP). Upon inspection, BSF personnel recovered 100 rounds of 7.62mm and 150 rounds of 5.56mm ammunition from the bags.

Reports further indicate that KNF/A has declared Rengtlang (Botgach Mura) as its new headquarters and has re-established strong ties with the Islamist militant group, Jamatul Ansar Fil Hindal Sharqiya (JAFHS). Reliable sources reveal that several JAFHS cadres are currently stationed at Rengtlang alongside KNF/A members and are planning to undergo fresh training under the KNF/A.

The newly established KNF/A camp is situated atop the Rengtlang hill range in the Barthali Union under Bilaichari Upazila, near the international border adjacent to Chhippui, CADC. Presently, approximately 30 KNF/A cadres and 18 JAFHS cadres are stationed at the camp, equipped with around 5–7 assault rifles, including AK-47s and MA-3s.

It is also reported that KNF/A has received a sum of 1 crore Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) from JAFHS in support of mutual interests. In this context, KNF/A is actively seeking to procure additional arms and ammunition from rebel groups operating in Myanmar.

****Brief Report on the Rising Tension between CNDF (CNO) and HPO-****

Tensions escalated between the Chin National Defence Force (CNDF) under the Chin National Organisation (CNO) and the Hualngo People Organisation (HPO) after a failed attempt to hold a joint meeting on 18 May 2025. A team of 80 CNDF members led by Army Chief Pu Daniel Hrampi and CNO General Secretary Salai William Chin visited the HPO military camp at Kawt Sei, near Satawm in Falam District, to discuss education, taxation, and administrative authority.

However, 60 armed HPO members blocked their entry and declared rejection of talks, citing that HPO had already opposed armed delegation visits. During the standoff, CNO vehicles were damaged, and locals from both sides gathered in large numbers. HPO claims constitutional rights over local governance through the HPO/CDF Hualngo regional government, while CNO insists that all Falam District matters fall under CNO authority. On 19 May, both groups issued press statements asserting their territorial claims and warning of consequences for any encroachment.

As of 20 May, the conflict deepened, with both sides positioning troops around Tuibual and Satawm villages. Over 1,000 civilians, some armed, mobilized in support of their factions. On 7 June 2025, leaders from both groups declared that no negotiation will occur unless opposing forces vacate disputed areas such as Bualte, Hmawngkawn Khawhlui, Satawm, Khawthlir, and Lianhna near the Tiau River.

Without urgent dialogue, the situation risks erupting into full-scale ethnic conflict, bringing tragic consequences to Chin State.

****Report on HPO–CNDF Clashes in Chin State, Myanmar (July 2–7, 2025)****

****Executive Summary****

Between July 2 and July 5, 2025, intense armed clashes occurred in Falam District, Chin State, Myanmar, between the Chin National Defense Force (CNDF) and the Hualngoram People’s Organization (HPO). The conflict arose from unresolved disputes over administrative control, taxation, and education authority following a failed joint meeting on May 18, 2025. The violence led to significant territorial losses for HPO, mass civilian displacement, and one civilian fatality. By July 5, CNDF had captured all HPO-controlled areas, prompting over 2,500 residents to seek refuge in Zokhawthar, India. Peace negotiations initiated in Aizawl on July 5 show cautious progress but are complicated by the involvement of external armed groups, notably the Chin National Army (CNA). This report provides a detailed account of the events, humanitarian impacts, security responses, and ongoing peace efforts.

**Background**

The conflict stemmed from a dispute over administrative authority in Falam District, particularly in the Hualngoram area. On May 18, 2025, a joint meeting at Kawt Sei sought to address disagreements concerning education, taxation, and licensing authority, all administered by HPO. Citing the Chinland Constitution, HPO claimed the right to establish a regional government in Hualngoram with full administrative control. The Chin National Organization (CNO), aligned with CNDF, contested this, asserting that all administrative matters in Falam District fall under CNO jurisdiction. The failure of the May 18 meeting heightened tensions, leading to armed hostilities.

**Chronology of Events**

_July 2, 2025 :_ Outbreak of Hostilities.

_Time and Location :_ At approximately 11:00 AM, armed clashes erupted between CNDF and HPO forces in Phunte village and the Tuichirh area, 10–18 km from Zokhawthar on the India–Myanmar border. Fighting reportedly extended to Satawm and possibly Lianhna villages.

_Military Outcomes :_ CNDF captured Phunte and Satawm camps, detaining 10 HPO fighters and seizing 10 firearms (4 from Phunte, 6 from Lianhna).

_Civilian Impact :_ HPO imposed movement restrictions on villages suspected of supporting CNDF, particularly around Khawmawi. CNDF accused HPO of collaborating with rival Zo ethnic groups, escalating tensions. Civilians from Khawmawi began fleeing to Zokhawthar, India, fearing violence.

_July 3, 2025 :_ Expansion of Conflict.

_Military Developments :_ CNDF captured Kawtsei Camp, a key HPO stronghold, significantly weakening HPO’s position in Falam Township. HPO retained control over only two bases: Rihkhawdar and Khawmawi.

_Casualties :_ No fatalities or serious injuries were reported.

_Chinland Council Press Statement :_ The Chinland Council issued a press release expressing regret over the failed negotiations, urging dialogue, mutual recognition of territorial claims, and peaceful dispute resolution.

_Military Development :_ At approximately 3:00 PM, the Chin National Army (CNA) seized CNDF’s headquarters, Camp Rihli, in Leilet village on the border of Falam District and Thantlang, without reported casualties. Most CNDF personnel, deployed to Tio Khawmawi the previous day, left the camp undefended, and the remaining guards fled during the attack.

_Location Context :_ CNDF Camp Rihli is near CNA’s headquarters, Camp Victoria, in Hakha District which is around 5 kms North towards Saikhumphai village, Champhai, Mizoram.

_Refugee Update :_ A total of 625 refugees arrived in Vaphai and Saikhumphai, comprising 610 civilians, 8 CNO members, and 7 prisoners. Some settled with relatives in Saikhumphai, while 48 relocated to Vaphai. Three individuals attempting to cross into Mizoram from Myanmar were reported missing, presumed to have fallen into the Tiau River.

_July 7, 2025 :_ CNDF Attempt to Recapture Camp Rihli.

_Military Development :_ In the early morning, intense fighting resumed as CNDF forces, stationed in Khawmawi, attempted to recapture Camp Rihli from the CNA. CNDF deployed drones in the offensive, but CNA troops responded with sustained gunfire and retained control of the camp.

_Casualties :_ CNA casualty details remain unconfirmed. CNDF reported three personnel killed and two injured, with the injured evacuated to Vaphai, Mizoram, for medical treatment.

_Additional Incident :_ One CNDF member attempting to cross the Tiau River during the operation fell into the water and is presumed missing, increasing the total number of individuals missing in the river to four.

**Humanitarian Response**

_Refugee Distribution :_ Due to overcrowding at the YMA Hall in Zokhawthar, many displaced persons were accommodated with relatives. Over 130 individuals without relatives received shelter, food, and essentials from the local community. The Deputy Commissioner of Champhai provided 60 blankets and approximately 50 tarpaulins to assist displaced families.

_Refugee Statistics :_ As of July 6, 2025, 2,950 adult refugees were registered in Zokhawthar, with minors under 18 excluded from registration. An additional 625 refugees arrived in Vaphai and Saikhumphai.

**Security Measures**

_Border Control :_ Assam Rifles established roadblocks along the Indo-Myanmar border to regulate cross-border movements and prevent conflict spillover into India.

_Border Closure :_ The Zokhawthar border gate was temporarily closed on July 5 for security reasons but accessible for refugees from Chin State, Myanmar.

_Reinforcements :_ One section of Assam Rifles, supported by a platoon from the 2nd India Reserve Battalion reinforced security at Zokhawthar.

**Peace Initiatives**

  A peace meeting was held on dated 05.07.2025 at 3:30 PM at Aizawl, organized by Advocacy for Mizoram.

Participants –

HPO: Four representatives, led by former president Lalthanzauva.

CNDF: Two delegates, led by President Ngunthawna.

The meeting addressed territorial disputes in Hualngoram, located within CNDF’s Falam District but under HPO influence. CNDF emphasized its jurisdictional claim, while HPO highlighted the complicating presence of CNA forces in Hualngoram. CNDF raised concerns about CNA activities undermining their authority. HPO clarified that CNA forces, supporting operations against Myanmar’s junta, were beyond their control. CNDF proposed that CNA withdrawal from Hualngoram would allow HPO to maintain administrative structures without CNDF interference.

_Outcomes :_ Both parties agreed to continue dialogue to prevent further displacement and bloodshed. A follow-up meeting at 7:30 PM at the CYMA office in Aizawl discussed de-escalation measures, resulting in an agreement to reduce hostilities.

**Official Visits and Developments**

 On July 6, 2025, the Deputy Inspector General of the Assam Rifles visited Zokhawthar. Pu Lalmuanpuia Punte, MLA and Adviser to the Chief Minister, accompanied by three advocacy members, visited Zokhawthar and proceeded to Khawmawi, spending approximately 30 minutes before returning to Champhai.

**Conclusion**

The HPO–CNDF clashes in Falam District from July 2 to July 5, 2025, resulted in significant territorial shifts, mass displacement, and one civilian fatality. The CNA’s capture of CNDF’s headquarter camp Rihli on July 6 and the subsequent CNDF counter offensive on July 7 further complicated the conflict dynamics. Humanitarian efforts in Zokhawthar, Vaphai, and Saikhumphai have provided critical support to displaced populations, while security measures have aimed to prevent spillover into India. Peace talks in Aizawl show potential for resolution, but the presence of external armed groups like the CNA continues to pose challenges. Sustained dialogue and de-escalation efforts are critical to stabilizing the region and addressing the humanitarian crisis.

**SAC Military Movements and Resistance:**

As of June 2025, intense fighting continues in Chin State, Myanmar, between the State Administration Council (SAC) military forces and a coalition of resistance groups known as the Chin Brotherhood Alliance. This alliance includes the Chinland Defense Force (CDF), Chin National Defence Force (CNDF), and various local People's Defence Forces (PDFs) where Sizang PDF are participated as Majority.

The SAC deployed approximately 600 troops aiming to advance into Chin State. However, their progress was halted near Mualpi, close to a coffee plantation, due to strong resistance from the Chin Brotherhood and allied forces. In retaliation, SAC forces reportedly burned down Mualpi Village in Tedim Township, leading to significant civilian displacement.

_Resistance Gains :_

The Chin Brotherhood Alliance has achieved notable victories, including the capture of the Myanmar army's Light Infantry Battalion 304 base in Matupi Township. They also took control of Falam after a prolonged siege, overcoming the last junta stronghold, Infantry Battalion 268, on April 8, 2025.

_Current Situation:_

The resistance now controls a significant portion of Chin State, with the SAC's presence largely confined to isolated areas. Despite this, the SAC continues to conduct airstrikes in an attempt to regain lost territory. The situation remains fluid, with both sides preparing for potential escalations. The Chin Brotherhood Alliance continues to fortify its positions, while the SAC seeks to reclaim control through military offensives.

1. **KMMTTP and ARAKAN ARMY:**

 The Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) is a strategic infrastructure initiative by the Government of India. It involves a multimodal transport route that combines land, river, and sea segments to connect Northeast India with Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal. The route covers a distance of 882.21 kilometers and includes multiple modes of transportation.

**Lawngtlai to Zorinpui (Mizoram)**: land route 87.51 kms.

**Zorinpui Border to Kaletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 45 kms.

**Kaletwa to Paletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 60.70 kms.

**Paletwa to Sittwe (Myanmar)**: 150 km river route.

**Sittwe to Kolkata Port (Bay of Bengal)**: 539 km sea route.

 As of June 2024, construction of the KMMTTP land route within Mizoram is complete, although it is occasionally disrupted by landslides due to heavy rainfall. Meanwhile, owing to ongoing conflicts in Myanmar, only about 10 kilometers of earthwork has been completed on the land route between Zorinpui and Paletwa by the Myanmar New Power Construction Company, the firm assigned to the project.

 Since February 2024, the Arakan Army, which primarily consists of ethnic Arakanese from Myanmar's Rakhine State, has reportedly taken control of 14 out of 17 Townships of Rakhine State, including some parts of Chin State i.e. Paletwa. This control extends over the proposed route of the KMMTTP within Myanmar, with the exception of Sittwe. However, due to ongoing clashes between the Myanmar Army and resistance forces elsewhere in Myanmar, the Arakan Army and the civilians in Rakhine State have become heavily reliant on goods and petroleum products transported largely through Mizoram, notably Lawngtlai and Siaha Districts.

1. **The Free Movement Regime along the Indo-Myanmar Border :**

 Mizoram shares a 510-kilometer-long border with Myanmar, which remains unfenced and porous. Six districts in the state adjoin the international border, with Champhai district sharing the longest border with Myanmar.

1. _Brief history :_

 The Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that enables citizens of both countries to travel freely within a 16-kilometer radius of the border for up to 72 hours without the need for a visa. This initiative aims to preserve traditional ties and alleviate insecurity for tribal communities residing along the border.

 The FMR spans 1,629.5 kilometers of unfenced border shared between four Indian states - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram - and Myanmar. In January 2018, the Union Cabinet approved a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance economic interactions through this regime.

 However, concerns have been raised regarding the regime's misuse. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, militants and criminals are exploiting the FMR to smuggle weapons, narcotics, and counterfeit currency, taking advantage of the regime's leniencies to cross borders and evade capture.

1. _Border Fencing and Free Movement Regime Abolition :_

 On February 28, 2024, the Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Indian government’s proposal to build a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and to abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR). Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution expresses concerns that these measures would negatively impact the Zo ethnic communities, which have been historically divided by the border established during British colonial rule. The Assembly contends that strengthening this division with additional barriers would disturb the livelihoods and social connections of the border communities.

1. _FMR New Guidelines (Free Movement Limit On Indo-Myanmar Border Tightened to 10 Km, With Border Pass) :_

As per MHA Notification on dated December 24, 2024, the FMR range has been reduced from 16 kilometers to 10 kilometers on either side of the international border. The revised regulations, which came into effect on December 30, 2024, mandate the issuance of a Border Pass for residents within the 10-kilometer zone, permitting a stay of up to seven days.

1. Exemption under G.S.R. No. 1265:

  The Central Government, vide G.S.R. No. 1265, has exempted members of hill tribes, whether citizens of India or Myanmar, residing in the border areas under the Free Movement Regime, from the requirement of Rule 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950, subject to specified conditions.

2. Meeting chaired by Secretary (BM), MHA:

  On December 16, 2024, a meeting was convened under the chairmanship of the Secretary (Border Management), MHA, wherein State Governments were informed of the Government of India’s decision to regulate the FMR through the issuance of Border Passes. The Border Pass will be issued by the Assam Rifles based on the following criteria:

 -Proof of Identity (POI): A certificate issued by OC/SHO of Local Police Station (PS) or the local village chief/authority, confirming that the individual belongs to a village within 10 kilometers on either side of the international border.

 -Passport: The passport of the individual must indicate the address and name of the village falling within the 10-kilometer zone on either side of the international border.

1. **Surrendering of Myanmar Army**:

******Intensified military operations by armed ethnic groups in Myanmar's Chin State and Rakhine State have led to a significant number of Myanmar Army personnel surrendering to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles since late 2023.**

In November and December 2023, a total of 255 Myanmar Army personnel surrendered in the Champhai, Siaha, and Lawngtlai districts of Mizoram. This was followed by another 380 personnel surrendering in January 2024 within the Lawngtlai and Siaha districts. Initially, the Assam Rifles airlifted the surrendered personnel back to Myanmar using helicopters. Subsequently, they were evacuated by Myanmar military aircraft from Lengpui Airport. However, on January 23, 2024, a Myanmar aircraft scheduled to evacuate the remaining 92 personnel crash-landed at Lengpui Airport, resulting in injuries to six crew members on board.

Fortunately, there were no severe injuries or fatalities. The last group of surrendered personnel was eventually evacuated by two special Myanmar Air Force flights on January 24, 2024. As of February 11, 2025, a total of 635 Myanmar Army personnel had surrendered to the Mizoram Police and Indian security forces in Mizoram.

1. **Biometric enrolment of refugees:**

The Central Government mandated that all refugees must undergo biometric enrollment by the deadline of December 31, 2024. The Mizoram government agreed to collect biometric data from refugees from Myanmar and Bangladesh, with the assurance that they won't be deported until peace is restored in their home countries. The state's Home Department has reached out to the Union Ministry to modify the Foreigner's Identification Portal (FIP) to include these refugees, as the FIP is currently designed to track and deport illegal immigrants. The state is awaiting a response from the Central Government regarding this request. The Union Home Minister has also assured the Chief Minister that the refugees won't be deported until there is peace in their respective countries. It's noteworthy that the biometric data collection process has been delayed due to ongoing discussions with the Central Government.

**Myanmar Situation Update :**

**02.07.2025:** On 2 July 2025, intense clashes erupted between two ethnic groups in Myanmar, the Chin National Defence Force (CNDF) and the Hualngoram People’s Organisation (HPO)/Chin National Army (CNA), near Phunte and Tuichirh, approximately 10 km from Zokhawthar in Myanmar’s Falam District.

The HPO has imposed strict controls on the movement of people and market activities in villages aligned with the CNDF. The CNDF has accused the HPO of restricting the free movement of Zohnathlak residents in the Falam District.

The conflict began in Phunte and Satawm, with unconfirmed reports suggesting that fighting may have extended to Lianhna. The CNDF reportedly seized control of the Phunte and Satawm camps, capturing 10 HPO/CNA soldiers and confiscating firearms at the Phunte camp.

**3 July 2025 :**Clashes continued on the afternoon of 3 July 2025 between the CNDF and the HPO faction of the Chin Defence Force (CDF). The CNDF captured Kawtsei Camp, a significant HPO stronghold. Sources indicate that the CDF (HPO) now controls only two major bases, Rihkhawdar and Khawmawi, with no other significant outposts. No fatalities or serious injuries were reported during the day’s conflict.

Due to the ongoing violence, many residents of Khawmawi have fled to Zokhawthar, seeking refuge with relatives and at the YMA Hall. As of the evening of 3 July, 275 displaced individuals arrived in Zokhawthar. The Zokhawthar border gate was temporarily closed at 11:40 PM on 3 July. Displaced persons have been directed to register at the Registration Centre on 4 July 2025 under the Free Movement Regime (FMR).

**B. MANIPUR**:

1. _Brief history :_

The violent unrest that broke out on May 3, 2023, in Churachandpur District, Manipur, was sparked by the "Tribal Solidarity March" organized by the All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM). The march was a protest against the proposed reservation for the majority Meitei community. Unfortunately, the unrest escalated into a year-long ethnic conflict between the tribal communities and the Meitei community, marked by armed clashes, destruction of property, and loss of life.

The prolonged conflict resulted in a significant influx of displaced persons seeking refuge in Mizoram, fleeing the violence and instability in their home state.

**C. INDO-BANGLADESH :**

1. **Influx of Refugee :**

The Bangladesh Army launched a military operation against the Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) on November 15, 2022, in Chhaihkhiang Village, Bangladesh. This operation triggered a mass exodus of civilians, primarily from the Bawm community. During the initial wave, 272 civilians, including women and children, fled their villages and sought refuge in Mizoram, India.

Subsequent military operations led to three significant waves of Bawm civilians entering Mizoram's Lawngtlai District. However, the influx temporarily subsided during Bangladesh's election process in January 2024 and the peace talks between the KNA and the Bangladesh government.

The situation escalated again on April 2–3, 2024, when the KNA looted banks and seized arms, prompting intensified military operations. This resulted in further waves of Bawm refugees crossing into Mizoram.

On July 4, 2024, when 93 Bawm refugees entered Damdep-II Village in Lawngtlai District. Border Security Force (BSF) personnel attempted to deport them to Crocodile Camp, Kamtuli, but the Mizoram State Government intervened. On July 8, 2024, the 93 refugees, along with an additional 33 refugees, were safely transported to Chamdur Village.

1. **Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing**

The Indo-Bangladesh border, spanning approximately 4,096 kilometers, is one of the longest international boundaries globally. To enhance security and regulate migration, a comprehensive fencing project has been undertaken along this extensive border. Significant progress has been made, with over 90% of the fencing installation completed.

_Key Features of the Fencing Infrastructure :_

- _Primary Material :_ Barbed wire

- _Additional Features :_ Floodlights and advanced surveillance systems

- _Purpose :_ Effective border management and monitoring

High-priority areas prone to illegal crossings have been addressed, although some sections remain incomplete or require maintenance due to challenging terrain.

1. **Recent issues**

1. _Inter-Group Clash Between PCJSS and UPDF(P) in Rangamati: One Dead, Several Injured._

On the morning of 06 June at approximately 8:30 AM, a gunfire exchange occurred between the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) and the United People's Democratic Front (Progressive) [UPDF(P)] at Bangaltuli Union, Baghaichari Upazila, under Rangamati District.

During the incident, one UPDF(P) cadre was killed on the spot. Additionally, one AK-47 rifle was recovered by PCJSS personnel at the site. Two other members of the UPDF(P) sustained serious bullet injuries in the confrontation.

Tragically, a five-year-old child was also reported injured by gunfire allegedly fired by UPDF(P) during the exchange.

All PCJSS personnel involved in the operation withdrew safely following the incident. A contingent of the Bangladesh Army subsequently arrived at the location to verify and assess the situation.

Further investigation is ongoing.

- Increase BSF BOPs (currently 10 along Lawngtlai border).

- Consider relocating 92 BSF &amp; 163 BSF HQs to Lawngtlai for quicker response.

- Speed up fencing and construction of all-weather border roads and helipads.

2. _Deploy Police Stations in Hotspots:_

- Immediate establishment of police stations at Parva and Chamdur P, which are prone to illegal crossings and arms trafficking.

3._Enhance Surveillance:_

- Use night vision, drones, ground sensors for round-the-clock monitoring.

4. _Strengthen Intelligence Coordination:_

- Joint operations and intelligence sharing among BSF, SB, SIB, Assam Rifles.

_5. Community-Based Early Warning:_

- Involve Village Councils, YMA, Church networks to report suspicious movement.

**Conclusion:**

From April to June 2025, the Lawngtlai border region has seen growing militant buildup, military encroachment, and cross-border alliances involving radical Islamist groups. With the establishment of fortified army camps and militant training zones across the border, the threat to Mizoram’s internal security, communal harmony, and national sovereignty has intensified. A strong, multi-layered response—blending technology, border policing, community vigilance, and regional cooperation—is urgently required to safeguard the region.

**Bangladesh Operation Update**

**3 June 2025:** On 3 June 2025, at approximately 3:00 AM, the Bangladesh Army conducted an operation against a Kuki-Chin National Army (KCNA) hideout in Chalchara Khal, Paindu Union, Ruma Upazila, Bandarban District. During the operation, two KCNA members, Captain Sangmin Bawm (27), alias Putin, and Lalhimsang Bawm (25), alias Aahim, were killed. No casualties were reported among the Bangladesh Army personnel. The army recovered two MA-3 rifles, one AK-47 rifle, one Chinese SKS rifle, eight magazines, and a quantity of ammunition from the site.

A Bangladesh Army patrol team, accompanied by three guides (suspected to be KCNA or Bawm members wearing black masks), traveled to Prangsa Para in Ruma Upazila the previous night in eight military vehicles. The army subsequently located the KCNA hideout, consisting of three farming houses (Jum Ghar), and opened fire. Local Bawm community leaders and intellectuals reportedly cooperated with the army by providing precise intelligence and indirectly supporting the operation, as the KCNA has become increasingly isolated from its own community.

**G. MIZORAM-ASSAM BOUNDARY :**

The Mizoram-Assam border, spanning 164.6 kilometers, has been a point of contention between the two states for decades. The dispute stems from differing interpretations of the border's demarcation, with Mizoram advocating for the 1875 Inner Line Reserve Forest boundary and Assam upholding the 1933 Survey of India map.

**Core Issue and Consequences**

The fundamental disagreement over the border's demarcation has led to a series of confrontations and skirmishes, perpetuating tensions between the two states. Recent incidents have intensified the conflict:

1. _February 27, 2018 :_ Mizoram Zirlai Pawl (MZP) constructed a rest house at Bairabi Zophai, which was demolished by Assam Police and Forest Officials, claiming it was within Assam's territory.

2. _June 30, 2021 :_ Tensions escalated when approximately 60 youths from Vairengte attempted to set up a camp at Aitlang, Vairengte for the Mizoram Police. Assam Police stopped them, leading to a standoff.

3. _July 26, 2021 :_ The situation further escalated when around 200 Assam Police officers led by Anurag Agarwal, IGP attempted to forcibly remove Mizoram Police personnel from their camp at Vairengte Auto Stand, resulting in violence and injuries on both sides.

**High-Level Meetings and Negotiations**

Several high-level meetings have been conducted to resolve the dispute:

1. Chief Secretary Level Meeting (July 27, 2021): Held in New Delhi, chaired by the Union Home Secretary.

2. Ministerial Level Border Talks (August 5, 2021): Conducted at Aijal Club in Mizoram.

3. Ministerial Level Meeting (August 9, 2022): Held at Aijal Club.

4. Ministerial Level Discussions (November 17, 2022): Took place in Guwahati, Assam.

5. Latest Ministerial Level Talks (August 9, 2024): Conducted at Mizoram's State Guest House.

6. Secretary Level Official Talks (24.04.2025) : Held in Guwahati Rohika AAU- International Guest House.

The Mizoram-Assam boundary dispute remains a complex issue, marked by historical grievances and sporadic violence. Sustained dialogue and negotiation are crucial for achieving a lasting resolution.

**H. MIZORAM-TRIPURA :**

1. **Emergence of Tripura Ham Bagra TA Army (THBTA)**

A new Bru insurgent group, Tripura Ham Bagra TA Army (THBTA), has emerged in Tripura, comprising around 50 members, including 20 Bru refugees from Mizoram. The group is led by Phillip Ryoung, a former auto-rickshaw driver from Bandarima Village, North Tripura District, Tripura.

**Background of THBTA Formation**

The Bru issues in Mizoram are deeply rooted in the demand for autonomy in Mizoram, which led to violence in 1997. The Bru National Union (BNU) sought the creation of an Autonomous District Council for Brus in western Mizoram, but faced strong opposition from the Mizo community. This led to the formation of the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) in 1996, which engaged in various activities, including robbery and extortion.

- The Government of Mizoram initiated peace talks, and BNLF members surrendered on July 25, 2005. Another Bru insurgent group, the Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM), surrendered on October 26, 2006.

- A tripartite accord was signed on August 10, 2019, between the Government of India, the Government of Tripura, and the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) to end the insurgency.

- The remaining faction of NLFT, along with the All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF), signed a peace accord with the Government of India and the Government of Tripura on September 4, 2024, ending the 35-year-old insurgency in Tripura.

- On 2025, Phillip Ryoung started a new Bru Insurgent groups called Tripura Ham Bagra TA Army consisting of around 50 members.

**THBTA's Objectives and Activities**

- _Main Objective :_ THBTA aims to carve out North Tripura District from Tripura and form a Bru state.

- _Cadre Strength :_ THBTA has an estimated 50 personnel, including 20 Brus from Mizoram.

- _Firearms :_ THBTA possesses at least two firearms, with reports suggesting an increase in their arsenal.

- _Camps :_ THBTA has camps at Old Zopui and New Zopui under Baghaichhari PS, Rangamati District, Bangladesh.

- _Extortion :_ THBTA has made financial demands among contractors in Tripura and has started engaging in extortion among the Brus in Tripura.

**Potential Threats to Mizoram**

- _Recruitment :_ THBTA may conduct recruitment among Brus in Mizoram, potentially disrupting the peaceful condition of the state.

1. **Developments in Thaidawr Tlang Border Dispute**

1. **Resumption of construction work at Thaidawr Tlang by Tripura Government and MZP’s visit:**On 16th April, 2025, (Wednesday) the MZP General Headquarters President and five others visited Thaidawr Hill, Phuldungsei, to inspect the site where the Tripura State Tourism Department started constructing a building two years ago. However, they only managed to complete the pillars before the Tripura Forest Department objected, and now the Forest Department has taken further action.

 **Key Observations**_:_

i) _Construction Site_: The Tripura Forest Department has built an RCC quarter near the entrance gate of Thaidawr Hill.

ii) _Structures on the Hill_: Two structures, each 12(twelve) feet high and 10 square feet wide, are being built on the hill, but it's unclear whether they're meant to be waiting sheds or temples.

iii) _Watch Tower_: The existing watchtower is being demolished to make way for a new one.

 MZP Leaders' Visit: The MZP leaders inspected the site and returned around 1:00 p.m. via the Thaidawr route, exiting through Kawrtethawveng. In Phuldungsei, they had an informal discussion with Village Council members and Mizo Convention members of Jampui Hills, Tripura including the Treasurer, and thereafter toured Thaidawr Hill.

 Future Plans: The MZP leaders stated that they'll wait and observe the Mizoram Government's actions, and if no progress is made, they may organize a joint effort or hnatlang. The OC of Vanghmun, Tripura, sent three constables to Phuldungsei to monitor the situation. No disturbances or issues were reported.

 Background: Thaidawr Hill is a disputed area between Mizoram and Tripura, with Tripura attempting to develop it, but progress has been slow. Recently, they've made some progress, and the MZP has already discussed this matter with the Chief Minister.

 MZP General Headquarters Aizawl issued a Press Release in connection with their visit, dated 16th April, 2025, stating that its leaders visited Thaidawr Hill, Phuldungsei, to inspect the Tripura Government's construction activities within Mizoram territory.

The MZP expressed difficulty understanding why the Tripura Government frequently intervenes in Mizoram's territory and urged the workers on-site to immediately stop all development work.

The MZP also requested the Mizoram Government to promptly instruct the Tripura Government to cease all its activities in the area. Furthermore, the MZP asked the Mizoram Government to monitor the construction of the link road to Thaidawr Hill. Home Minister has directed DC, Mamit to take initiatives with his Tripuar Counterpart and DC, Mamit requested DC, Tripura North to halt the work which was promptly followed. These construction works has been stopped and is not continued until today.

1. **Tripura Police erect makeshift check gate near Thaidawr gate:**On 25th May, 2025, (Sunday) two Tripura Police personnel were observed digging holes and erecting a makeshift check gate near the Thaidawr gate. When questioned about its purpose, they claimed it was just a temporary rope barrier and that they were acting on the orders of the Vanghmun Police Station OC. The Phuldungsei Village Council President (VCP) subsequently reported the matter to the Mamit Deputy Commissioner (DC). The work was halted the following day.****

**3. Explosion at Thaidawr Tlang Construction Site:**On 28th May, 2025, (Tuesday), at 02:40 a.m, an explosion occurred at the Tripura Government’s Forest Guest House construction site near Phuldungsei, Jampui Hills, within the disputed Mizoram-Tripura border region. The blast caused structural damage to nearby residences but resulted in no casualties or serious injuries. Both Mizoram and Tripura police have initiated investigations, with cases registered at Vanghmun Police Station (Tripura) and West Phaileng Police Station (Mizoram).

Local sources suspect that Songrongma Mthoh, an anti-Christian faction within the Bru community, may be responsible, possibly attempting to falsely implicate the Mizo community. Many Mizo’s in Tripura share this perspective, raising concerns about targeted actions in the region.

**4. Tripura Tourism Minister Addresses Border Tensions:**On 30th May, 2025, (Saturday), the Tripura Tourism Minister convened a meeting at Eden Tourist Lodge at Vanghmun, attended by key Tripura government officials, representatives from the Mizo Convention, and Phuldungsei Village Council. The Minister emphasized the completion of tourism projects at Thaidawr Tlang by September 2025, backed by a â‚¹70 crore budget for tourism development in Jampui Hill. He stressed the need for enhanced security measures following the recent bombing of a tourism building. The Minister noted that if a boundary commission determines Thaidawr Tlang falls under Mizoram’s jurisdiction, the completed projects would be transferred to Mizoram. Mizo Convention representatives advocated for a diplomatic resolution to the Mizoram-Tripura border dispute to ensure smooth project implementation and prevent further incidents.

****5. New Tripura Police Checkpoint Sparks Concerns:**On 2nd June, 2025, it was reported the establishment of a new Tripura Police checkpoint along the approach road to Phuldungsei, near the recently bombed Tripura Tourism building. It is located close to the damaged tourism facility, with four Tripura State Rifles (TSR) personnel stationed at the site and approximately 20 (twenty) additional TSR personnel deployed at an abandoned BSNL facility on the southern outskirts of Phuldungsei.**

On June 3, 2025, Tripura Police dismantled a bamboo checkpoint and sentry checkpoint on the Thaidawr mountain path in Phuldungsei. 

****6. MZP Raises Concerns over Thaidawr Tlang Development:**On 3rd June, 2025, MZP General Headquarters leaders met with Mizoram Home Minister Pu K. Sapdanga to discuss the Thaidawr Tlang area near Phuldungsei village. They expressed concerns over the Tripura government’s construction of a â‚¹30 million Guest House and the deployment of Tripura State Rifles. The MZP requested the deployment of Mizoram police to the area and thanked the Home Minister for his support. The Home Minister agreed to deploy Mizoram IR personnel, instructed Tripura to halt the Guest House construction, and ordered the dismantling of the checkpoint. The MZP commended the Home Minister’s actions and urged continued protection for the Mizo people and improvements to border roads.**

**H.** **Insurgency in Mizoram:**

1. **Hmar People's Convention (Democratic) and its Related Issues:**

 The Hmar People's Convention (Democratic) [HPC(D)] was established in 1996, with Lalhmingthanga Sanate from Khawlian, Mizoram, serving as its president. However, his 15-year leadership came to an end in September 2011 when he was impeached by the HPC(D) council for allegedly forming an alliance with the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) in Manipur. Consequently, H. Zosangbera took over as the new chairman of HPC(D), leading to a division within the organization into two factions: one led by H. Zosangbera and the other by Lalhmingthanga Sanate.

 Following negotiations with the Government of Mizoram, H. Zosangbera's faction publicly emerged during the Arms Surrender Ceremony at CTI, Sesawng on April 13, 2018. Meanwhile, Lalhmingthanga Sanate's faction remained inactive for a period but has recently resurfaced.

**Recent Activities of HPC (D)**

 Since late 2022, Lalhmingthanga Sanate of the HPC(D) has been issuing demand letters to various Village Councils within the HPC(D) demand areas, including Aizawl, Kolasib, and Saitual Districts. Additional demand letters were sent via WhatsApp in May and June 2023, threatening Village Council leaders with consequences if they failed to comply.

 On December 24, 2022, Lalhmingthanga Sanate was apprehended by the Assam Rifles and Assam Police in Cachar, Assam, and was found in possession of a .32 pistol and 48 live rounds of ammunition. He was released on bail from judicial custody on May 15, 2023.

 As long as Lalhmingthanga Sanate's armed group remains active across Mizoram, Manipur, and Assam, they are likely to gain strength by recruiting more volunteers. Moreover, some surrendered members from H. Zosangbera's faction might join them.

 Mizoram has been experiencing low-level insurgencies in its northeastern and northwestern regions. However, on April 2, 2018, the Government of Mizoram and the HPC(D) signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS), marking the end of over two decades of armed insurgency by the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony took place on April 12, 2018, with approximately 102 cadres and 12 council members of the HPC(D) surrendering. Nevertheless, the other faction of the HPC(D), led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate, has begun reorganizing and resurfacing, engaging in donation collection and fund extortion throughout 2022 and 2023.

**Cases registered against HPCD, Lalhmingthanga Sanate Faction (during 2022 to 2024) :**

1. No. of case registered –  31
2. No. of persons arrested  –  09
3. No. of Case disposed – 12
4. Pending Investigation – 19

1. **Challenges of Indian Railway Establishment in Sairang, Mizoram: A Detailed Report on the Inner Line Permit (ILP) System**

****

 As Indian Railway prepares to extend its services to Sairang, Mizoram, several socio-legal and administrative challenges have emerged. One of the most critical among them is the effective regulation and enforcement of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system, which protects the identity, culture, and demographic integrity of indigenous Mizo people.

1. Major Challenges Arising from the Railway Expansion

1. _Increase in Influx of Non-Locals_

 The railway connectivity will lead to an increase in the number of outsiders (tourists, workers, traders), making ILP enforcement more difficult. Without proper categorization and digitization, the current manual ILP system will be overwhelmed.

2. _Potential Surge in Crime_

 With enhanced connectivity, there is a high probability of increased criminal activity such as illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and human trafficking. An immediate deployment of Railway Protection Force (RPF) and establishment of local law enforcement units at Bairabi, Hortoki, Kawnpui , Mualkhang and Sairang stations is crucial.

3. _Overstaying ILP Holders and Missing Records_

 Many current ILP holders fail to renew their permits, and tracking overstays becomes a loophole for unlawful settlement and underground activities.

4. _Collapse of Local Transportation Business_

 The new railway line may severely affect the livelihoods of local truck drivers and transporters. A special rehabilitation and support forum is needed to resolve economic displacement issues.

II. Recommendations for Strengthening the ILP System in Light of Railway Expansion :

 To effectively manage the influx and associated risks, the following enhancements to the ILP system are recommended:

1. Digitization of ILP Process

• Online Application Portal &amp; App: A dedicated portal and mobile app should allow Non-Mizo citizens to apply for ILPs digitally, attach ID proofs, and generate a QR-coded ILP document.

• Authorities should scan and verify ILPs through handheld devices at railway stations and check gates.

2. Categorization of ILPs

• ILPs must be divided into:

*  Tourist ILP – Valid for &lt;30 days (renewable)

*  Worker ILP – Valid for 180 days (continuously renewable)

* Business ILP – Valid for 365 days (renewable annually)

• Each ILP should clearly mention category, sponsor’s details, address, and QR code for tracking.

3. Validity &amp; Renewal Dashboard

• A centralized ILP Dashboard must be developed and accessible by the police.

• Features must include:

* ILP holder’s name and full address

* Date of issue, expiry, and last payment

* Sponsor identity and address

* QR scan option to check validity and status

4. Enhanced Fee Collection

• Application fees should be increased based on category and duration.

• Payments should be made easier through Net Banking, UPI, Debit/Credit Cards.

• Use collected fees for setting up pushback and enforcement teams.

5. Enforcement on Sponsors and Overstay Penalties

• A strict sponsor limit should be introduced (e.g., max 3 ILP holders per sponsor).

• If an ILP is not renewed within 30 days, the sponsor will be fined and prosecuted.

• Daily fines for overstaying individuals should also be levied.

6. Institutional Setup

• A dedicated ILP Unit at DIG-level should be created.

• All SPs in the districts should operate District ILP Cells.

• RPF should work in coordination with Mizoram Police to check ILP compliance.

7. QR Code-Based Monitoring

Police and volunteers in Mizoram can scan QR codes to verify and track the holder’s location and sponsor.
