 During the course of threat perception assessment, sources and contacts, links and informants from insurgent groups operating in the adjoining interstate and international borders were contacted besides constantly monitoring their activities and movements.

It is also further learnt that threat perceived against various protected persons of the state Government from insurgent groups is minimal at the moment.
