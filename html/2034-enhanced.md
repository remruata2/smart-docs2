**In early November 2009, Henry called me up from somewhere in the jungle area near Mehdili, Assam and told me that he was in constant touch with the MBDPF leaders. According to Henry, the MBDPF leaders felt that the ongoing negotiation with the Mizoram Govt. would not bear fruit and their demands would remain unfulfilled. In view of this, the leaders felt that it would not be wise to repatriate the Bru refugees to Mizoram at this juncture. Hence, drastic measures have to be taken up to sabotage the repatriation. Henry conveyed through phone the wish of the MBDPF leaders to me and Lalthazuala who was at the Asapara. Lalthazuala in turn asked me to come out of the DHD camp and meet him at Asapara. However, Henry warned that no good weapons(rifle, automatic weapons) must be used or else. It will create the impression of the handwork of an organized outfit endangering their future. Thus, Henry told us to do as we see fit for follow-up action self contacted/recruited some reliable youth and visited villages. When I was in Silchar, Mizoram Police arrested me at Silchar on 12.1.2010@ 0500 hrs. and seized the following articles from us :-**

**1. ULA(United Liberation Army) Seal -2 nos.**

**2. BRO(Bru Re-Unification Organisation) Donation Receipt - 2 Books.**
