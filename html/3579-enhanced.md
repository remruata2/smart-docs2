**ACB to probe allegagation against Chief Minister:** In pursuance of complaint submitted by Mizoram First Movement (MFM) , Lokayukta directed Mizoram Anti corruption Bureau (ACB) to conduct investigation against Chief Minister, Pu Zoramthanga on the alleged irregularities in the renovation works of Lengpui Airport.

 MFM had earlier accused the Chief Minister, who is also PWD Minister of violating Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, Section 162 of General Finance Rules (GFR) 2017, various notification issued by Vigilance Department and showing nepotism to closed relatives. The MFM had requested Lokayukta to book the Chief Minister under Prevention of Corruption Act,1988 who in turn directed Anti Corruption Bureau to probe into the matter as they (Lokayukta) had no investigating agency of their own.
