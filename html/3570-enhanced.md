**Mass casual leave by NHM workers:**  Employees under National Health Mission (NHM) decided to launch mass casual leave w.e.f 11-13 July 2022 in protest against the non-implementation of their demands by the Government. The demands of NEUM (NHM Employees Union Mizoram) are :

 1.To receive salaries regularly

 2.Creation of ways for their regularisation

 3.Medical reimbursement facilities

 4.Enjoyment of transfer TA

 5.Special consideration for NHM contractual staff for vacant post under Health Department

According to the statement released by NEUM, a Study Group was constituted back in 2021 to look into their plights. However, nothing has been done despite the report of the Study Group being submitted in April 2022. Only the Chief Minister, Dy.Chief Minister and Chief Secretary have read this report so far and did not even reach the concerned Health Department.
