But in recent times regarding certain issues Mizoram Police appeared to be failing in maintaining confidentiality, they seemed to be giving out information about confidential cases to the public secretly. The authorities need to be cautious about this; Police are meant to work for the public and employed by the government for that purpose. </span></span></span></span></p>

They have to do this so the public know they are reliable and responsible Police.</span></span></span></span></p>
