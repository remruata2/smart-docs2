2. **Pu.Lalnuntluanga,**Chairman Local Council, Govt. Complex stated that PuV.Lalfakzuala is mentally unstable.

5. **Inspr.RinthangaRalte**, CID (SB) stated that he was also present while SI J.H.Chunglianthanga conducted interrogation at CID Office Field Room. He did not find any unlawful manner committed by SI Maliana while conducting interrogation against Pu. V.Lalfakzuala. On that day, Pu. V Lalfakzuala left the office without any issue.

**FINDINGS:**

**S.I JH Chunglianthanga** was endorsed to enquire about the letter to the President of India sent by one person calling himself Hminga Pa, vide No. MSB/CB/B-01/40 dt 16.1.2018. As per instruction from superior officers, inquiry was first done at Synod Hospital, Durtlang, after which the sender of the letter, Mr. V. Lalfakzuala was summoned and examined as per legal procedure.

According to the statements of Synod Hospital officials, Mr. V. Lalfakzuala was an in-patient on 23/12/2010 and 17/8/2016 and he was given treatment for gastric problems. All the staff nurses who attended to him viz. Loisy, Elizabeth, Tetei, Tei, Esther and Ruthi were also thoroughly examined but they denied all allegations of having sex as mentioned in the letter.

According to patient record file, V. Lalfakzuala(Faka) is a resident of Govt. Complex, LuangmualVeng and he was a Sub-Inspector rank officer who went on voluntary retirement in 2015 due to mental illness. After obtaining his phone number and his service records from 3IR Bn., he was requested to appear at CID (SB) office. However, he declined the request stating that he will not appear without proper summons. Hence he was served summons by PuLalbiakzauva, the then DySP(Field).

As per instruction from superior officers, PuFaka was picked up from his residence with the help of police personnel of Zonuam Outpost. He was brought to Zonuam Outpost where his specimen handwriting was taken for handwriting identification. After that, he was brought to CID (SB) office. As indicated in the Summon No.91/160, PuFaka was examined at the office field room and Joseph Lalnunmawia was also present. He stated that his wife committed adultery which that the nurses- Loisy, Elizabeth and Tetei loved him very much but had to say ‘Bye Bye forever’ due to interference of John. During his interrogation, CID (SB) staff did not use any impolite language or intimidating words and he was not physically assaulted in any way. Since it was evident that he was mentally disturbed, it was felt there was no need to carry on the investigation any further.

Since all the CID (SB) field officers who examined PuFaka were convinced that he was mentally unstable, they consider the investigation to be completed. Further, the male nurse Joseph Lalnunmawia who was summoned to the office also stated that the accusations of PuFaka that he slept with the nurses was a lie and that since he is a married man, it was very embarrassing for him. Although Joseph was very furious at the beginning, he quickly understood that PuFaka was mentally ill and hence he was actually sympathetic towards him at the end.

S.I. J.H. Chunglianthanga even contacted the different parties, the female nurses, the male nurse and the Hospital authorities, involved by V.Lalfakzuala and requested them not to take the matter seriously on behalf of Pu V.Lalfakzuala since he was considered to be having mental problem. The Hospital authorities were very offended as they felt the accusations brought and embarrassment and disrepute to the hospital. However, they did not take any action after it was explained to them that it was an action of a person who was mentally ill.

On the day 18/1/2018, Mr. V Lalfakzuala left the office in the evening without any issue and inquiry report was duly prepared and submitted to Dy. SP (Field). He is disappointed that Pu V Lalfakzuala, who is considered by the public to be a mentally ill person, could create so much trouble for the police.

Since the superior officer directed me to enquire the matter, I requested SI Chunglianthanga to enquire whether PuV.Lalfakzuala was available or not at his residence. He contacted Pu.V.Lalsiamaf/oPuV.Lalfakzuala to ask about his son. We learnt that V.Lalfakzuala submitted a complaint again to DGP against SI Chunglianthanga regarding the phone call received on that day. The letter was forwarded to DIG (CID) by DIG (NR) vide letter No. R/CR0-47(Police)/2019/31, dated 10.1.2019 requesting conduct of discreet enquiry and submission of report at the earliest.Regarding the latter complaint by V.Lalfakzuala, SI Chunglianthanga made a call from CID Office and did not use any impolite language or intimidating words. A few minutes later he received a message from Pu. V.Lalfakzuala which he showed to me. But he did not even reply the message as he already knew about his mental illness.

 **PuV.Lalfakzuala** stated that the unlawful manner of SI JH.Chunglianthanga in his interrogation conducted against him on 18.1.2018 were-

1. While interrogation was conducted at CID Office, John got angry and he pulled up his sleeves and said how he wished to torture PuV.Lalfakzuala. They can let him said such word was unlawful.

ii)  Summon was served based on CrPC 91/160 and he was interrogated as a culprit. He thought that it was unlawful and serving summon based on such sections were incorrect from his knowledge.

1. At Zonuam Outpost, The way Maliana talked to him wasvery rude and he disrespected him.
2. When they arrived CID SB Complex Maliana wanted to lookthe on- going construction of MPSOA building. Malian told his subordinates to take him to the office even without mentioning his name. He thought that Malianadidn’t respect him as an ex-General Secretary of MPSOA.

The above points he had mentioned were found to be baseless. V. Lalfakzuala demanded to be summoned and summon was served tohim u/s 161 CrPC. It appeared that V.Lalfakzuala, being an ex-policeman and with mental illness, took offence against J.H. Chunglianthanga as he was the main person who came in contact with him. Being an ex-OB of MPSOA, he might have expected to be given special treatment and the normal treatment seemed to have hurt his ego. He further stated that he did all this things because he wanted to be re-employed as a Police SI in Mizoram Police and he thought that DGP is the one who can solve all his problems.

**CONCLUSION:**

  From the statements of PuV.Lalfakzuala, SI JH Chunglianthanga, Joseph Lalrinmawia, and testimonial letters from leaders of local NGO I foundthat the allegation made by Pu V Lalfakzuala against SI JH Chunglianthanga regarding the unlawful manner of conducting interrogation was baseless from the legal point of view and it was done by a mentally unstable person in order to get attention of the Police authorities.

 The additional allegation he made against S.I. J.H. Chunglianthanga is considered not worthy to be taken seriously. The S.I. called the father of V. Lalfakzuala to confirm his availability so that he could be examined in connection with his previous complaint. His accusations appeared to be a figment of his overheated imagination.
