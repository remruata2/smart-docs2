<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears certain at the moment that ISIS and its ideological siblings will engage in a long-drawn-out war over their competing world views and interests. The long-term consequences of protracted intra-Islamic conflict will have grave repercussions for the region and the world. The success of ISIS has led regime-backed&nbsp;<em>mullahs&nbsp;</em>to come out with denunciation of ISIS ideology and its political intent to raise a Caliphate. Even some other radical outfits have dismissed the arguments of ISIS and declared its Caliphate un-Islamic. However, the success of ISIS has led the Sunnis in the region to believe that there is an opportunity for them to strike back.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since the success of the Shi&rsquo;ite Islamic revolution in Iran, there is a long-running desire for an equivalent Islamic revolution in the Sunni fold. ISIS feeds them with the hope that it is possible to redraw the map of the region. In their latest video distributed by Al-Hayat as well as in their newsletter (Islamic State Report No 4) under the caption &ldquo;Smashing of the borders of the Tawaghit&rdquo;, they have clearly stated that the wrongs committed by Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916 dividing the Islamic Caliphate into territories under possession of the colonial powers &mdash; which has given rise to the present State system in West Asia &mdash; would be reversed.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It remains to be seen how the people of the region &mdash; long used to territorial identities of Saudi, Iraqi, Syrian, Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian etc- would ultimately react to such formulations. Going by the initial reactions and migration of about 7,000 Sunni fighters from Pakistan-Afghanistan and four Indians from Kalyan in Mumbai, the appeal of ISIS is for all to see. Rise of ISIS and its emphasis on sectarian thinking is likely to widen the sectarian divisions in the wider Islamic society, including in India, and lead to violence and bloodshed unprecedented in Islamic history.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This may not be good news for India, home to a substantial number of Muslim population &mdash; in fact the third largest concentration of Muslims in the world. The Sunni-Shia divisions were so far lying dormant in India. However, in recent months, reports of thousands of Shias seeking visas to go to Iraq to defend their places of worship can be an indicator of how far the sectarian animus can affect tranquility at home.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add to that the effect of chronic instability in the region on India&rsquo;s energy and economic interests. Roughly 70 lakh Indians working in the region send back about $35-40 billion as remittances, which serve our economy well. A huge percentage of our hydrocarbon is sourced to this region as well. Consequences of ISIS storm hitting West Asia would, therefore, not be in Indian interest. Other energy-hungry countries in Asia like China would also not be happy about it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

These pamphlets invite citizens of both Afghanistan and Pakistan to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-declared caliph of ISIS, and join the jihad against non-believers.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just three weeks after the pamphlets began appearing, it was reported that ISIS aligned militants&nbsp;launched&nbsp;their first brutal offensive in Afghanistan&#39;s central province of Ghazni alongside Taliban fighters, which left more than 100 people dead. Carrying the black flags of ISIS, they overran several villages, beheaded fifteen family members of local police officers, and burned at least 60 homes. This was a shocking incident to many observers in Afghanistan, as they believed Afghanistan is out of the range and off the agenda of ISIS.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ISIS&#39;s encroachment into Pakistan and Afghanistan comes at a time when extremism and the violence waged under such ideology, might be at its peak in both countries. At the same time, political deadlocks caused by the struggle over power combined with the failure of the governments in both countries and the wider region to respond to the legitimate aspirations of their people have significantly undermined the government&#39;s legitimacy in both countries, thus calling into question the very concept of modern nation states.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why has ISIS chosen to reach out to this region, bypassing the many other nations bordering its current stronghold in Syria and Iraq?</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consistent failure of secular governments in Afghanistan and Pakistan to deliver security, justice, and public services for the citizens has contributed to growing space for extremism and sympathy for alternative forms of government. This state of affairs has turned the environment conducive for acceptance of an alternative, even a hardline Caliphate - which ISIS has proclaimed and promised to impose across the Muslim world. ISIS regularly boasts of its efficiency in delivering justice and public services in their propaganda campaign.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A struggle over the global leadership of jihadi movements will encourage non-ISIS militant groups to attempt to demonstrate their relevance and attract attention at a time when ISIS is consistently dominating world headlines. The competition could result in expansion of terror, violence, and extremism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and beyond. In fact, many believe that Zawahiri&#39;s&nbsp;recent announcement&nbsp;that it had established an al Qaeda branch in India is both a pre-emptive move and a direct reaction to the growing influence and fame of ISIS. The new group would allow al Qaeda to raise its profile among wealthy donors in the Middle East, maintain its global relevance, and also recruit new volunteers in the South Asian region. Yet ISIS&#39;s organization, efficiency, and public relations capabilities are far better than that of al Qaeda and other militant groups, making ISIS the more attractive group in the eyes of extremists in the region, particularly the more radical, younger generation of violent extremists.</span></span></span></span></p>

As past experience shows, any quick-fix solution and incomprehensive approach is doomed to fail. The struggle against ISIS is ideological and political. ISIS will not be eliminated unless the radical ideology is fought by means of soft power, meaningful measures taken to halt systematic radicalization, and crucially, issues of governance and justice are addressed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, killing violent extremists with hard power by bombs and rockets, like what the United States and some allied countries began, is one element of the solution but it can by no means address the root causes of the problem. In fact, utilizing excessive hard power can generate sympathy towards the extremists amongst the general population.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a bit surprising that despite millennia of interaction with Islam and the Middle East, India hardly seems to understand or know about either Islam or the conflicts that are erupting in the Islamic world. It is almost as though India believes that by adopting an ostrich-like attitude (burying its head in the sand and hoping the storm will pass it by) it will remain unaffected (at least domestically, if not internationally) by the dynamics of what is happening in the Islamic world.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:4px; margin-right:-45px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="background-color:white"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope can never be a substitute for policy, but for now it seems to guide our policy towards the region. We tend to hope that ISIS&rsquo;s ultra-radical overtures would repel Islamic societies and force them to stand up to its virulence. But chances of that happening are quite bleak because such is the nature of the beast that divisions among States on sectarian lines (Saudi Arab-Iran for instance) might keep the flame alive.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

The challenge before India is enormous, but the trust that the people of the country have reposed in the Government needs to be vindicated.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
