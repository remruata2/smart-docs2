ZOMI REVOLUTIONARY ARMY (ZRA) EASTERN COMMAND :

 The operational areas of ZRA Eastern Command, who are commanded by SS Colonel Kham Min Thang includes the areas around Tidim,Tonzang and Chikha inside Myanmar.

 For a long period, ZRA had prohibited the establishment of any armed group within their operational areas. However, after the creation of Civil Disobedience Movement as a result of the 2021 military coup of Myanmar, several armed groups have sprung up which includes People Defence Force (PDF) Zoland inside the operational areas of ZRA. This greatly displeased ZRA who strongly opposed the activities of PDF Zoland, often resulting in threats and even violence against these PDF Zoland members.
