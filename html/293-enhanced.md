 The Deputy Inspector General of Police (NR)

 Mizoram, Aizawl

Subject: Security for State BJP Office, Aizawl - Regarding.

Ref. : No.DIG(NR)/REQ/2018/142 Dt.17th December, 2019

Sir,

 In compliance to your letter no. and subject mentioned above, threat perception assessment in respect of BJP Office, Aizawl was conducted as for which sources and contacts, informants and acquaintances were approached from several Political Parties, NGOs and Civil Society Organisations which could have a bearing on the current security scenario.

 It is concluded that no direct threat in regard to BJP Office, Aizawl was perceived from organisations either from student bodies or NGOs who have had spearheaded protests against the passage of the Citizenship Ammendment Act (CAA). Despite several rounds of peaceful protest staged against CAA within Aizawl City, it is pertinent to note that it had limited itself to peaceful means and leaders doing the rounds of convincing its members to resort to protest in a non-violent approach only.

 However, isolated and unorganised incident wherein wayward youths having no affiliation to any particular organisation or having no thorough knowledge of the issue either, resorting to some violent action towards BJP Office as a way to vent their anger against the passage of the Citizenship Ammendment Act (CAA) could not be ruled out at the moment.

 Submitted for kind information and further necessary action please.

Yours faithfully

**(K.LALREMSANGA)**
