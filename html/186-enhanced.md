 Apropos the above, I am sending herewith the assessment report and recommendation in respect of Pu Andrew Lalherliana, Chairman, MPSC for your kind information and necessary action.

 SI Johnny Rengsi, CID(SB) has conducted the assessment of threat perception of Pu Andrew Lalherliana. During the process of assessment, it is learnt that Mizo Students Union (MSU) that had spearheading agitation against his appointment as Chairman, MPSC had given-up their protest against him due to his near retirement on 31st October, 2015. No imminent threat has been perceived against him at the moment. However, it is suggested that his scale of security may be reviewed.
