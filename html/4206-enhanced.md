Sir,

****With due respect, I have the honour to submit herewith assessment of prevailing situation over opening of rental car booking counter at Lengpui Airport and activities undertaken by All Mizoram Car Rental Association (AMCRA) in its efforts to acquire and operate the said counter at Lengpui Airport. It is to be mentioned that despite obtaining permission from the General Administration Department (Aviation), its materialisation has been marred by spate of obstruction and opposition from Lengpui NGOs and Lengpui Taxi Welfare till date.

**I. Activities of All Mizoram Car Rental Association (AMCRA) in pursuit of operating Rental Car Booking Counter at Lengpui Airport.**

**27.02.2024** - AMCRA had been persuing to set up Car Rental Counter for its members for quite sometime. In this regard its leaders had urged the concern authority on several occasions for its approval.

 **01.04.2024** - AMCRA intended to inaugurate its Rental Counter which was strongly objected by Lengpui Taxi Welfare Association supported by Lengpui All NGOs. The inauguration programme was cancelled.

 **03.04.2024** - AMCRA was set to open the Counter again which it failed to materialise oweing to security reasons arising from Lengpui Taxi Welfare and its NGOs.

** **02.05.2024** - AMCRA leaders approached Pu Rahool Alwal, SP, Aizawl and sought security arrangement for its opening of Rental Counter scheduled on dt.03.05.2024. Pu Rahool Alwal had suggested that he would discuss the matter with the Secretary, State Transport Authority (STA).**

 AMCRA cancelled its inauguration of Rental Counter as SP, Aizawl could not provide security arrangement for its scheduled programme.

** **09.05.2024** - Pu Saidenga, Deputy Controller, Lengpui Airport held meeting with AMCRA leaders at their office wherein he suggested that a joint meeting be held with Lengpui Taxi Welfare Association. He also informed them that Lengpui Taxi Welfare had proposed that AMCRA be allowed to operate 6 (six) rental cars daily at Lengpui Airport.**

** **16.05.2024** - AMCRA held executive meeting at its office wherein it deliberated upon the proposal made by Lengpui Taxi Welfare in allowing to operate 6 (six) rental cars daily. The meeting resolved that the number of rental cars to operate daily be proposed to 10 (ten) in the upcoming joint meeting.**

** **17.05.2024** - AMCRA and Lengpui Taxi Welfare Association held a meeting at the office of Pu Saidenga, Deputy Controller, Lengpui Airport. The meeting ended without amicable solution as Lengpui Taxi Welfare rejected the proposal of AMCRA to operate 10 (ten) rental cars daily. Lengpui Taxi Welfare reiterated that operating separate rental counter is not acceptable and would continue to obstruct it.**

 **18.05.2024** - Lengpui All NGO meeting was held wherein it resolved its firm support for Lengpui Taxi Welfare and vowed it would not allow operation of rental cars counter at Lengpui Airport.

 In the course of assessment, leaders and members of Lengpui Taxi Welfare were contacted and approached. Members of Lengpui Village Councils and NGOs leaders as well as several villagers were contacted. It is learnt that Lengpui Taxi Welfare Association members were adamant in objecting and are against the  operationofseparate Rental Car Booking Counter solely for AMCRA members at Lengpui Airport.

 It is also learnt that Lengpui Taxi Welfare had the backing of Lengpui NGOs in their efforts and is very likely that they would show up in support of them in protesting against the opening of the said counter.

 It is to be mentioned that AMCRA executive meeting held on dt.25.06.2024 at 7:30 pm at the office had rejected the suggestion made by Lengpui NGOs that AMCRA members share the same counter with Lengpui Taxi Welfare.
