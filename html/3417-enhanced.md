**BSF stopped Mizoram Police Agent/Abducted will not be arriving today****:** Sanglianthanga and Lalzamliana who were abducted and detained by Bru armed gang for 52 days and released on 15th January 2014 (Wednesday) will not be arriving Mizoram today as expected. The agent/Mizoram representative who was to fetch Sanglianthanga and Lalzawmliana was blocked/stopped by Border Security Force (BSF) duty at Silsuri Post.

 Sanglianthanga and Lalzamliana are still in the forest of Bangladesh and Mizoram Police hired Bangladeshi agent for guide and he departed towards Bangladesh yesterday.

 After the agent left the border, BSF duty at Silsuri Post called him back and detained him for 7 hours; Pu HL Thangzuala, Addl. SP CID(SB) had a talk with the BSF after that the agent went towards Bangladesh at around 2:30pm yesterday and he arrived the place last night where the abducted are.

 As the place where the abducted are waiting for their rescuer is a forest, it is not possible to go out at night; they will be coming towards Mizoram this morning and are expected to arrive Mizoram tomorrow.

 Mizoram Police are very angry at BSF for stopping their agent and even reprimanded the heads of BSF.
