Dated: 13th August, 2020.

 A joint meeting of leaders of the 3 (three) Autonomous District Councils of Mizoram (LADC, MADC &amp; CADC), All Party and All NGOs was held under the chairmanship of Pu Zirsanga, Chairman, LADC, today, i.e., 13.8.2020 at the Conference Hall of CEM, Lawngtlai. The meeting condemned and expressed disappointment over the non-inclusion of leaders of Autonomous District Councils under main Article in the Warrant of Precedence issued by the General Administration Department (Protocol &amp; Hospitality Wing), Government of Mizoram on 11.8.2020. Their inclusion in Note 7 of the said Warrant of Precedence, which placed them at par with Secretaries to the Government of Mizoram, Special Secretaries to the Government and others listed in Article 12 of the said Warrant when invited to State and ceremonial functions, was considered to be unjustifiable.
 The meeting prepared a letter addressed to the Hon’ble Chief Minister requesting for inclusion of leaders of Autonomous District Councils in the corresponding main Article of Warrant as under :-

| **Article of Warrant** | **Name of the Posts** |
| --- | --- |
| 6 | Chief Executive Member of Autonomous District Councils |
| 7 | Chairman of Autonomous District Councils |
| 8 | Deputy Chairman, Executive Members &amp; equivalent ranks of Autonomous District Councils |
| 10 | Member of District Councils |


 They requested the Hon’ble Chief Minister to make necessary amendment as per the above suggestion. They further stated that they should not be held responsible if they celebrate National Days separately if the Government take no positive action before 15.8.2020.

 The meeting was attended by CEM of LADC and MADC; Chairman, CADC and other 16 (sixteen) persons.

 Situation is under close watch.
