Subject : Threat perception report of Raj Bhavan

Sir,

 As per your order, enquiries of threat perception of Raj Bhavan was conducted and my findings are as under -

 The securities of Aizawl Raj Bhavan complex is put under the responsibilities of 225 Bn. CRPF, who deployed one company for it. Apart from CRPF personnel, S.P., Security, Mizoram deployed 1Inspector, 1 Sub-Inspector,1 Assistant Sub-Inspector,15 Head Constables/Havilders,1 Naik and 3 Constables in Raj Bhavan. Security unit staffs conducted day and night surveillances while CRPF personnel manned the sentry posts scattered around the complex.

 At present, no imminent threat against the safety of the Governor is found to exist from any under ground/ militants or other NGO groups. However, certain suggestions for improving the securities of Raj Bhavan and the Governor himself mentioned under may be considered -

 a) Proper Identification Card for all the staffs may be issued, even temporarily to all construction workers inside the compound.

 b) Visibilities from the various sentry posts are limited by different over-grown trees and bushes.

 c) Proper fencing can be erected between Secretariat Annex-1 and CRPF barrack.

 d) Inspite of the presence of CRPF sentry, the gate for the approach to the Commanding Officer's office is too low which is accessible by any outsiders with ease

 e) The area around the Aizawl Centenary anniversary stone pillar is not visible from sentry post No.3. This area is also easily accessible by any outsiders, street urchins, drug addicts and the like since its gate has not been properly locked.
