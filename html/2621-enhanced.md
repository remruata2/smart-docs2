****Investigation Report****

 The accused Thangchina s/o Lalthawmpianga, Thangliana s/o Thanlin and Tawkhleisanga s/o Tuanirha all of Chekan, Myanmar were apprehended by Zokhawthar Police on 15.11.05 and the above listed arms and ammunitions were seized from their possession.

 Interrogation of the three arrested persons revealed that one of the accused Thangchina s/o Lalthawmpianga went to Suili on the Myanmar – China border and acquired the above mentioned arms and ammunitions from one Chinese shopkeeper named Chen Chen. He moved these arms and ammunitions towards Mizoram intending to sell it there through his friend Vanchema @ Vantea of Myanmar P/A Aizawl for a good profit. On the way he hired two porters from his native village Chekan, their name being Thangliana and Tawkhleisanga and who were arrested along with him, carried the consignment from Haimual towards Zokhawthar on foot. After the three persons crossed the river Tiau and reached Zokhawthar they were arrested by the Zokhawthar police.

 It appears that the two porters did not know that they were carrying illegal arms and ammunitions. It was known how Thangchina acquired these items but the final destination of neither the arms nor ammunitions was known. No information about the apparent middleman Vanchema @ Vantea was known or the possible buyers, he was in contact with.

**PREVIOUS DEALING OR INVOLVEMENT:**His involvement in the past in arms smuggling case was not known**.**
