No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/145

Dated: 28th February, 2019.

Information has been received that 4 (four) Bru NGOs, viz. Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Forum (MBDPF), Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Coordination Committee (MBDPCC), Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement (MBIDM) and Bru Tribal Development Society (BTDS) held a joint meeting today, i.e. 29.02.2019 @ 12:00 noon at MBDPF office at Naisingpara Bru Camp which was presided over by A. Sawibunga, President, MBDPF and attended by 32 (thirty two) members. The joint meeting deliberated on repatriation and the various demands made to the Central and Mizoram Governments which they claimed have still been unfulfilled.

The meeting held extensive discussion on their biggest demand, i.e. creation of Bru Autonomous District Council and decided to cease their demand for its creation as they felt that it will never be accepted by the Mizo people and the Mizoram Government.

The meeting decided to come to Aizawl at the earliest opportune time to meet the Hon’ble Chief Minister, Ministers and Officials of the Government of Mizoram regarding their various demands. The timing and the representatives will be decided on their next meeting to be held on 04.03.2019 at the same venue.
