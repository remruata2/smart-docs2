****NOTES ON PREVAILING DRUG SITUATION IN MIZORAM****

**Introduction:**

** Mizoram has a long international boundary with two countries (496.53 kms with Myanmar and 319.79 kms with Bangladesh) and 284 kms of inter-state boundaries with three other north-eastern states – Assam, Tripura and Manipur. Interestingly Mizoram lies at the periphery of the Golden Triangle historically known for its drug manufacturing and trade. Mizoram has porous international border****with Myanmar and Bangladesh, the rough terrain, lack of proper connectivity poses a huge challenge to security forces at the border areas, it hampers their movement and limit their ability to check drug trafficking and to rapidly respond to attempts made by criminals.**

**Prevailing drug situation in Mizoram:**

 There has been an increase in illegal cross-border drug smuggling in recent years and Mizoram has become a favorable transit route for transporting them to other parts of the country. Major drugs trafficked into Mizoram are heroin, methamphetamine, ganja, pseudoephedrine and codeine based cough syrup. The routes of drugs trafficked in Mizoram are as follows:

1. Heroin is smuggled mainly from Myanmar and Assam for local consumption.
2. Methamphetamine (Yaba tablets) are smuggled from Myanmar through Mizoram for transporting to mainland and neighbouring country like Bangladesh.
3. Ganja is smuggled mainly from Manipur and other parts of mainland India for local consumption.
4. There is reverse trafficking of Pseudoephedrine, which are smuggled from mainland India through Mizoram into Myanmar. The smuggled Pseudoephedrine is used for preparation of Methamphetamine and the finished products i.e. Methamphetamine tablets were smuggled back into Mizoram from Myanmar for further distribution in the mainland and Bangladesh. Last seizure of Pseudoephedrine was in July, 2019.

**Reasons:**

 The following points may be the reasons of drugs trafficking in Mizoram:-

1. Insufficient border guards to check cross-trafficking along the Indo-Myanmar border
2. Demands among the local populace
3. Mizoram being a peaceful state, drug trafficker take advantage of it.

**Strategy for combating drug trafficking:**

In addition to the above, Mizoram police has adopted the following strategy to combat drugs trafficking in Mizoram:

1. A booklet on detailed strategy for combating smuggling and trafficking of drugs in Mizoram was drawn up and circulated to all concerned for taking actions as per the strategy laid down in the book.
2. Awareness Campaigns have been frequently conducted in border villages along the Mizoram-Myanmar border.
3. Special Awareness Programmes for Hotel Owners and Managers are organised in Aizawl.
4. A short clip/video was prepared featuring the local celebrities and were circulated through various social media platforms on ‘International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking’ on June 26.
5. Information regarding seizure of drugs and conviction of offenders are promptly uploaded on social media by Mizoram Police Social Media Cell and also disseminated through other media channels by Public Relations Officer.
6. A ‘Canine Squad’ has been set up by Mizoram Police with the assistance from NCB for narcotic control. These canine are stationed at different District Executive Force unit and Battalions, they have been utilized on need basis.

**Conclusion:**

Though Mizoram Police has made tremendous efforts in fight against illicit drugs and arrest of traffickers over the years, the drugs menace in the state has not been abated till date. It is the need of the hour to strengthen the police force in all possible ways and it is expected that strengthening of police with modern equipment, monetary resources etc. would be vital for curbing the drugs menace in the state.
