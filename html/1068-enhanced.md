****THREAT PERCEPTION ASSESSMENT REPORT IN RESPECT OF CHAKMA HOUSE, AIZAWL.****

 Presently, 7(2+5) personnel of Mizoram Home Guards are deployed for static guard duty at Chakma House, Aizawl. In addition to these Home Guards, 8(2+6) personnel of 5th IR Bn. were deployed after Zomuantlang incident where some Chakma miscreants assaulted IR personnel on duty and they were withdrawn in the month of Oct.,2020.

 During the course of enquiry, it was learnt that whenever there is a communal misunderstanding between Mizos and Chakmas in any part of the State, there were instances where agitated members of Mizo NGOs or Students' Organisations entered into the premises of Chakma House, Aizawl without much difficulties inspite of the presence of the static guards.

 At the moment, no imminent threat is perceived against Chakma House, Aizawl. However, taking into account instances of previous incidents and the fact that tension could erupt between Mizo and Chakma communities at any moment, deployment of CRPF or other Armed Police Force in addition to the existing MRHG personnel in the said Chakma House is suggested.
