****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/192

Dated: 15th March, 2019.

1. In what appears to be an obvious manifestation of dissent in the HPC(D) organisation, Lalkhama @ L.K. Hmar, purportedly assuming or styling himself as Commander-in-Chief issued a statement today, i.e. 15.3.2019, indicating that he, along with other 4 (four) named Commanders, no longer accept the leadership of L. Sanga Hmar, Chairman of HPC(D), Manipur Region. Lalkhama @ L.K. Hmar is former Public Relation Officer (PRO) of the outfit, who was among the 63 (sixty three) Cadres who had laid down weapons following Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) signed between the Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) on 2.4.2018. Calling L. Sanga Hmar a self-proclaimed leader and a dictator, they have also accused him of misappropriating Rs. 50,40,000/- deducted from Rehabilitation packages of 63 (sixty three) cadres @ Rs. 80,000/- each meant for distribution to the bereaved families of Cadres who had died earlier after spending Rs. 15 Lakhs for purchasing weapons for use of cadres of Manipur Region. The statement further accused L. Sanga of indulging in the internal affairs of ZRA by siding with the group led by Calvin H, Ex-Vice President of ZRA/ZRO, which they contended is detrimental to the safety of Hmar community, and which is also against the will of various Hmar NGOs and Churches. Names of the Commanders are as under:-

1. Mr. L.K. Hmar, Commander in Chief
2. Mr. Thangsiem, Commander
3. Mr. L.D. Hmar, Commander
4. Mr. Peka Hmar, Commander
5. Mr. R. Lalbieklien, Commander

 Input deduced from reliable source indicated that Lalkhama @ L.K. Hmar with his cadres, who were known to be former cadres of Mizoram Region who had since surrendered, had been siding with the deposed ZRO President, Thanglianpau and were being used by the latter in a plot to assassinate their rival leader, Calvin.

 Having been supplied with arms by the ZRA, the move by dissident group of HPC(D) led by L.K. Hmar now appears to be an attempt to take control of the entire Hmar dominated areas of Manipur, with a diktat to the people to stop paying any sort of Tax to group led by L. Sanga Hmar. Source further indicated that the emergence of this group is politically motivated which could be linked with interested party or individual, and the whole episode being related with the ensuing Parliamentary Election.
