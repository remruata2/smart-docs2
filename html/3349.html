According to reports ACB is supposed to take prosecution sanction from Governor but it took it from Commissioner/Secretary DP&amp;AR. The court could not accept the prosecution sanction as it was not taken from where the law demands; as such is the situation Dr. C. Sangnghina&rsquo;s case regarding corruption was discharged by Special Court.</span></span></span></p>
