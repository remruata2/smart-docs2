****NOTES ON MEETING OF SECURITY CORDINATION COMMITTEE****

****(6th June 2025)****

**Introduction****:**

 Mizoram faces unique security challenges due to its geographical location. It is sandwiched between two foreign countries, Myanmar and Bangladesh, and shares borders with neighbouring states like Manipur, Assam, and Tripura, which have experienced instances of militancy. Consequently, heightened vigilance is necessary in all border areas.

Mizoram has a 510 km-long international border with Myanmar and a 318 km-long border with Bangladesh. The international border, although somewhat porous, is occasionally exploited by various insurgent groups for arms smuggling and the transit of militants.

**A. Issues related with Myanmar**:

1. **Myanmar Refugee**:

1. _Brief history_ –

 The Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and armed ethnic groups in Chin State, Myanmar, have been actively resisting the military regime that seized power on February 1, 2021. This prolonged conflict has resulted in a significant displacement of civilians, particularly from the Chin community, with many seeking refuge in Mizoram, India. Since the military coup, there have been eight major waves of Myanmar nationals fleeing to Mizoram. In an effort to address the political crisis, leaders of various ethnic groups held a workshop in Aizawl on September 7-8, 2023, with the objective of establishing an interim government in Chinland.

 In addition to the Chin community, escalating clashes between the Myanmar Army, under the State Administration Council (SAC), and the Arakan Army in Rakhine State have further exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. Following the Arakan Army's capture of most major cities in Rakhine State, members of the Khumi tribe have fled to southern Mizoram, reportedly escaping atrocities committed by the Arakan Army.

 On May 15, 2024, the Chin National Army (CNA), supported by various ethnic armed groups under the Chinland Council, launched a military offensive against the Myanmar Army and the Eastern Command camps of the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) in Tonzang Township. By May 19, 2024, the CNA and its allies had successfully captured several key camps, including Dampui Camp (ZRA), Nakzaang Camp (Myanmar Army), Chikha Camp (Myanmar Army), Eliza Camp, Suansang (ZRA), and Tonzang Town Camp (Myanmar Army). By December 2024, the Chin National Army (CNA) led Chin Land council had further expanded its control by capturing Myanmar Army camps in Mindat, Matupi, Kanpetlet, Hakha, and Thantlang towns.

 As of January 31, 2025, the Chinland Council has gained control over 95% of the areas in Chin State. However, the SAC (State Administration Council) still maintains a military presence in Hakha, Falam, Tedim, and Thantlang towns, despite being surrounded by the Chin National Army (CNA).

 Meanwhile, the Arakan Army remains in control of Paletwa town and several areas within the district. The Mara District is under shared control between the Maraland Defense Force (MDF), Chin Brotherhood, CDF Mara, and the Chinland Council.

_Key Areas of Control:_

- Chinland Council  : 95% of Chin State

- SAC : Hakha, Falam, Tedim, and Thantlang towns

- Arakan Army : Paletwa town and surrounding areas

- Shared Control : Mara District (MDF, Chin Brotherhood, CDF Mara, and Chinland Council)

 It's worth noting that tensions persist between the CNA and the Chin Brotherhood Alliance (CBA), with civil society organizations in Mizoram working to facilitate peaceful dialogue between the two groups.

 During these clashes, the Myanmar Army retaliated with airstrikes on Tonzang Town, Nakzaang, and Lungtak villages, causing civilians to flee these areas. Fearing further airstrikes, many of these displaced individuals sought refuge and safety in neighboring villages within Mizoram.

1. **The Free Movement Regime along the Indo-Myanmar Border :**

 Mizoram shares a 510-kilometer-long border with Myanmar, which remains unfenced and porous. Six districts in the state adjoin the international border, with Champhai district sharing the longest border with Myanmar.

1. _Brief history :_

 The Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that enables citizens of both countries to travel freely within a 16-kilometer radius of the border for up to 72 hrs without the need for a visa. This initiative aims to preserve traditional ties and alleviate insecurity for tribal communities residing along the border.

 The FMR spans 1,629.5 kilometers of unfenced border shared between four Indian states - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram - and Myanmar. In January 2018, the Union Cabinet approved a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance economic interactions through this regime.

 However, concerns have been raised regarding the regime's misuse. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, militants and criminals are exploiting the FMR to smuggle weapons, narcotics, and counterfeit currency, taking advantage of the regime's leniencies to cross borders and evade capture.

1. _Border Fencing and Free Movement Regime Abolition :_

 On February 28, 2024, the Mizoram Assembly unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Indian government’s proposal to build a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and to abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR). Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution expresses concerns that these measures would negatively impact the Zo ethnic communities, which have been historically divided by the border established during British colonial rule. The Assembly contends that strengthening this division with additional barriers would disturb the livelihoods and social connections of the border communities.

1. _FMR New Guidelines (Free Movement Limit On Indo-Myanmar Border Tightened to 10 Km, With Border Pass) :_

As per MHA Notification on dated December 24, 2024, the FMR range has been reduced from 16 kilometers to 10 kilometers on either side of the international border. The revised regulations, which came into effect on December 30, 2024, mandate the issuance of a Border Pass for residents within the 10-kilometer zone, permitting a stay of up to seven days.

1. Exemption under G.S.R. No. 1265:

  The Central Government, vide G.S.R. No. 1265, has exempted members of hill tribes, whether citizens of India or Myanmar, residing in the border areas under the Free Movement Regime, from the requirement of Rule 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950, subject to specified conditions.

2. Meeting chaired by Secretary (BM), MHA:

  On December 16, 2024, a meeting was convened under the chairmanship of the Secretary (Border Management), MHA, wherein State Governments were informed of the Government of India’s decision to regulate the FMR through the issuance of Border Passes. The Border Pass will be issued by the Assam Rifles based on the following criteria:

 -Proof of Identity (POI): A certificate issued by OC/SHO of Local Police Station (PS) or the local village chief/authority, confirming that the individual belongs to a village within 10 kilometers on either side of the international border.

 -Passport: The passport of the individual must indicate the address and name of the village falling within the 10-kilometer zone on either side of the international border.

1. **Surrendering of Myanmar Army**:

******Intensified military operations by armed ethnic groups in Myanmar's Chin State and Rakhine State have led to a significant number of Myanmar Army personnel surrendering to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles since late 2023.**

In November and December 2023, a total of 255 Myanmar Army personnel surrendered in the Champhai, Siaha, and Lawngtlai districts of Mizoram. This was followed by another 380 personnel surrendering in January 2024 within the Lawngtlai and Siaha districts. Initially, the Assam Rifles airlifted the surrendered personnel back to Myanmar using helicopters. Subsequently, they were evacuated by Myanmar military aircraft from Lengpui Airport. However, on January 23, 2024, a Myanmar aircraft scheduled to evacuate the remaining 92 personnel crash-landed at Lengpui Airport, resulting in injuries to six crew members on board.

Fortunately, there were no severe injuries or fatalities. The last group of surrendered personnel was eventually evacuated by two special Myanmar Air Force flights on January 24, 2024. As of February 11, 2025, a total of 635 Myanmar Army personnel had surrendered to the Mizoram Police and Indian security forces in Mizoram.

**B. Manipur IDPs**:

1. _Brief history :_

The violent unrest that broke out on May 3, 2023, in Churachandpur District, Manipur, was sparked by the "Tribal Solidarity March" organized by the All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM). The march was a protest against the proposed reservation for the majority Meitei community. Unfortunately, the unrest escalated into a year-long ethnic conflict between the tribal communities and the Meitei community, marked by armed clashes, destruction of property, and loss of life.

The prolonged conflict resulted in a significant influx of displaced persons seeking refuge in Mizoram, fleeing the violence and instability in their home state.

 The Meiteis residing in Mizoram are predominantly professionals, including university professors, central government employees, mechanics, and laborers. Notably, there have been no reported incidents of hostility or violence against them in the state.

**C. Issue related with Bangladesh :**

1. **Influx of Refugee :**

The Bangladesh Army launched a military operation against the Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) on November 15, 2022, in Chhaihkhiang Village, Bangladesh. This operation triggered a mass exodus of civilians, primarily from the Bawm community. During the initial wave, 272 civilians, including women and children, fled their villages and sought refuge in Mizoram, India.

Subsequent military operations led to three significant waves of Bawm civilians entering Mizoram's Lawngtlai District. However, the influx temporarily subsided during Bangladesh's election process in January 2024 and the peace talks between the KNA and the Bangladesh government.

The situation escalated again on April 2–3, 2024, when the KNA looted banks and seized arms, prompting intensified military operations. This resulted in further waves of Bawm refugees crossing into Mizoram.

On July 4, 2024, when 93 Bawm refugees entered Damdep-II Village in Lawngtlai District. Border Security Force (BSF) personnel attempted to deport them to Crocodile Camp, Kamtuli, but the Mizoram State Government intervened. On July 8, 2024, the 93 refugees, along with an additional 33 refugees, were safely transported to Chamdur Village.

1. **Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing**

The Indo-Bangladesh border, spanning approximately 4,096 kilometers, is one of the longest international boundaries globally. To enhance security and regulate migration, a comprehensive fencing project has been undertaken along this extensive border. Significant progress has been made, with over 90% of the fencing installation completed.

_Key Features of the Fencing Infrastructure :_

- _Primary Material :_ Barbed wire

- _Additional Features :_ Floodlights and advanced surveillance systems

- _Purpose :_ Effective border management and monitoring

High-priority areas prone to illegal crossings have been addressed, although some sections remain incomplete or require maintenance due to challenging terrain.

**D. Arecanut Smuggling in Mizoram :**

The smuggling of illicit arecanuts through Mizoram has been a persistent issue since 2016, primarily driven by attempts to evade the high taxes imposed on arecanut imports by the Government of India.

_Seizure Statistics :_

****

- Total Seizure (as of 31st May**2025**): 37,28,605 kilograms

- _Value:_ Rs. 64,47,83,880/-

**G. Mizoram-Assam Boundary Dispute :**

The Mizoram-Assam border, spanning 164.6 kilometers, has been a point of contention between the two states for decades. The dispute stems from differing interpretations of the border's demarcation, with Mizoram advocating for the 1875 Inner Line Reserve Forest boundary and Assam upholding the 1933 Survey of India map.

**Core Issue and Consequences**

The fundamental disagreement over the border's demarcation has led to a series of confrontations and skirmishes, perpetuating tensions between the two states. Recent incidents have intensified the conflict:

1. _February 27, 2018 :_ Mizoram Zirlai Pawl (MZP) constructed a rest house at Bairabi Zophai, which was demolished by Assam Police and Forest Officials, claiming it was within Assam's territory.

2. _June 30, 2021 :_ Tensions escalated when approximately 60 youths from Vairengte attempted to set up a camp at Aitlang, Vairengte for the Mizoram Police. Assam Police stopped them, leading to a standoff.

3. _July 26, 2021 :_ The situation further escalated when around 200 Assam Police officers led by Anurag Agarwal, IGP attempted to forcibly remove Mizoram Police personnel from their camp at Vairengte Auto Stand, resulting in violence and injuries on both sides.

**High-Level Meetings and Negotiations**

Several high-level meetings have been conducted to resolve the dispute:

1. Chief Secretary Level Meeting (July 27, 2021): Held in New Delhi, chaired by the Union Home Secretary.

2. Ministerial Level Border Talks (August 5, 2021): Conducted at Aijal Club in Mizoram.

3. Ministerial Level Meeting (August 9, 2022): Held at Aijal Club.

4. Ministerial Level Discussions (November 17, 2022): Took place in Guwahati, Assam.

5. Latest Ministerial Level Talks (August 9, 2024): Conducted at Mizoram's State Guest House.

6. Secretary Level Official Talks (24.04.2025) : Held in Guwahati Rohika AAU- International Guest House.

The Mizoram-Assam boundary dispute remains a complex issue, marked by historical grievances and sporadic violence. Sustained dialogue and negotiation are crucial for achieving a lasting resolution.

**H.** **Insurgency in Mizoram:**

1. **Hmar People's Convention (Democratic) and its Related Issues:**

 The Hmar People's Convention (Democratic) [HPC(D)] was established in 1996, with Lalhmingthanga Sanate from Khawlian, Mizoram, serving as its president. However, his 15-year leadership came to an end in September 2011 when he was impeached by the HPC(D) council for allegedly forming an alliance with the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) in Manipur. Consequently, H. Zosangbera took over as the new chairman of HPC(D), leading to a division within the organization into two factions: one led by H. Zosangbera and the other by Lalhmingthanga Sanate.

 Following negotiations with the Government of Mizoram, H. Zosangbera's faction publicly emerged during the Arms Surrender Ceremony at CTI, Sesawng on April 13, 2018. Meanwhile, Lalhmingthanga Sanate's faction remained inactive for a period but has recently resurfaced.

**Recent Activities of HPC (D)**

 Since late 2022, Lalhmingthanga Sanate of the HPC(D) has been issuing demand letters to various Village Councils within the HPC(D) demand areas, including Aizawl, Kolasib, and Saitual Districts. Additional demand letters were sent via WhatsApp in May and June 2023, threatening Village Council leaders with consequences if they failed to comply.

 On December 24, 2022, Lalhmingthanga Sanate was apprehended by the Assam Rifles and Assam Police in Cachar, Assam, and was found in possession of a .32 pistol and 48 live rounds of ammunition. He was released on bail from judicial custody on May 15, 2023.

 As long as Lalhmingthanga Sanate's armed group remains active across Mizoram, Manipur, and Assam, they are likely to gain strength by recruiting more volunteers. Moreover, some surrendered members from H. Zosangbera's faction might join them.

 Mizoram has been experiencing low-level insurgencies in its northeastern and northwestern regions. However, on April 2, 2018, the Government of Mizoram and the HPC(D) signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS), marking the end of over two decades of armed insurgency by the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony took place on April 12, 2018, with approximately 102 cadres and 12 council members of the HPC(D) surrendering. Nevertheless, the other faction of the HPC(D), led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate, has begun reorganizing and resurfacing, engaging in donation collection and fund extortion throughout 2022 and 2023.

**Cases registered against HPCD, Lalhmingthanga Sanate Faction (during 2022 to 2024) :**

1. No. of case registered –  31
2. No. of persons arrested  –  09
3. No. of Case disposed – 12
4. Pending Investigation – 19

1. **Emergence of Tripura Ham Bagra TA Army (THBTA)**

A new Bru insurgent group, Tripura Ham Bagra TA Army (THBTA), has emerged in Tripura, comprising around 50 members, including 20 Bru refugees from Mizoram. The group is led by Phillip Ryoung, a former auto-rickshaw driver from Bandarima Village, North Tripura District, Tripura.

**Background of THBTA Formation**

The Bru issues in Mizoram are deeply rooted in the demand for autonomy in Mizoram, which led to violence in 1997. The Bru National Union (BNU) sought the creation of an Autonomous District Council for Brus in western Mizoram, but faced strong opposition from the Mizo community. This led to the formation of the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) in 1996, which engaged in various activities, including robbery and extortion.

- The Government of Mizoram initiated peace talks, and BNLF members surrendered on July 25, 2005. Another Bru insurgent group, the Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM), surrendered on October 26, 2006.

- A tripartite accord was signed on August 10, 2019, between the Government of India, the Government of Tripura, and the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) to end the insurgency.

- The remaining faction of NLFT, along with the All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF), signed a peace accord with the Government of India and the Government of Tripura on September 4, 2024, ending the 35-year-old insurgency in Tripura.

- On 2025, Phillip Ryoung started a new Bru Insurgent groups called Tripura Ham Bagra TA Army consisting of around 50 members.

**THBTA's Objectives and Activities**

- _Main Objective :_ THBTA aims to carve out North Tripura District from Tripura and form a Bru state.

- _Cadre Strength :_ THBTA has an estimated 50 personnel, including 20 Brus from Mizoram.

- _Firearms :_ THBTA possesses at least two firearms, with reports suggesting an increase in their arsenal.

- _Camps :_ THBTA has camps at Old Zopui and New Zopui under Baghaichhari PS, Rangamati District, Bangladesh.

- _Extortion :_ THBTA has made financial demands among contractors in Tripura and has started engaging in extortion among the Brus in Tripura.

**Potential Threats to Mizoram**

- _Recruitment :_ THBTA may conduct recruitment among Brus in Mizoram, potentially disrupting the peaceful condition of the state.

- _Extortion :_ THBTA's extortion activities may extend to Mizo villages in Jampui Hills, North Tripura District, Tripura, leading to communal issues between the Mizos and Brus.

- _Kidnapping :_ THBTA may resort to kidnapping and extortion at the tri-border areas of Mizoram, Tripura, and Bangladesh to finance their activities.
