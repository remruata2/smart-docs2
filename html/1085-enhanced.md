******II. PROTEST AGAINST ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES IN THE RECRUITMENT OF 13 POSTS OF LOWER DIVISIONAL CLERK (LDC)**

On 8.7.2013 around 700-800 students from different colleges of Aizawl City under the aegis of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) assembled near the main gate of Mizoram University (MZU) from around 8:30 AM in protest against alleged irregularities in the recruitment of 13 posts of Lower Divisional Clerk (LDC) and demanded an immediate rectification and cancellation of the said recruitment. The agitating students carried placards/banners and chanted a slogan against Vice Chancellor, Mizoram University. The Police Force placed a barricade near the main gate of Mizoram University and the Police used teargas and lathi to prevent agitating students from marching to the main gate of Mizoram University. During a brief scuffle between agitating students and Police, two students sustained minor injuries. They are Michael Zonuntluanga S/o Zothanzauva, Khatla South and Vanlalrempuia S/o M.S. Dawngliana, Nursery Veng. The negotiation between Vice Chancellor and leaders of MZP failed to reach an immediate solution.

The Vice Chancellor, Mizoram University attended the office under the protection of Police. However, Mizoram University has cancelled the ongoing examination slated to be conducted today after the agitation.

The agitating students dispersed peacefully at 4:30 PM and the joint meeting between leaders of student bodies under the aegis of Mizo Zirlai Pawl will be held in the evening, i.e. 8.7.2013 to discuss further course of action.

The genesis of today’s agitation with regard to recruitment of 13 posts of Lower Divisional Clerk (LDC) by Mizoram University is as under:

532 applicants/candidates applied for 13 posts of Lower Divisional Clerk (LDC) at Mizoram University. The papers consists of :-

(i) Quantitative Aptitude - 50 marks

(ii) General Knowledge - 100 marks

(iii) General English - 50 marks

(iv) Computer Proficiency test - 50 marks

(v) Interview - 60 marks

On 11th May 2013, a written examination was conducted and Computer test was conducted on 4th June, 2013. The interview for 46 applicants /candidates who qualified/passed the written and Computers tests was held on 12th June, 2013.

When the final result was announced, 13 persons were declared qualified for the posts and 3 persons were placed on the panel list. The final result came as a surprise to the MZP as they alleged that final result was not based on merit and those who scored higher marks in written exam were not selected and accused the MZU of practicing nepotism in the recruitment process.
