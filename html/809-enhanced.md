No.11-A-02815, 4(four) Magazines and 120 rounds of ammunitions. Hence Thingsai P.S Case No.5/08 dt.13.5.2008 u/s 6(a)PP(EII)Rules r/w 25(1B)(a) Arms Act had been registered and the accused was sent to Lunglei Court.

The accused appealed the Court's judgement on 7.7.2008 and the Court disposed of the case on 17.7.2008.**

**2. On 31.5.2010 one Section of 96 Bn. BSF rounded up 15(fifteen) persons mostly traders at Vaseikai village and were taken to their camp for interrogation. Out of 15(fifteen) persons, only one was detained who was later on identified as Mong Mong Kyi. After interrogation and based on his own statement of his being a Myanmar army deserter, FIR was submitted to the Vasei P.S the same day. On 1.6.2010 he was taken to Lawngtlai P.S and General Diary Entry was made vide GDE.No.10 dt. 1.6.2010 at 3:55 pm. Thorough interrogation was conducted by engaging interpreter Patrick Savung of Lawngtlai-IV. The interrogation and investigation conducted by Lawngtlai P.S could not establish his being one of the Myanmar Army deserters as alleged by the BSF. No incriminating documents or arms were seized from him except few Indian currency notes, few articles like toothbrush and toothpaste etc.**

**On 5.6.2010 one Mohan Mog who was engaged as interpreter by the BSF at the time of their interrogation was summoned to Lawngtlai P.S for interrogation. He was also thoroughly interrogated who deposed before the Police that as the accused had been subjected to physical torture he advised him to co-operate and say 'Yes' to all the questions asked by the interrogator so as to avoid further application of third degree method upon him.**

**It may also be mentioned that the arrested accused could not speak Myanmarese language accordingly to Mohan Mog and Patrick Savung of Lawngtlai. The accused stated that he entered into Mizoram in search of manual work to earn his living.**

**Since all the efforts to link him up as one of the Myanmar army deserters as alleged by the BSF proved futile, he was booked under Lawngtlai P.S C/No. 62/10 dt. 3.6.2010 u/s 6(1)(a) IPP Rules on the basis of FIR lodged by ASI Devaraj Chakma of Lawngtlai P.S and was sent to Court. On 7.6.2010 on getting the written Court order, Mong Mong Kyi was pushed back to Myanmar under proper Police escort through Tuidangchhuah/Hruitezawl.**
