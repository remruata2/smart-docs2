The clashes between the Myanmar Army and the civil volunteer which started since the military coup in 01.02.2021 continued till date. Latest report indicated that armed conflict between the Myanmar Army and the People’s Defence Force (PDF) had taken place at Kalaymeo Township as late as 2nd March, 2024 claiming many lives both from the Army and the PDF. The recently formed Chinland Government in 01.02.2024 had a meeting at Camp Victoria, its Headquarters on 07.03.2024 wherein the 15 (fifteen) Council of Ministers and the Chief Minister of the Chinland Government as well as leaders of NGOs were present. The meeting decided to invite some of the ethnic groups of Chin state who has not yet join the Chinland Government and also discussed ways of raising funds for the newly formed government. However, some of the councils and committees representing Chin State are expressing their disapproval of the Chinland Government. The hostility between the ethnic armed groups is reportedly increased after the formation of the Chinland Government.

Arakan Army has been attacking the Myanmar Army camps located in and around Paletwa Township since the last part of 2023. As per latest inputs, 22 Myanmar Army camp inside Rakhine State, Myanmar has been captured by the Arakan Army and the flag of Arakan Army had been hoisted at Paletwa Township to mark their dominance of the area. Inputs indicated that Arakan Army has no intention of disrupting the KMMTTP within their operational area. On the contrary, the spokesperson of Arakan Army/United League of Arakan (ULA) had recently stated that Arakan Army will not interfere on the ongoing project of KMMTTP and expected a good relation with the Indian Government. However, it is reported that the Khumi National Defence Army (KNDA) did not appreciate the hoisting of Arakan Army flag at Paletwa Township. The Khumis had been claiming the areas of Paletwa Township as their ancestral home and latest inputs suggested that the Khumis from different part of the country are being recruited to join the Khumi National Defence Army (KNDA) to overthrow the Arakan Army from Paletwa Township.

DRUGS AND ILLEGAL TRADE :

 Mizoram shares an unfenced porous international border with Myanmar which is often taken advantage by drug smugglers and illegal traders. Due to the long stretch border and porosity in the absence of physical barrier combined with Free Movement Regime, people across the border can move freely cross the border at many locations resulting in an easy route for smugglers. The increase in the illegal trafficking of narcotic drugs in the recent time can be attributed due to the ethnic clash in Manipur which did not allows trafficking these contraband items through the state and increasing demand of fund by many ethnic armed groups of Myanmar who are fighting the State Administrative Council to overthrow the Myanmar Army from the current political administration.
