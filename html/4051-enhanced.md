Due to the recent intense military operations conducted by the combined resistance forces of Myanmar against Myanmar Army in several places of Chin State, Myanmar, many Myanmar Army and Police personnel posted and camped near the IMB surrendered themselves to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles at different places. These personnel of Myanmar were evacuated to safety for their return into Myanmar. The lack of proper Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on the issue of surrendering of Myanmar Army personnel or government servant needed a review to devise a strategy on the matter.

 The issue of foreign National Army entering our state/country with arms and ammunitions in large numbers is a threat to the internal security of the state as well as the country. The entry of such unauthorised entry of armed foreign Army personnel post a high risk to the population especially the residents along the indo (Mizoram) Myanmar border areas.

Uniform personnel of Myanmar who surrendered to Mizoram Police/Assam Rifles are as under :
