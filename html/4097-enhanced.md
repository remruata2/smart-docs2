A. BRU NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (BNLF):

**Introduction :**

 The BNLF was formed on 9.11.1996 at Tuirum to strengthen the repeated demands of Autonomous District Council for Bru people living in western belt of Mizoram by Bru National Union.

1. _Activities :_

 A Conference convened by BNU was held at Saipuilui Village of Mamit District on 23-24 Sept 1997 and the Conference passed a resolution demanding separate Autonomous District Council for Brus in Western Belt of Mizoram. Mizos living in this belt reacted immediately against the said resolution as a result of which the situation in this area had become tense between the two communities.

 To make matter worst, Pu Lalzawmliana, Wild Life Game Watcher of Forest Department was killed by some unknown miscreants and his two companion viz. Jutendro and (2) Ngaihdama had also been abducted on 21.10.1997. The two abducted persons resurfaced at Dampa Sanctuary on 24.10.1997 and revealed that the deceased was murdered by 10 armed Bru militant group.

 The general public of Bru Community were also threatened by Bru militants to leave Mizoram and to escape the wrath of Police and Mizos due to the murder of the Forest Game Watcher. As a result, a large number of Bru people fled Mizoram in the last part of 1997 and they settled at Tripura North District as refugees.

Numerous activities like robbing, assault of innocent civilians and endless demand letter for money have been served to the people of Mizos living in the western belt of Mizoram by the BNLF.

**B. BRU LIBERATION FRONT OF MIZORAM (BLFM)**

**The Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM) was formed in December, 2001 at Naisingpara refugee camp,Tripura, reportedly at the instance of NLFT (BM) under the leadership of Vanlalliana founder president of BNLF but overthrown by his own men.**

 At the initial stage of forming the BLFM, the first ever major activities launched by BLFM was kidnapping of one Maxi Cab driver Lalfamkima on 1.4.2003 demanding huge amount of ransom money. This was followed by a series of activities like serving of demand letters to Mizoram villages bordering to Tripura.

With the signing of Memorandum of Understanding between BNLF (a premier Bru Insurgent Outfit) and GOM, the BLFM cadres were also expected to come overground and join the mainstream to enjoy rehabilitation and other facilities at per with BNLF. However, this hope was shattered by the BLFM themselves by committing kidnapping of two employees of Teirei Mini Hydel Project from the dam site on 8.8.2005.

The BLFM further intensified their activities inside Mizoram villages by forcible collection of donations from innocent civilians of Mizoram resulting into Counter Operation by Mizoram Police. There have been four armed encounter since then wherein three BLFM cadres sustained bullet injuries. On 11.1.2006, the BLFM on their way back to their camp open deliberate firing towards the MAP post of New Kawnpui located at Tripura - Mizoram border.

 With the initiative of 36 AR, Kanchanpur, 38 nos of BLFM cadres including Vice President, General Secretary and other senior officers with 14 nos. of different types of arms surrendered to Govt. of Mizoram. This was followed by reshuffling a Cabinet of BLFM members on 20.4.2006 as under :-

 Secy. i/c Finance - Lalthazuala @ Yakcho

 Secy. i/c Home - Lalhmingthanga @ Tumbroila

 Secy. i/c Comm. - Indiarai @ Zonunthara

 Dy. COAS - Rothangliana

_Surrendering of BLFM Splinter Group :_

 The BLFM is a very ill-organised militant group from the very outset. A splinter group of BLFM headed by A. Zoramthanga, former Vice President and Lalrinkima, Gen. Secretary numbering 38 surrendered to the Govt. with weapons on 16.3.2006 followed by 4 cadres on 6.7.2006 and 11 cadres on 17.8.2006. Altogether 53 cadres of A. Zoramthanga faction of BLFM surrendered before Govt. of Mizoram by the turn of September, 2006.

_Rehabilitation and resettlement :_

 Govt. of Mizoram rehabilitated this group with Cash Assistance and Housing Assistance at par with the BNLF surrenderees. They were resettled at Pangbalkawn village by purchasing a plot of land for them. However, most of them have returned to refugee camps in Tripura except 6 of them who resettled at Chhimluang, Saihapui and Pangpalkawn itself.

_Arrest of President, etc._

In the aftermath of the surrender of 38 BLFM cadres, four BLFM top brass leaders viz. (1) Vanlalliana, President, (2) Vanrama, Vice President (3) Romawia Meska, COAS and (4) Lallawma, SS Capt. were arrested on 20.4.2006 in a joint operation of Mizoram Police SB and Assam Rifles of Kanchanpur code name Operation Black Hound which was another major blow to the BLFM.

_Surrender of 804 strong cadres of BLFM :_

 Out of frustration due to arrest of their top leaders and surrender of 53 cadres of BLFM, the remaining 804 strong members of BLFM decided to lay down their arms and surrender to the Govt. unconditionally. As such, the remaining BLFM cadres, with the active participation of Assam Rifles laid down their arms on 26.10.2006 and were temporarily sheltered in two Transit Camps viz. Damparengpui and Tuipuibari. Free ration have been provided as per scale which was sanctioned by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India. However, the state Govt. has also supplement the sanction as the surrenderees have to stay in the transit camp over and above the anticipated period.

_Identification of BLFM surrenderees :_

****Although the Govt. accepted the BLFM cadres as militant surrenderees, identification of bonafide Mizoram Bru was felt necessary for their further resettlement in Mizoram. Govt. officials and NGOs have been sent to their respective Transit Camp and out of 804 BLFM cadres, 731 were identified as genuine Mizoram Brus. Finding of the identification team District wise is as under :-

| **Sl.No.** | **Name of District** | **Nos. of BLFM** | **Doubtful** | **Identified** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Mamit | 590 | 35 | 555 |
| 2. | Kolasib | 129 | 11 | 118 |
| 3. | Lunglei | 57 | - | 57 |
| 4. | Lawngtlai | 1 | - | 1 |
| 5. | Outsider | 27 | 27 | - |
| **Total =** |  | **804** | **73** | **731** |


Resettlement**:**  The Govt. of Mizoram took all possible steps to resettle the BLFM surrenderees identified as a bonafide resident of Mizoram with their family members at the places selected by concerned District Authorities. Housing Assistance to the tune Rs. 30,000/- each was disbursed to them in two installments. However, the BLFM surrenderees were reluctant to be resettled provided they were given viz. –
1. Rs. 50,000/- each as Rehabilitation Package.
2. Unconditional release of their jailed leaders.
3. Resettlement in one or two places only in Mamit District.
4. Withdrawal of pending cases against BLFM members in other states.
5. Hike of transportation cost from Rs.2,000/- to Rs. 3,000/- and

 Construction of temporary hut from Rs.3,000/- to Rs. 5000/-

1. One year free ration after resettlement.
2. Five bundles of GCI sheets.
3. Immediate solution of Bru issues.
4. Immediate implementation of the Development Project as was agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding between the BNLF and Govt. of Mizoram.

In spite of the above demands made by the BLFM surrenderees the Govt. of Mizoram has been taking various steps for the permanent settlement of the BLFM surrenderees which could not be materialized due to the absence of active co-operation of the leader of BLFM in respect of proposals for their resettlement.

 The meeting held in the office chamber of Chief Secretary of Mizoram on 29.8.08 reiterated the need for actional plan for settlement of BLFM surrenderees and District concerned administration are instructed to go ahead with the allocation of house site at the places earmarked for their resettlement.

Food and Civil Supplies Department were also required to issued ration cards to the BLFM surrenderees based on the list submitted by Police Department.

The BLFM surrenderees in the transit camp were issued Job card under NREGS Scheme as far as practicable whereas some of them are under process

**C. UNITED DEMOCRATIC LIBERATION ARMY (UDLA)/ BRU REVOLUTIONARY ARMY OF UNION (BRAU)**

****The armed Bru militant outfit UDLA was formed in the year 2005 by Doinoram Reang of Gutkuti without any definite aims and objectives and are considered to be the remnants of previous Bru militant outfits (BNLF and BLFM). They are not a well organized group like other insurgent groups of the North East India and are more likely to be an armed gang. They used to collect the so-called donations in their operational areas, which is the Assam-Mizoram-Tripura border areas, at the rate of Rs.100/- from Bru families and Rs.300/- from non-Bru families annually.

 Later, another Bru armed gang who call themselves as Bru Revolutionary Army of Union (BRAU) was also formed under the leadership of Rajesh Chorkhy. These organizations were formed separately with the objective of creation of separate homeland for tribals living in the Assam- Mizoram border areas. After these groups had undertaken and indulged in various criminal and subversive activities to achieve their objectives, they laid down their arms before Assam police in the year 2019. A home coming ceremony was later held at Katlicherra, Assam for the 1100 cadres of UDLA/BRAU. As per the agreement, Assam Government promised a rehabilitation package of â‚¹ 4,00,000 each for the self appointed officers/cabinet members of UDLA/BRAU with another â‚¹ 1,500,00 for each of the cadres.

 Although an agreement was reached between them and the Assam Government, some disgruntled cadres again formed the United Tribal Liberation Front of Barak Valley (UTLFB) in mid May 2022 with Jiten Reang (former Vice President of BRAU) as its President. At present, this group, which is more like some sort of bandits, are scattered within RifleMara. Gutguti and Santipur of Hailakandhi, Assam. Some leaders of UTLFB often visited Damdia and Kolalian villages of Mizoram. However, there has been no reports of any subversive activities by them inside Mizoram till date.

 Presently, there has been no reports of any intention of the formation of a new Bru militant outfit whether it is in Mizoram or Tripura state.
