Subject :  Submission of enquiry report

Sir,

I am to state that the enquiry into the suspicious transaction/money mule account transaction in the SBI bank account of Vanlalhriati d/o C. Vanlalmaka of Chawnpui, Aizawl account No. 30339919286 of SBI Main Branch has been conducted and am hereby submitting my enquiry report.

**BRIEF OF CASE:**

The enquiry resulted with the report that Shri Diwakal Tiwari received an e-mail from Bavister Picolo Colvis, reportedly senior advocate of Nigeria, Paul &amp; Co, Legal Solicitors &amp; Advocates Head Office No. 34 Parliament Street, Western Avenue, Nigeria, YOI B&amp;G, NGRC 47034 asking him to deposit Rs. 49 thousand (Equivalent of GBP 600) as fees for preparing affidavit in connection with a foreign lottery which he has won. Checking revealed that the account has several intercity cash deposits and withdrawals through ATM which led to the allegation that the account of Ms. Vanlalhriati has been used as money mule account.

**STEP TAKEN:**

The account holder Ms. Vanlalhriati was examined. The account has been kept frozen and the bank account statement has also been taken which is submitted with this report.

**ASSESSMENT OF THE CASE:**

 From the statement of Ms. Vanlalhriati and subsequent enquiry the following are ascertained.

 That Ms. Vanlalhriati opened a saving account at SBI Main Branch, Solomons Cave, Aizawl. Account No. 30339919288 on 3.3.2008 which she brought to Mumbai where she found worked at a health spa. Then she was befriended through her friend by one Nigerian called Kido who, according to her, later became her boyfriend. She gave her account and ATM Card to Kido on his request which she said was to help him in his business, exact business she did not know, for easy transfer of money as he, as a, foreigner could not open an account. There was Rs. 500/- in the account at time when she handed over her account to him. On May, 2008 Kido then operated the account till end of August, 2009. She then took back her account when she heard that the account had been used by Kido on other suspicious dealings.

 Checking of the account shows the transaction as under:

| **SI No.** | **Time** | **Total Debit** **(in Rs.)** | **Total Credit** **(in Rs.)** | **Balance** **(in Rs.)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1/3/08 – 30/9/08 | 15,92,431 | 15,93,372 | 941 |
| 2 | 1/10/08 – 31/3/08 | 26,72,068 | 26,71,773 | 646 |
| 3 | 1/4/08 – 5/10/08 | 10,90,847 | 10,90,228 | 27 |
| **Total** | **1/3/08 – 5/10/08** | **53,55,346** | **53,55,373** | 27 |


 Comparing the statement of the subject and the bank account statement, it appears that the statement of the subject is consistent as the transaction commenced after she handed over the account bank and ATM Card. The account was cleared out leaving balance of Rs. 27/- just about the time before she mentioned as the time when she took back the account and ATM Card. All the transaction appeared to be done by this Kido, full name not known by subject. His telephone number is 09867209258 which he still uses, and rented an apartment at Landmark Building, 2nd Floor, Sector 19, Khengar Navi, Mumbai which he appears to have vacated. The subject is also presently in Mumbai using mobile No. 09619434121 but could not locate Kido.

**FINDINGS:**

The finding of the enquiry is that the SBI Account No. 30339919288 in the name of Ms. C. Vanlalhriati has been used as money mule account and cheating, but, the subject Ms. C. Vanlalhriai was not involved in the operation

Enclosed :  1) Statement of Ms. C. Vanlalhriati
