As a result, again several Bru villages were burnt down and looted by majority Mizo people inside Mizoram. Thousands of Bru have been displaced from Mizoram and now staying at relief camps in North Tripura. And these people and their problems have been brushed aside even though the matter has been placed before the concern authority. The people of this second exodus must be treated with the same to the old migrants.
