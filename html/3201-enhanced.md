**Students’ procession**: Students of J.Thankima College will organise a procession starting from their college at 10:00AM this morning, the college received more than 70 lakh from Central government for the construction of college building, but there was opposition from two people regarding the plot of land which government has given for the college building. If the sanctioned money is not used now it will lapse, this made the students desperate. Block I is ready to be built but as the government cannot give land lease, construction of building could not be started. They will organize procession not to spite the government but to ask for its help to sort out the problem.
