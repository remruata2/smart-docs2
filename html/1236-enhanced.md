****Points relating to agenda proposed to be discussed during Directional Level co-ordination meeting of LIA (Lead Intelligence Agency) with reference to No. G/OPS-I/LIA/M&C-Ftr/2013/2878-2913 Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, HQ Inspector General, M&C Frontier, BSF (GENERAL BRANCH)****

****i)** **Security scenario in Barak Valley (Assam) and Mizoram, particularly areas bordering with Bangladesh**: The security scenario of the western part of Mizoram bordering with Bangladesh is comparatively peaceful. However, due to the occasional incident of kidnappings/abduction occurred in the border areas because of the porousness of the Indo-Bangladesh border required more attention. The border between Mizoram and Bangladesh, especially Mamit District side of Mizoram and Bangladesh, deserves special attention in and around Dampa Wildlife Sanctuary Abduction cases have had occured in which 5 (five) persons have been abducted by NLFT on the month of Feb.2013. Subsequently, 3(persons) have been abducted by the combined team of NLFT and BDFM in the later part of the same year, out of which 2 persons have been released on 20.01.2014 and the abductors still keep one of the abductees Deep Mandal, Airtel Surveyor in their captivity. However, the Mizoram Government is continuing its efforts to secure his safe and early release. In this regard, an outpost of IR Bn. had been established at Chikha in Dampa Tiger Reserve area, Mamit District. The security condition of the said areas is being kept under constant watch.**

**iv) Trans-border crimes and illegal movement through border**:

 (a) On 6.6.2011, two employees of ABCI had been abducted by Assam based militant group named UDLA from ABCI camp near Meidum village, Kolasib district. The gang with the abductees left the camp by using the company's vehicle. Hence, Bairabi PS C/No.7/11 dt.6.6.11 u/s 365/386/395/34 IPC r/w 25(1B) (b) Arms Act had been registered.

 The hostages were rescued on 16.6.2011 after a firefight between Joint Operation Team of CID (SB) and 1st IR Bn. RAF of Mizoram Police and the Armed gang at the outskirt of Banglabasha village of Hailakandi district of Assam. After an encounter which lasted for about 30 minutes, the so-called UDLA fled towards the jungle leaving the two hostages behind. The commander of the group, before fleeing, shot at the right abdomen of one of the hostages, namely Premlal Dhiman, Project Manager, ABCI causing serious injury and the abductees were rescued safely. Neither the Police nor the armed group sustained any injury as a result of the encounter. On 26.10.2012, two of the accused persons suspected to be involved in the said abduction case namely, S/S President Doinaram Reang and S/S Pte. Zohmangaiha were arrested who admitted their involvement during interrogation.

The incident took place at a small ABCI designated camp called Lamba Sora located in between New Sachan and Mauzam, Lunglei district and the place of occurrence was not far away from Indo-Bangladesh border. The abductors took the hostages to the nearby Tarunpara village, Rangamati district, Bangladesh. The motive behind the abduction as claimed by NLFT was irregular payment of the so-called taxes imposed to be paid by the company to the outfit. The abductors plainly asserted that any attempt to launch rescue operation would invite instant killing of all hostages without hesitation.

The hostages were released on 30.4.2012 after 35 days long captivity inside Bangladesh. The hostages after their release reached BSF camp at Rajivnagar (Tuipuibari-II), Mamit district. Hence, Tlabung PS C/No.3/12 Dt. 30.3.2012 u/s 363/395 IPC r/w 25(1B) (a) Arms Act had been registered.

The abductors took away teak royalty documents/permits along with cash amounting Rs.30, 000/- and left towards Bangladesh border through the jungle. The abductors demanded payment of ransom money of Rs.15 lakhs each for the release of the hostages. Accordingly, W.Phaileng PS C/No.36/12 dt.26.11.12 u/s 364(A)/171/34 IPC r/w 25(1A) Arms Act had been registered. Further, information received stated that the three abductees Bengali Teak (timber) traders abducted by the combined group of NLFT and BNCT on 25.11.2012 from Tuipuibari-II were held at NLFT camp known as “Hnahbok Camp” located inside Kasalong forest west of Zopui village in Sazek hills of Bangladesh. It is learnt that families of the abductees were last contacted on 02.12.2012 through mobile phone by the abductors urging them to immediately pay up their ransom demand of Rs 30 lakhs. However, the abductees were released on 12.12.2012 after their families reportedly had paid Rs. 9 lakhs of ransom money to the kidnappers.
