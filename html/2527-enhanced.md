Enquiry Report

 On 15.3.2021 Village Council-I of Vairengte allotted lands to members belonging to their jurisdiction who are without a land of their own and whom they believed will certainly erect a house of their own near Auto stand, Vairengte in and around the disputed Mizoram- Assam border areas.

 Initially, there were 73 persons in all to whom these lands were allotted. However, after around three weeks, with the pretex of having financial shortage for building a house, 9 persons surrendered back the land allotted to them which resulted in 64 persons having lands in these areas at present.

 These allotted lands are divided at an interval of around 30 feet from each other and are selected by their intended owner at random using lucky -draw.

 By 8th May 2021,18 houses have been under construction, the type and progress of which, however, varied from house to house. Some of the structure of these houses have been constructed using reinforced cement concrete. A new link road, which is around 1.5 Kms in length has also been built as a result of the undertaking of Vairengte VC-I on the western side of this area which goes northwards towards the pond near Vairengte High School.

 The flat top of this hillock above the Auto Stand has been reserved for accommodating Mizoram Police Personnel. At the same time, it has been learnt that Vairengte VC-I has been taking steps to further allot lands near Assam Teak Forest which lies beyond this Auto Stand in the near future. Presently, this area is manned by elements of 1IR Bn. with 3 personnel in each shift and no reports of any objection from Assam Police or Forest Department have been received so far as a result of these house constructions.
