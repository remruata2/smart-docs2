Ref: No. MSB/CB/B-19(A)/233 Dt: 3.4.2019

 With reference to your letter cited above, I am submitting threat perception report regarding potential threat to the Jewish community in Mizoram.

My findings are as under:

**1. It is understood that the Jewish community in Mizoram in the name of Shevet Meneshe are affiliated to a Jerusalem based organization called **Shavei Israel Hebrew Center**, having their Headquarters at Upper Republic, Aizawl Mizoram. The Jewish community in Mizoram are believed to be numbering around 1,500 members, scattered in small numbers throughout the state particularly in areas like Kolasib, Vairengte, Bairabi ,. Rengdil and Sialhawk ( Champhai District).**

2. The Jews in Mizoram are understood to be having Synagogues in two locations within Aizawl, namely in Bazar Bungkawn, Dawrpui areas and Marcy Villa, Upper Republic numbering around 450 members while others Synagogue are also believed to be located in Kolasib, Vairengte, Bairabi and Sialhawk.

3. Enquiry was made among the Jewish community and to their Synagogues Leaders (Khazan) who believe to have no potential threat till today. They never received any threat informations or precautions regarding Jihadist propaganda from their General Headquarter, Jerusalem.

4. The main aim of Jews in Mizoram is immigration to Israel and waits for the arrival of the Messiah as they do not believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior. The Mizo community merely recognizes the Jewish community as they are small in number and few activities in the society.

 In light of the above enquiry, no potential threat is perceived against the Jewish community in Mizoram either direct or indirect at present in connection with Jihadish propaganda.
