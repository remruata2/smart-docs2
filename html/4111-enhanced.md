**_PROPOSED AGENDA FOR 5TH STATE LEVEL STANDING COMMITTEE_ _TO MONITOR BORDER SECURITY MEETING_**

**I. Review on Indo-Bangladesh Border Situation :**

(a) _Kuki-Chin National Front and its activities:_ After a series of online meeting, "Third round Peace Talk" between Kuki-Chin National Front/Army (KCNA) and Government of Bangladesh (GoB) represented by the Peace Committee was held on 5th November, 2023 at Hmunlai village, near Ruma bazar, Bandarban district, Bangladesh. Although no definite agreements were made, the meeting, agreed to maintained cease-fire between both the parties until the next peace talk. The understanding between Bangladesh Government/Army and KCNA could be temporary as it could be a short term strategy of Bangladesh Government for conducting a peaceful General Election which however was concluded on 07.01.2024. As such, all border guarding agencies may be informed to be vigilant in their respective areas as fighting between the two parties can resume at any moment.

**(b) _Unauthorised villages :_ The issue of unauthorised villages in the border areas which could serve as a harbouring places for illegal immigrants needed immediate attention. A meeting on the issue of unauthorised Villages within Tlabung Sub-Division was convened by Pu Dony Lalruatsanga, Addl. DC, Lunglei at Lunglei Deputy Commissioner Conference Room on 13.06.2023 and was attended by 4 (four) Office Bearers of Khawthlangtuipui Group YMA The meeting decided that sites verification of the alleged unauthorised villages be conducted by the government with a report submitted to the District Level Committee before 15.07.2023. Subsequent to the decision, the meeting of Khawthlangtuipui Group YMA and SDO (C) Tlabung on 14.07.2023 placed the following villages which are under Tlabung Sub-division as unauthorised villages:**

 1) Bornasury Village ,which is just near to Chawilung Village and is  at the boundary of Lunglei District and Chakma Autonomous  District Council (CADC).

 2) Chandobighat village and Letisury Village

 3) Hmundo and Nakuksora Villages near Bandiasora Village.

 4) Dursury Village near Malsuri Village.

 5) Gurusora Village near New Balakiasuri Village.

 6) A joint meeting of Khawthlangtuipui Group YMA and the leaders  of Zohmun Village on 15.07.2023 also decided to give Zohmun  Village under Zodin Village Council an authorized village status.

**(c) _Transit camps of PCJSS (Shanti Bahini):_ Peace Accord MNF Returnee Association (PAMRA), General Headquarters, Aizawl in its Press Release issued on 24.01.2024 alleged that an underground organisation operating in Chittagong Hill Tract, Bangladesh called Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhiti Samiti (PCJSS) also known as JSS (Santu Group) had military training camps inside Lunglei and Mamit District of Mizoram and expressed its concerned for the security of the state of Mizoram as well as civil society.**

 In this regard, it is learnt that the Press Release issued by PAMRA had factual discrepancies regarding information about the so called underground organisation, Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhiti Samiti (PCJSS) and the names of the villages alleged to host military training camps for PCJSS. Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhiti Samiti (PCJSS) is a political front having an armed wing called Santi Bahini in the past. In 1997, an accord was signed between the Bangladesh Government and PCJSS and the armed militia Santi Bahini was disarmed while PCJSS became a political party. However, dissatisfied with the non implementation of the agreement between PCJSS and the Bangladesh Government, some members of PCJSS started fighting with the Bangladesh Government since 2008 which often involved arms conflicts. The alias of PCJSS mentioned in the Press Release, JSS (Santu Group) is not an official organisation but merely the same political organisation PCJSS who is currently headed by Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma alias Santu. Mizoram Police had in the past visited these transit camps of PCJSS and verified that these so called military training camps had been mostly dismantled.

 Following up on this allegation, SP Lunglei and SP Mamit also independently conducted spot visits verification of the alleged training camps and the copies of their reports are enclosed herewith.

**II. Review on Indo-Myanmar Border Situation :**

 Inputs received indicated that the various armed factions of Civil Disobedient Movement(CDM) in Myanmar are still fighting the Myanmar Army (MA) and had captured several Myanmar Army camps, including along the Indo (Mizoram) Myanmar Border areas during the last 3-4 months.

 (a) Due to the recent intense military operations conducted by the combined resistance forces of Myanmar against Myanmar Army in several places of Chin State and Rakhine state, Myanmar, many Myanmar Army and Police personnel posted and camped near the IMB surrendered themselves to Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles at different places. These army personnel of Myanmar were usually evacuated to safety for their return into Myanmar by the Assam Rifles. The lack of proper Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) on the issue of the surrendering of Myanmar Army personnel or government servant, if any, needed a review to devise a proper approach on the matter.

 (b) The issue of foreign National Army entering our state/country with arms and ammunitions in large numbers can post a threat to the internal security of the state as well as the country. The entry of such unauthorised armed foreign army personnel post a high risk to the population especially the residents along the Indo (Mizoram) Myanmar border areas and as such, the issue needed a long term solution.

_DRAFT COMPREHENSIVE SoP ON BORDER GRID PROTECTION ON_ _INDO- BANGLADESH BORDER_

1. Proper identification of the displaced persons from Bangladesh  presently staying in Mizoram be done and identity cards issued to  them.

2. Detention Centres be established to detain foreigners who entered  Mizoram illegally.

3. Road connectivity not only in the border villages but also between the  Sub  Divisional Headquarters and border villages be improved for  quick response. Bridge construction wherever feasible must be  considered for better connectivity.

4. Border fencing of Indo-Bangladesh border is yet to be completed. It may  be expedited. At the same time, maintenance of the border fencing  which falls apart in some areas be prioritized.

5. Use of latest technology including CCTV cameras, surveillance drones  equipped with night visions may be utilised.

6. There are a few Indian insurgent groups taking refuge in the bordering  areas of Bangladesh. As such, obtaining assistance of Bangladesh authorities would help in keeping these groups under strict  surveillance.

7. The regularity of meetings of the representatives of India and  Bangladesh needs to be improved and increased so as to assist the  dissemination of correct information, protocol adherence, and quick  action.

8. It is imperative that both India and Bangladesh urgently address the  prevailing gaps in cross-border management by formulating integrated SOPs that facilitate entry points to restrict crime.
