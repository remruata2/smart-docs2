Dated: 4th February, 2025

**Introduction :**

 On January 30, 2025, a violent confrontation broke out between the Chinland Defense Force (CDF) and the Matu Defense Force (MDF) in Zumah, Matupi District, Chin State, Myanmar. The clash, which occurred approximately 50 kilometers from the India-Myanmar border, resulted in significant casualties and injuries on both sides. This incident highlights the ongoing tensions and internal rivalries among ethnic armed groups in the region, despite their shared opposition to Myanmar’s military junta. Despite repeated appeals from NGOs and organizations such as the Zo Reunification Organization (ZORO) and the Young Mizo Association (YMA) for cooperation between armed groups to prevent further suffering, tensions continue to escalate.

**Background :**

The CDF and MDF are both prominent armed groups operating in Chin State, a region with a strong resistance movement against Myanmar’s military regime. The CDF, aligned with the Chin National Organization (CNO) and the National Unity Government (NUG), primarily focuses on broader anti-junta objectives. In contrast, the MDF represents the Matu ethnic group and pursues localized goals in Matupi District. While both groups oppose the military junta, territorial disputes and internal rivalries have frequently led to violent confrontations.


**Details of the Clash :**

The clash began when MDF cadres launched an attack on a CDF camp in Zumah. The ensuing firefight resulted in significant casualties :-

1. CDF Casualties: Approximately 14 CDF cadres were injured, with four later succumbing to their wounds.
2. MDF Casualties: A bomb blast near the CDF camp caused injuries among MDF cadres.
**Treatment in Mizoram :**

Following the clash, injured MDF fighters were transported across the border to Mizoram, India, for medical treatment. They were admitted to the Maraland Gospel Centenary Hospital, Siaha where two individuals underwent surgeries resulting in the amputation of their right legs at the ankle :

_1. Vachokhai (19), from Matupi District, Myanmar._
