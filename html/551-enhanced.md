 The PO is Ajasora (a tiny hamlet of about 14 houses) which is ½ km away from Bandukbanga village, Lawngtlai District.Keeping the sensitivity and hazard in carrying the explosive items which were recovered from the PO, they were demolished at the isolated jungle area taking all precautionary safety measures in the presence of the local police and Mr. Cheram, Asst. Commandant of 61 Bn. BSF. There is no damage/loss of any civil property during the operation.

Input received indicated that the residents of Refugee Basti/ Ajasora are known to be supporters of ALP/ALA and the BSF patrolling party seized the items from three houses of the said village. It is learnt that the owner of one of the house, i.e. Biaka is an agent of ALP and his son-in-law is also one of the ALA commanders, namely, S/S 2nd Lt. Kioksu. Information received indicated that S/S 2nd Lt. Kioksu and his party, around 13 (thirteen) ALA cadres arrived Refugee Basti/ Ajasora on 23.12.2019 from Bangladesh territory to spend Christmas festival. Knowing about their movement, BSF personnel posted at Parva, conducted operation on 24.12.2019 @ 9:30 p.m and seized the mentioned items from three different places during the operation.

It is also learnt that the operation party apprehended 3(three) ALA cadres including their commander during the operation but released them on the night itself. Consequent to the incident, SDPO Lawngtlai and party went to the PO on 25.12.2019 and the seized items were handed over to the state police by the BSF.

The present location of Biaka and S/S 2nd Lt. Kioksu is not known. In connection to the incident, S/S Lt. KhlainEpai @ Rahul of ALA expressed their displeasure against the BSF due to the incident since they feel secure under the BSF as they believed to have maintaining good relationships with BSF and Assam Rifles in the area. They further expressed their desire of releasing arms &amp; ammunitions to them also.

**Concluding Remarks:**

As per input available, Arakan Army is the dominant insurgency group in Rakhine state of Myanmar waging constant battles with the Myanmar Army. At the same time, ALP/ALA have their base camps within the territory of Bangladesh and the Myanmar Army is learnt to utilize the ALP to counter the Arakan Army and also maintain cordial relations with BSF and Assam Rifles. It cannot be ascertained at this juncture as why the seizures of arms and ammunition was done by the BSF as they are known to have maintained a cordial relation with the ALA/ALP.
