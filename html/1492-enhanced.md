****AGENDA POINTS FOR THE FORTHCOMING NORTH EASTERN REGIONAL POLICE COORDINATION COMMITTEE (NERPCC) MEETING OF THE DsGP OF NORTH-EASTERN STATES TO BE HELD ON 11TH MAY, 2021 VIA VIDEO CONFERENCING****

1. **Insurgency Problem in the Northeast:**

**The insurgency in Mizoram started as early as 1966 when the Mizo National Front (MNF) launched Operation Jericho under which they attacked the Indian defence forces stationed in and aroundMizoram. This event was a result of**widespread famine**inMizoramand the failure of the Indian government to provide adequate relief to the native people of the state. Severe counter insurgency measures were adopted by the government ofIndiaincluding bombing the capital city of Aizawl to crush militancy and the armed rebellion. This was the**first time in the history of**India, that an incumbent government dropped bombs on their own civilians in an attempt to curb insurgency. This attack left a deep scar in the heart of the Mizos and gave rise to an insurgency that would grow for the next two decades. In 1986, theMizoram******Peace Accord**was signed between the MNF and the government ofIndia. Since then,Mizoramhas been at the forefront of electoral democracy with high voter turnouts at every local, state and national election.**

After the signing of peace accord in 1986 Mizoram experienced low level of insurgency. However, some ethnic tribes demands formation of a separate autonomous district and began an armed struggles with secessionist agendas. Due to the constant efforts of Government of Mizoram, various militant groups in Mizoram viz. Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF), Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM), Bru Revolutionary Union/Bru Revolutionary Army (BRU/BRA), United Democratic Liberation Army (UDLA), Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram (BNDLFM)/ Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM), Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) and Hmar Peoples Convention (Democratic) HPC (D) etc. are considered defunct.

The ongoing Naga Political issue in the region might not have much impact in Mizoram considering low level of insurgency in the state.

1. **Indo-Myanmar Border Issue:**

 According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of unfenced International border with Myanmar, which are scattered around 30 - 40 small villages in Mizoram side. These International border posts with Myanmar are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Due to its long porous international border with Myanmar, influx of foreigners and large scale smuggling of drugs and various contrabands into the state through the porous borders has remained a serious concern for several decades.

 The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar allow Myanmar’s national to enter up to 16 kms into Mizoram Territory without any VISA restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar. At present, Assam Rifle guard Indo-Myanmar Border in order to check these illegal cross border crime activities, it is necessary to beef up security along the Indo-Myanmar.

 Maintenance of good co-operation between Border Guarding Forces and adjoining villages of the border areas is essential for effective management of Indo-Myanmar border. Being native to the areas, the knowledge of these villagers about smuggling routes, infiltration points, the terrain, etc., can be of great assets for the government and the border guard alike.

 Having a low profile close ties with ethnic leaders of Chin Hills and Arakan-Rakhine States may also be invaluable for sharing cross-border information.

**5) Myanmarese Refugee Issue**:

Military takeover took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 whendemocratically electedmembers of Myanmar'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy, were deposed by Myanmar's Military. The Myanmar Military proclaimed a year-longstate of emergencyand declared that power had been vested inCommander-in-Chief of Defence ServicesGeneral Min Aung Hlaing. It declared the results of theNovember 2020 general electionas invalid and stated its intent to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency. In protest against the Military takeover that ousted the country’s democratically elected leaders, thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Myanmar. It is reported that following the Coup thousands of Myanmar nationals have taken shelter to neighboring countries viz. India, Bangladesh and Thailand. Due to close ethnic ties thousands of Myanmar Refugees mostly from Chin state fled to Mizoram and Manipur.

The Chin state of Myanmarsharesa border with six districts of Mizoram viz. Champhai, Lawngtlai, Siaha, Saitual, Hnahthial and Serchhip . Most refugees coming in from Chin are from Lai, Tedim-Zomi, Luse, Hualngo and Natu tribes, which share close links with the Mizos of Mizoram, as well as the Kuki-Zomis of Manipur.

****Information received stated that following the Coup more than 5,000 Myanmar refugees have taken shelter within Mizoram upto the month of April, 2021. These refugees are taken care of by NGOs and their relatives in Mizoram. It is considered necessary to provide necessary assistance or maintenance of proper registration in order to avert future complexities. 

_Suggested Measures to be Taken for Prevention of Illegal Entry of Foreigners of Myanmar into Mizoram_:

1. **Strengthening of Security and Intelligence Network along Mizoram-Myanmar Border**:

In addition to deployment of Assam Rifles at the international border, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) at various Border Outposts (BOPs) along the border, supplementing the Central Armed Forces.

Apart from strengthening deployment of Assam Rifles along the border, it is also necessary to set-up new Police Stations/BOPs (with the financial assistance of Central government) along the border areas to act as a second layer behind the Assam Rifles for keeping effective watch on the infiltration of Rohingyas migrants/foreigners and other cross border criminal activities.

1. **Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agencies and Intelligence agencies about Rohingyas Crisis and its security implication, etc.**

Mizoram Police, Assam Rifles etc. should be sensitized about Rohingyas crisis/crisis in Myanmar so as to enable them to take prompt steps in identifying illegal migrants and to initiate the process of deportation, etc. This could be achieved through Seminar, Workshop, etc.

1. **Detection and proper registration of along Mizoram-Myanmar Border.**

 In order to detect illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram , 3 (three) Special Task Force (STF) had already been set up in three districts of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.

__Similarly, Special Task Force (especially for Myanmar refugees) may also be set up at the district level to identify and maintain proper registration of Myanmar refugees staying inside the territory of Mizoram in the wake of Military Coup_._

1. **Inter-State Border Issues**:

1. Border Issues with Assam:

******Assam and Mizoram share a 164.6 km inter-state boundary. There have been skirmishes on both sides earlier as well as both sides claiming portions of land along the boundary as theirs. Residents of Mizoram claimed that 1875 notification should be the boundary between Assam and Mizoram, while Assam claimed 1933 notification as the constitutional boundary between the two states.**

On 9.10.2020 @ around 2:40 p.m. one Jhum Hut belonging to Pu John Zolawma S/o of Thinghlun, located at Zaite Road around 150 meters towards Assam from Tlawngte Lui was set ablaze by Authorities of Karimganj District Administration, Assam Police and Assam Forest Officials as a result of which the said Jhum hut was burnt down to ashes, and also destroying Areca nut plants belonging to Pu John Zolawma and Pu Ben David-a of Thinghlun. In order to maintain further escalation of tension at the area, Mizoram Police personnel were immediately deployed. However, tansion sparked into other areas viz. Saihapui ‘V’, Vairengte and Bairabi, which later led to imposition of economic blockade by residents of Lailapur w.e.f. 16.10.2020 and all vehicles carrying essential commodities are not allowed to enter Mizoram. Residents of Assam organized economic blockade of all major road connecting Vairengte, Kanhmun, Bairabi and Phaisen and rail road connecting Bairabi rail station. As per direction of Central Government Border Security Force (BSF) were deployed by Mizoram Government along inter-state border on 11.11.2020 to maintain order along the border.

After several rounds of talk between officials of the two state economic blockade organized by residents of Lailapur at Lailapur was lifted on the evening of 11.11.2020. Situation along the border remained normal.

For the last 70 years after Independence, the boundary issue has remained unresolved till date. It is the aspiration of the people of Mizoram that the Central Government may constitute a Boundary Commission to look into the matter for judicious and permanent settlement of this persisting boundary problem once and for all as provided under Article 3 of the Constitution.

1. Border Issues with Tripura:

The standoff between Tripura and Mizoram over Phuldungsei Village in the Zampui Hill range, started in August, 2020 when Tripura Administration identified that 130 (one hundred thirty) people living in Phuldungsei Village were registered both in Tripura and Mizoram, had named in electoral roll, ration card and other public welfare benefit schemes of both states. Later, Tripura claimed Phuldungsei and adjoining parts (Thaidawr Tlang) are parts of Tripura.

The tension flared up after an announcement by SONGRONGMA, a local tribal organisation, which said it would construct a Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr Tlang and do community activities in the area on 19 - 20.10.2020. Mizo Students Union (MSU) and Mizo Convention, Tripura expressed their opposition and DC, Mamit issued prohibitory orders in the village. The prohibitory order was contested by Tripura on grounds of administrative command. Subsequently, after a dialogue, the temple construction and the prohibitory order were both cancelled. Mizoram Home Secretary sent its counterpart Tripura Home Secretary on 28.10.2020 wherein it reiterated that Thaidawr Tlang is a part of Mizoram, and requested to shift a contingent of about 100 Tripura State Rifles (TSR) personnel stationed at Thaidawr Tlang be shifted inside Tripura and any construction work at the area should be removed.

Further, information received stated that Tripura State Rifle (TSR) personnel obstructed the ongoing water supply work under Jal Jeevan Mission excuted by PHE Dept. Govt. of Mizoram in between Zomuantlang to Phuldungsei-Zampui on 3.5.2021. In this regard on 5.5.2021. Around 20 (twenty) persons representing All NGOs, Phuldungsei met TSR personnel on duty today i.e., 6.5.2021 @ 7:00 a.m. and informed them that they intended PHE Dept. Govt. Of Mizoram to continue the ongoing water supply work to their Village at any cost.
