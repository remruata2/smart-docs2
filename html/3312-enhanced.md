**MZP feels its untimely to repatriate Bru** : MZP expressed that it is not time for Mizoram Govt. to repatriate the Brus, it felts that repatriation should be done only after it is ascertain that they (the Brus) wanted to be repatriated.

 In a Press meeting Yesterday, MZP General Hqrs. leaders said that the Brus left Mizoram on their own accord and those who do not want to comeback to Mizoram should be deleted from Mizoram Electoral Roll, and be included in the state electoral roll of Tripura which they chose over Mizoram. MZP felts it is uncalled for on the part of Mizoram Govt. to try and lure the Brus back to Mizoram after spending lots of money in the process while the Brus themselves chose to remain in Tripura.
