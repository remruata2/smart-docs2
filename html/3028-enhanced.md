Dated: 13th September, 2019.

 Information has been received that Adjutant, 8 Assam Rifles submitted a letter to the Superintendent of Police, Champhai giving intimation on an incident at Zokhawthar. In his letter, he stated that they conducted checking of illegal trade in Zokhawthar area which heightened tension in the area. It was also stated that Law and Order situation may arise in the coming days and requested the civil administration to take necessary action.

 Information received indicated that the Assam Rifles is checking illegal trade activity in Zokhawthar and have stopped the trade of betel-nut and fertilizer across the Mizoram-Myanmar border since last Saturday, i.e. 7.9.2019. This further led to discontentment among the people of Zokhawthar since 80% of the total population is engaged as porters.

 In this regard, it is learnt that the VC of Zokhawthar met the Deputy Commissioner, Champhai on 11.9.2019, but are not satisfied with the outcome of the meeting as they considered the Deputy Commissioner as supporting the action of the AR. NGO Coordination Committee, Zokhawthar is intending to convene a meeting in the next 2 - 3 days. It is also learnt that a group of porters are intending to directly approach the AR camp at Zokhawthar, but they are being dissuaded by the VC and NGO leaders.

 Situation is under watch.
