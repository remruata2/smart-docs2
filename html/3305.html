He also said if the government could not rescue them; there were Mizo youths who could. He felt sad about the Government of not being able to rescue the 5 abducted persons and stated that 20 kidnapped cases had already occurred during the tenure of the present Government.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Pu R.Lalzirliana, Home Minister, reacting to the above statement, said that there were only 4 kidnap cases occurred in the present Government and not 20. Out of the 4 kidnapping cases, the victims were non-Mizos in 3 kidnapped cases. As the victims were all Mizos in the current kidnap case, it was very hard to take actions at the stake of risking their lives. Government was doing its best to rescue them and had high hope for the safe release of the abductees. Home Minister said that the abductors abducted the 5 people mistakenly as they thought them to be some other people and hoped that the abductors would release them soon.</span></span></span></p>
