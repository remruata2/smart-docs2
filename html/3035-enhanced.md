****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/738

Dated: 30th September, 2019.

3 (three) NGOs of Bru Relief Camps, Tripura, viz. MBDPF (Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Forum), BTDS (Bru Tribal Development Society) and MBIDM (Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement), wrote a joint letter today, i.e. 30.9.2019 on the subject, ‘Submission of public consensus in regard to the upcoming Bru Repatriation Movement Plan submitted by the Mizoram Home Department’. The letter was addressed to the Hon’ble Home Minister, Government of Mizoram, through the District Magistrate &amp; Collector, North Tripura District, Dharmanagar.

The letter pointed out that the decision of the MHA and the Movement Plan for repatriation submitted by the Govt. of Mizoram was tabled and discussed in a public meeting in the presence of all inmates. Many people protest the upcoming repatriation and that the transit camps set up by the Govt. of Mizoram are not appropriate for human habitation. It also pointed out the fear of the inmates that they might be losing their identity if they go back to their homeland in Mizoram. The people of the relief camps have decided not to go back to Mizoram till their demands are properly addressed.

The letter humbly informed the Hon’ble Home Minister of Mizoram not to send officials and vehicles to relief camps for repatriation process as the efforts would go in vain. It also stated that it is mandatory to arrange the JMG Meeting in a place nearby the relief camps so as to address their problems.

The leaders of Bru NGOs are reported to be in the Office of District Magistrate, Dharmanagar, North Tripura to submit the letter at the time of writing the report.

 At the same time, information has been received that the District Magistrate &amp; Collector, North Tripura, Dharmanagar will convene a meeting with leaders of MBDPF and Camp-in-Charge of Naisingpara, Ashapara and Hazacherra tomorrow, i.e. 1.10.2019 @ 11:00 a.m at Revenue Dak-Bangalow, Kanchanpur, Tripura to review the repatriation process.
