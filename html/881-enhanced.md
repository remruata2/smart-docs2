**1. Security:** 

**(****a)Insurgent Group along the border** **:**

 Presently, the Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) and Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) (Manipur based insurgent groups) are having permanent camp inside Myanmar adjacent to Mizoram. This matter needs to be discussed seriously with Myanmar government since the PLA and ZRA are imparting training to various underground outfit of the Northeast. It has also been ascertained that different Northeast insurgent groups like United National Liberation Front(UNLF), National Democratic Front of Bodo Land(NDFB), United Liberation Front of Assam(ULFA) and National Liberation Front of Tripura(NLFT) etc occasionally have meetings inside Myanmar and used Mizoram as a conduit for illegal movements and activities. Alertness must be maintained regarding this matter.

 **(b) Arms Smuggling :**

 Mizoram being located at a strategic point with foreign countries with porous international borders, has been vulnerable, a conduit for transporting arms and ammunitions, drugs and contraband items by various insurgent groups and smugglers. However, due to the sustained efforts by Mizoram Police, during the last one year (i.e. 2015) as many as 39 sophisticated weapons and about 6586 ammunitions were recovered from various arms smugglers and insurgent groups which clearly highlighted the vulnerability of the State as a transit route for arms smuggling.

 Besides, contraband goods coming from Myanmar side and illegally entering into Mizoram through Myanmar - Mizoram border side has also negatively affected the economic growth of the State. The recent increase in the smuggling of one new type of drugs, Pseudoephedrine coming from mainland India into Myanmar side through Mizoram State has called for immediate and proper attention and Mizoram Police has made constant efforts to effect several recoveries.

**(c)Exchange of Intelligence Information :**

 Interrogation reports of captured insurgents, arms smugglers, drug traffickers may be shared uniformly at an early time to have better control of illegal and unwanted movements in the border.

**(d)Any other security issue :**

 Mizoram is having approximately 512 kms. porous international border with Myanmar. The porous international borders served as an important route for IIGs to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, etc across the borders of Mizoram. In addition, two big infrastructure project viz. Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project(KMMTTP), Bairabi-Sairang railway line being implemented in Mizoram under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners across Mizoram from Myanmar and would also encourage illegal criminal activities across the border.

**2. Cooperation in Suppression of Drugs :**

**(a) Establishment of Border Liason Offices (BLO) :**

Presently, there are no Border Liaisons Offices established in Mizoram. However, meeting of officers on border liaisoning is conducted at frequent intervals in Falam and Champhai

**(b) Drug Issues :**

 Mizoram has a long international boundary with two countries (510 kms with Myanmar and 313 kms with Bangladesh) and 284 kms of inter-state natural boundaries with three other states – Assam, Tripura and Manipur. Interestingly Mizoram lies at the periphery of the Golden Triangle historically known for its drug manufacturing and trade. Mizoram has also always been a socio-cultural corridor because, historically as well as recently, populations ethnically related to the residents of the state reside in the neighboring regions of both foreign countries and within India. This creates favorable conditions for economic and financial interactions both legal and illicit making it both a destination as well as transit point for various goods.

Among the narcotic drugs known/seized in Mizoram are substances such as Heroin, Opium, Ganja etc., while psychotropic substances include Amphetamine-Type Stimulants (ATS). Besides these, there are various synthetic drugs that are being abused and are causing socio-cultural problems among the youth.

In recent years there has been an alarming trend of smuggling of Pseudoephedrine from mainland India through Mizoram into Myanmar. The smuggled Pseudoephedrine is used for preparation of Methamphetamine in jungle labs in Myanmar. The finished products i.e. Methamhetamine tablets are then smuggled back into Mizoram from Myanmar for local consumption or further distribution in other states. Meanwhile, almost all Ganja seized by Drug law enforcement agencies in Mizoram have entered via Manipur.

**(c ) Trafficking Route :**

Due to geographic and cultural proximity with the Golden Triangle region, drugs available in Golden Triangle are more or less also available in Mizoram from across the neighbouring country of Myanmar due to unfenced international boundary.

(i) Pharmaceutical Drugs, Marijuana (Ganja) which is most commonly abused are being smuggled into the state through neighbouring states of Assam and Tripura in a case of Pharmaceutical Drugs and Manipur in case of Marijuana (Ganja).

(ii) Precursor drugs such as Pseudo Ephedrine are smuggled to Myanmar through Mizoram from North India. The pre-cursor drug is manufactured as Amphetamine-Type Stimulants that is, Meth Amphetamine in simple laboratories at Myanmar. The seizure of large quantity of Meth Amphetamine by Mizoram Police during 2013 – 2016 manifest the fact that pre-cursor drugs viz. Pseudo-Ephedrine smuggled to Myanmar through Mizoram is manufactured as Meth-Amphetamine (a dangerous banned substance) across the border and pushed back into Mizoram. The reverse trend needs serious attention by Drugs Law Enforcing agencies.

**3.** **Border Affairs Management:**

**(a) to (h)**

****There is no unresolved Boundary Pillars(BP) along the Indo-Myanmar Border in Mizoram sector (i.e., from BP1 to BP32).     

**(i) Joint Inspection of Boundary Pillars and construction of Additional Boundary Pillars****:**Joint survey, inspection and maintenance of Boundary Pillars are not regularly carried out by Survey Departments of both sides of India and Myanmar in Mizoram sector.     

**(j) Any other border issue with Myanmar:** The porous international border of Mizoram with Myanmar provided safest and shortest transit route for Insurgent Groups (IGs) to procure arms and ammunition and also to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs across the border.
