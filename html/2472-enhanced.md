******Today i.e., 6.11.2020 @ 1:10 p.m. Pu Vanlalfaka Ralte, SP, Kolasib searched for a suitable place of deployment of BSF in between Vairengte Auto Stand and Lailapur, Assam. He was accompanied by Pu Vanlalnghenga, Dy. CO, 3rd MAP, Pu Isaac C. Lalrempuia, SDO (Civil), Vairengte and SDPO, Vairengte. When they reached a place near Hawaithang Playground/Lailapur field/Kawngthar field they found OC, Dholai and party proceeding towards Vairengte and later learnt that they intended to erect Tents for SSB Camp (to be deployed by Assam government) just below Mizoram Police place of deployment at Vairengte Auto Stand. SP, Kolasib informed OC, Dholai PS that the place for setting up of SSB Camp or BSF Camp has not been finalised and no action shall be taken at this juncture. After a while Shri Bhanwar Lal Meena, SP, Cachar reached the area and he informed SP, Kolasib that the place for setting of SSB Camp was identified yesterday i.e., 5.11.2020 by IGP (L&amp;O), Assam and DIG (NR), Mizoram. However, SP, Kolasib informed SP, Cachar that the place which they had visited was a different location and that is also not yet approved by both the state governments. Both SsP left the area without making a definite conclusion as no action for setting up of BSF or SSB Camp can be taken up by Kolasib and Cachar District Authorities before approval of the proposed sites by both state governments. One platoon of 225 Bn. CRPF personnel is deployed at the site where SP, Cachar intended to set up SSB Camp to prevent escalation of tension.**
