**_ASSESSMENT OF SECURITY THREAT PERCEPTION REPORT IN RESPECT OF T. MICHAEL LAMJATHANG HAOKIP, PRESIDENT TSA_**

1. On November 17, 2024, the Joint Hnampual Students' Organisation, comprising of Lai Students' Association, Hmar Students' Association, Mara Students' Organisation, Pang Zirlai Pawl, Mizoram Bawm Students Association, Siamsin Pawlpi, and Ranglong Students' Union, issued a press release expressing their deep dismay and disappointment regarding the statement made by the Thado Students' Association(TSA) on their official Twitter account, labeling the village volunteers from our Kuki-Zo community as 'militants' on November 16, 2024 and strongly urged TSA to issue a formal apology to the Mizo community for this hurtful and offensive remark. The Press Release also condemned the statement made by T. Michael Lamjathang Haokip, TSA President on Twitter, expressing support for the Meitei community while disparaging his fellow brothers who are bravely defending their villages and warned him against visiting Mizoram due to his divisive actions, which undermine the unity of the Chin-Kuki-Zo community and betray his own people.

2. According to sources, an emissary was dispatched by TSA on 28.11.2024 to deliver formal apology to Joint Hnampual Students’ Organisation. It was reported that the emissary, after meeting with the MZP, shifted his attitude, and as a result, a formal apology was not issued. This situation further angered the Joint Hnampual Students' Organisation.

3. Zofest which is being celebrated at Lalbuanga Run in West Phaileng w.e.f 3.12.2024 till 6.12.2024 is a cultural festival celebrating the diverse tribes of the Mizos from regions including Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, Assam, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. Some leaders of the Thadou students were expected to attend the festival at West Phaileng, Mizoram. In response to this, the Joint Hnampual Students Organization decided to boycott Zofest.

4. In addition, it was learnt that T.Michael Lamjathang Haokip came to Aizawl yesterday i.e. 3.12.2024 from Gauhati flight and intended to attend ZOFEST at West Phaileng today i.e. 4.12.2024 and will depart from Aizawl at noon along with TSA delegates who reportedly will be arriving at Lengpui airport today.

5. Taking into considerations the Press Release issued by Joint Hnampual Students' Organisation and their sentiments towards T.Michael Lamjathang Haokip, President TSA, there is possibility that the Joint Hnampual Students Organization might take action if they come into proximity with T.Michael Lamjathang Haokip.
