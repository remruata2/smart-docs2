****WRITE UP ON IMMIGRATION****

 Mizoram falls under the Protected Area Regime notified under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958 and it was excluded from this Regime from 01.01.2011 till 31.12.2022 as per Circular No. 493 Dated 14.09.2017 issued by Ministry of Home Affairs (Foreigners Division) New Delhi. However, Citizens of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan and foreign nationals having their origin in these countries would continue to require prior approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs before their visit to the state. The above mentioned Circular also excluded Myanmar nationals visiting the state from the requirement of obtaining a Protected Area Permit (PAP) till 31.12.2022. This Circular also stated that registration would not be required if the Myanmar national are only passing through the state by Road with no intention of staying in that particular state.

**Mizoram and its neigbouring countries - Problems of illegal immigrants :**

 Mizoram having international border with Myanmar lies at the periphery of the Golden Triangle historically known for its drug manufacturing and trafficking. Mizoram has also been a socio-cultural corridor because historically as well as recently, populations ethnically related resides in both Mizoram and Myanmar, and this creates favourable conditions for economic and financial interactions, both legal and illicit, which makes it both a destination as well as transit points for various illegal goods. A dangerous dimension is also noticed in the symbiotic relationship existing between insurgency and narcotic trade which proliferates the existence of the drug trade and arms trafficking.

 According to the records of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram, Mizoram state shares 496.531 kms. of porous International border with Myanmar. International border out posts along the Indo-Myanmar are currently manned by personnel of the Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border. These porous international borders are vulnerable for illegal smuggling of contraband items viz. arms and ammunitions/smuggled goods, drugs etc.

 

 According to Mizoram State Boundary Committee, at least 15 Indian villages in Mizoram are now within Bangladesh side of the border due to irresponsibility of the construction companies who are fencing the Mizoram- Bangladesh border. The Boundary Committee also found that the fences pass through the middle of 20 other villages.

 There are around 30 - 40 small villages scattered in Mizoram side of the Border. It also shares 318 Km long international boundary with Bangladesh. These porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh served not only as a convenient route for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunition, to smuggle contraband goods and illicit drugs, but also for illegal migration. The Indo-Myanmar border is guarded by Assam Rifles and Indo-Bangla border by Border Security Force (BSF).

 The porous international border facilitates ease of illegal infiltration into the state from neighbouring countries and illegal migration has the potential to alter the demographic pattern of the border districts adjoining Bangladesh. It is alleged that the Chakma population in Mizoram has increased disproportionately or abnormally in the last few years mainly due to illegal infiltration from Bangladesh. The total Chakma population of Mizoram is estimated to be more than 100,000 (as per the 2011 census - 96,972 and 2001 census - 71283). The decadal growth rate of Chakma population is 36.03 percent during 2001 to 2011, which is far way higher than the state decadal growth rate during the same period is 22.78 percent (2001-2011).

 Mizoram-Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of illegal migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across Mizoram–Myanmar border.

 Southern districts of the state viz. Lawngtlai and Lunglei and Mamit in the western district are more vulnerable to illegal infiltration from Bangladesh. So far, Champhai District having international border with Myanmar has lesser reported cases of illegal infiltration as compared to the above stated districts, but it should not be neglected from the security point of view. A sizeable number of Myanmar nationals are seeking shelter within the state following Military Coup in Myanmar on 1.2.2021 and it should be constantly monitored and their further movement within the state should also be monitored in order to prevent their further retention within the state.

**Strategies to deal with the problem of illegal immigrants in the country:**

****

****The long porous international border could be a security threat and migration routes for illegal migrants to Mizoram. In recent year, it has been reported that over 2,70,000 (two lakhs seventy thousand) Rohingyas refugees entered Bangladesh through border points of Chittagong Division (Bandarban, Rangamati &amp; Khagrachhari Cox Bazar, etc.). As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division, further infiltration of illegal migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to lndia through the border of Mizoram is necessary to be prevented.

 AMilitary Coup in Myanmarbegan on the morning of 1st February 2021, whendemocratically electedmembers of the country'sruling party, theNational League for Democracy(NLD), were deposed by theTatmadaw (Myanmar Army). A sizeable number of Myanmar nationals flee to the neighbouring countries viz. India, Bangladesh and Thailand due to fear of Military persecution following Military takeover. In this connection, scores of Myanmar nationals are also taking shelter in Mizoram.

 It is necessary to explore the possibilities to tackle and check on growing influx of illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh and Myanmar.

1. **Setting up of Border Management Division****:**

 Many states in the country are having a separate Border Management Division and considering the strategic location of the state, it is imperative to set up a separate Border Management Division in the State. The state has border with militant infested Countries viz. Bangladesh and Myanmar, and States viz. Manipur, Tripura and Assam and there have been many instances of seizure of Arms, smuggle items viz. Arms, Drugs etc. and report has been received on many occasions regarding use of the state as transit by various militant groups and there have been alleged reported infiltration of illegal Bangladeshi in southern districts of the state. A separate Border Management Division under Home Department/ Police Headquarters should be set up, which will specialize in managing the border.

1. **Cross Border Delivery by Pregnant Women**_:_

  There have been reported instances in the southern districts of Mizoram that many pregnant women from Bangladesh enter the state on the pretext of seeking medical assistance and giving birth due to poor medical facilities in their area. As the new born baby has to be registered by the Hospital, they can easily get citizenship status of the country by birth. The matter has to be dealt carefully as it can be security threat for facilitating illegal infiltration and compromise Citizenship status in the Country.

1. **Setting Up of Immigration Check Post****:**

  Special attention should be given to districts having international border viz. Mamit District, Champhai District,Lunglei District,Hnahthial, Saitual, Serchhip, Lawngtlai District and Siaha District. The State is conduit for illegal migration due to its long porous international border and ethnicity linked with the bordering countries. The Chakmas/Brus community dominated areas in the southern and western part of the state should be given more focus in respect of illegal infiltration due to its reported abnormal growth rate. Immigration Check Post should be set up in areas which are vulnerable for illegal infiltration. The Immigration Check Post should be set up under the supervision and control of concern District Superintendent of Police. A proper report should be maintained at the Immigration Check Post.

1. **Strengthening of Task Force specially constituted to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram &deportation:**

 In order to detect settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram and for their deportation, 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District. These Special Task Forces should be reinforced by making separate budgetary provision, routine meeting etc. for their effective functioning.

 In order to seal the Indo-Bangladesh border, the Government has adopted multi-pronged approach which include construction of fencing, floodlighting, Border Out Posts (BoPs), induction of latest surveillance equipments like Hand Held Thermal Imagers (HHTI), Night vision Goggle/Devices, etc.

 In order to detect and deport settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram, 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three district of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.

 

 Mizoram Police have so far arrested 59 Bangladesh nationals illegally entering Mizoram during 2008-2016(till November, 2016).

 

 Illegal migration is significantly altering the demographic pattern of the border districts adjoining Bangladesh. While our general approach has been to improve the front line of the Border Security Force(BSF). It is also necessary that the State Governments be given assistance by the Centre to set-up civil police stations which could act as second layer behind the BSF/Border Out Posts (BOPs) to keep effective watch on happenings in border villages.
