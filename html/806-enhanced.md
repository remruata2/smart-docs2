****WRITE UP ON 4TH DG LEVEL TALKS BETWEEN NCB, INDIA AND CCDAC, MYANMAR ON 09-10 JULY 2019 AT NEW DELHI****

PROPOSED AGENDAE:

1. **Trend of illicit poppy cultivation & heroin production in Myanmar including precursor trafficking:**

-_Concerned of Myanmar_

1. **Illicit trafficking of Heroin from Myanmar to India:**

Mizoram has a 404kms long international border with Myanmar. Interestingly, Mizoram lies at the periphery of the Golden Triangle historically known for its drug manufacturing and trafficking. Mizoram has also been a socio-cultural corridor because historically as well as recently, populations ethnically related resides in both Mizoram and Myanmar and this creates favourable conditions for economic and financial interactions, both legal and illicit, which makes it both a destination as well as transit points for various illegal goods. A dangerous dimension is also noticed in the symbiotic relationship existing between insurgency and narcotic trade which proliferates the existence of the drug trade and arms trafficking.

It is observed that in all seizures of Heroin that originated from Myanmar since 1995, Heroin is packed using transparent polythene and further kept in soap cases of identical make of multiple colours whereas original packets originating from the Golden Triangle are known to be of larger quantity usually of 1 kg or half kg bearing certain trademarks or brand names such as Double Globe, Double Lion etc. based on interrogation of accused persons, it is strongly suspected that such original (larger packets) are re-packaged into smaller packets weighing approximately 14-15 grams and kept in soap cases by some organised gangs in Myanmar and are then trafficked to Mizoram. Such clandestine operations have been carried out consistently for over a decade.

Mizoram is a conduit for trafficking of Heroin from Myanmar to India and Bangladesh. Heroin is also among the top narcotic substances abuse in Mizoram especially among the youth. It may be noted that almost all major seizures of Heroin by law enforcement agencies in Mizoram has entered via Myanmar.

Last 4 years seizure of Heroin by Mizoram Police from 2016 – 2019 May is as under:

| **Sl.No** | **Year** | **Quantity (in kgs)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2016 | 4.434 |
|  | 2017 | 11.174 |
|  | 2018 | 12.850 |
|  | 2019 (upto May) | 1.779 |
| **TOTAL** |  | **30.237** |


1. **Illicit trafficking of Ephedrine/Pseudo-ephedrine on Indo – Myanmar Border and reverse trafficking of Methamphetamine from Myanmar to India:**

Smuggling of Ephedrine/Pseudo-ephedrine and Methamphetamine in Mizoram has been noticed in recent past. Large quantities of Pseudoephedrine are smuggled from mainland India into Myanmar via Manipur and Mizoram. It is reported that the pre-cursor drug is used for manufacturing Amphetamine-Type Stimulants, that is, Methamphetamine in jungle laboratories of Myanmar. The seizure of large quantity of Meth-Amphetamine by Mizoram Police during 2013-2018 manifest the fact that pre-cursor drugs viz.Pseudo-Ephedrine smuggled to Myanmar through Manipur and Mizoram is further used for manufacturing Meth-Amphetamine across the border and pushed back into Mizoram. However, due to continuous efforts of the Drug Enforcement Agencies, seizure of Pseudoephedrine and Methamphetamine has significantly gone down in recent years.

Mizoram is a conduit for smuggling of Methamphetamine into Tripura, Bangladesh or mainland India. Local abuse of Methamphetamine in Mizoram is still negligible.

On 01.06.2019, Mizoram Police seized 1,10,000 (one lakh, ten thousand) Methamphetamine tablets worth Rs.165 lakhs at Champhai. Two persons were arrested and upon interrogation, it was learnt that the drug consignment was to be transported to Agartala, Tripura through courier in Aizawl, who was subsequently arrested. Further investigation revealed that the arrested persons were mere transporters employed by the main smuggler assuming fake identity as MuktakUddinMezarbhuiya (48 yrs) s/o Farkan Ali Mezarbhuiya, residence ofTarapur, Silchar, Assam and is operating from Tripura. He is known to be a Rohingya. His location was subsequently tracked and promptly arrested by Tripura Police and later transported to Mizoram. It has been revealed that the real identity of the accused is ShomsulAlam, s/o Late Abdul Hamid, a Myanmarese origin of Arakan state. He is in possession of an EPIC purportedly acquired through fraudulent means in the name of MuktakUddinMezarbhuiya (48 yrs) s/o Farkan Ali Mezarbhuiya, r/o Tarapur, Silchar, Assam.

Last 7 years seizure of Pseudo-Ephedrine and Methamphetamine by Mizoram Police is as under:

| **Name of Drugs** | **2013** | **2014** | **2015** | **2016** | **2017** | **2018** | **2019** **(upto June)** | **TOTAL** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pseudo-Ephedrine | 3243.195 kgs | 878.3 kgs | 277.388 kgs | 23.850 kgs | 1330 kgs | - | - | 5752.73 kgs |
| Methamphetamine | 1.11 kgs | 19.7 kgs | 31.266 kgs | 2.13 kgs | 0.58 kgs | 134.735 kgs | 31.578 kgs | 221.099 kgs |


1. **Sharing of real time intelligence/Information and its status (if any):**

There is no institutionalised mechanism for sharing of intelligence/information between Mizoram Police and Myanmar Police. However, due to close socio-cultural affinity, unfenced border and Free Movement Regime in place, there exists frequent trans-border movement of Myanmarese into Mizoram, and this has also resulted in frequent interaction and close cooperation between Mizoram Police and Myanmar Police.

Assam Rifles are entrusted with the task of guarding the 404 kms long Mizoram-Myanmar border and they regularly hold coordination meeting with their counterpart across the border.

It is strongly suggested that the FLO meeting as decided to be convened at the 3rd Myanmar-India DG Level Bilateral Meeting on Drug Control Cooperation held at Yangon, Myanmar on 22-24 February, 2018, may be implemented and institutionalised.

1. **Exchange of information on Drug trafficking routes and best practices:**

- Increase in heroin supply from Myanmar in recent years has replaced the heavily abused drugs proxyvon/ parvon.
- Smuggling of Pseudoephedrine from Mizoram to Myanmar, though reduced in recent years, is still prevalent.
- Reverse inflow of methamphetamine manufactured from smuggled pseudoephedrine is of great concern.
- Known entry and exit routes for drugs smuggling is shown below:

1. **Exploring feasibility of Controlled Delivery Operations:**

The option of employing the technique of Controlled Delivery Operations wherein consignment of drugs after detection is allowed to go forward under the constant surveillance of officers of Drugs Enforcement Agencies with the aim of apprehending the real/main kingpin of the smuggling rackets needs to be explored. In fact, the only effective way to fight the menace of drugs smuggling is to bring to book the real actors and financiers of the drugs smuggling operations. Majority of the arrest made so far are those who are employed as couriers and transporters of drugs. At the same time, the various aspects of Controlled Delivery Operations must be given due attention and all security angles to be covered as it would entail operation beyond ones national boundary. First of all, there has to be close cooperation between Drugs Enforcement Agencies of both the countries. There should also be real time sharing of information and confidentiality of intelligence input should be maintained at all times. There is also urgent need for augmenting man power resource and technological/surveillance equipment.

1. **Sharing of best practices and training needs:**

Some of the best practices followed by Mizoram Police in combatting drug smuggling are as follow:

1. **Technical Surveillance:** Lawful interceptionof telephonic/mobile communication of suspected drugs smugglers has yielded huge success over the years.
2. **Joint operations with Assam Rifles:** Joint operations are frequently conducted with AR so as to pool resources and intelligence input for increased output.
3. **Cultivation of Sources:** Sources are placed in important villages and towns for intelligence input on movement of drugs.
4. **Random checking:** As drug smuggling becomes increasingly sophisticated with drugs smugglers constantly upgrading their equipment, mobility and network to avert detection and seizure, conventional method of checking is becoming more and more redundant. Therefore, the biggest weapon at the ready disposal of Drug Enforcement Agencies is conduct of random checking. From the end of May and beginning of June 2019, Mizoram Police has conducted major operations along the Mizoram-Myanmar border by way of numerous random checking and laying of traps. As a result, illicit drugs and other contraband items worth Rs.2,21,61,300/- were seized and 29 law breakers arrested.

There is a pressing need for conduct of Joint training of Drugs Enforcement Agencies of both Mizoram and Myanmar for better coordination and familiarization of the working system of both sides. Training may be organised by NCB in collaboration with concern Ministry at the Centre.
