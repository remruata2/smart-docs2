SECURITY SCENERIO OF MIZORAM :

 The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful. Although, Mizoram is surrounded by countries and states which are having many disturbances with respect to insurgency and terrorism.

 Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018. However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and planning to reorganise themselves which could, in due course of time, pose security problems especially in the northern most and north eastern parts of Mizoram.

Lalhmingthanga Sanate, held a meeting with RC Singson @ Ramchanlova of Thenzawl, Mizoram on 15.12.2021 at Hmarkhawlian, Assam in connection with the tense inter-state border situation.

1. To launch attack againstAssam Police deployed along Assam-Mizoram border with Arms.
2. Non-mizo residing along the inter-state border should be threatened/intimidated.
3. Sufficient number of arms and ammunitions should be procured from National Socialist Council of Nagaland –NSCN (IM).
4. Donation should be collected from residents of Saiphai, Mizoram and its surrounding areas for procurement of arms and ammunitions.

 In pursuance of the above stated Meeting’s decision, RC Singson, Commissioner/Commander -in-Chief of MBDA along with a couple of his men served ‘Demand Letter’ using HPD (D) Letter Head to Non-Mizo residents of Chemphai areas on 23/24.12.2021 and Saiphai and its surrounding areas on 25/26.12.2021.
