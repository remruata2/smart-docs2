 Reference to our Special Report No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/225 dated 1.4.2019. It has been reported that the MSU’s Eviction plan had been thwarted following coordinated efforts by DC and SP, Lunglei, who had succeeded in persuading the MSU not to go ahead with their plan to evict illegal Chakma settlers at Tuichawngchhuah. As reported earlier, DC and SP, Lunglei in close coordination with the local NGOs, held a meeting at DC’s Office, Lunglei immediately on the arrival of MSU leaders last night @ 11:30 p.m. After prolonged discussions, the MSU had conceded the appeal by the District Administration not to visit Tuichawngchhuah and await action being taken by the Government in this regard.
