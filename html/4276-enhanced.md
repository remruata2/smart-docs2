**BANGLADESH:**

 On 18th Sept. 2024, a Bengali man named Mohamed mamun, who was suspected of theft was lynched to death in Khagrachhari District of Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh by a mob consisting of ethnic communities of Chakma and Marma. Due to this incident, situation has escalated and a violent clash occurred between the Bengali settlers and the minority community in the CHT resulting in the deaths of at least three people and destruction of numerous homes and business of the Chakma community. Due to this incident, many indigenous residents of Chakma and Marma communities sought refuge in the forests since their homes were burnt to ashes. As such, there is a high possibility that the minority community members may seek refuge inside Mizoram in the near future. At the moment, there is no report of recent influx due to the incident.
