 Dated: 9th July, 2022.

****Bru Songrongma Mthoh (BSM) submitted a written request to OC, Kanchanpur PS, North Tripura District, Tripura on 7.7.2020 which stated that Bru Songrongma Mthoh General Meeting decided to construct Shivraikhung Mandir at Jampui Hill (Thaidawr tlang) on 9.7.2022 in between 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. It also stated that they expected around 400 to 500 devotees to participate in the said intended activity. In this connection, they sought permission and requested to deploy adequate security personnel.

 Upon learning the above intended construction of Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr Tlang, Mizoram-Tripura border by Bru Songrongma Mthoh (BSM), Mizo Convention of Jampui Hill Emergency Meeting held yesterday late evening i.e., 8.7.2022 decided to organize an indefinite bandh within Jampui area w.e.f., today i.e., 9.7.2022 @ 6:00 a.m. in protest against the intended construction of Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr Tlang.

 Mizo Convention Youth Wing, General Headquarters also issued a Statement yesterday late evening which stated that they will oppose the intended construction of Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr tlang by Bru Songrongma Mthoh till the very end. In this connection, they called a mass community work today i.e., 9.7.2022 @ 8:00 a.m. at Thaidawr Tlang, Phuldungsei.

 In pursuance of the above Mizo Convention Emergency Meeting decision, Mizo Convention of Jampui Hill organized an indefinite bandh w.e.f., today i.e., 9.7.2022 @ 6:00 a.m. and performed duty at Dikawn, Hmunpui, Tripura and at the road leading to Thaidawr Tlang.

 It may be mentioned that the standoff between Mizoram and Tripura over Phuldungsei Village in Jampui Hill range started in August 2020 when the Tripura Administration identified 130 (one hundred thirty) residents of Phuldungsei village were registered in Electoral Rolls, Ration Card etc. of both states viz., Mizoram and Tripura. Later, Tripura Government claimed Phuldungsei and adjoining parts (Thaidawr Tlang) as parts of Tripura. The tension flared up again after an announcement of SONGRONGMA, a conglomerate of various Bru associations’ intention to construct Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr Tlang during 19th to 20th October, 2020. The same was opposed by Mizo Students’ Union General Headquarters and Mizo Convention, Tripura. Thereafter, DC, Mamit issued ‘Prohibitory Order’ in the village in order to maintain order, which was contested by Tripura on grounds of administrative issues. After holding successful dialogue in connection with the above, the intended construction of Shiv Mandir at Thaidawr Tlang and 'Prohibitory Order' issued by DC, Mamit were cancelled.
