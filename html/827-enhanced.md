****WRITE UP/COMMENTS ON MEASURES TO PREVENT ILLEGAL ENTRY OF ROHINGYAS IMIGRANTS OF MYANMAR INTO INDIAN TERRITORITY (MIZORAM)****

**Introduction:**

 The Rohingyas crisis has deepened due to the recent (25th August, 2017) violent acts of the Muslim insurgent group acting under the banner of Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). The subsequent offensive operation launched by Myanmar Army against this Muslim insurgents resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and exodus of a fresh wave of Rohingyas from Rakhine State, Myanmar into the neighbouring Bangladesh.

 This has opened a new and complicated dimension to the already vexed issue of the Rohingyas. The vulnerability of the Rohingya migrants to radicalisation from forces inimical to India can pose a security threat to the state of Mizoram. It is in this regard that the Indian state should be careful in dealing with the issue of Rohingya migrants.

**Vulnerability of Mizoram border:**

 Mizoram has a long porous international border with two countries (512 kms with Myanmar and 318 kms with Bangladesh).****It is reported that******over 2,70,000 Rohingyas refugees have recently entered Bangladesh through border points of Chittagong Division (Bandarban, Rangamati &Khagrachhari Cox Bazar, etc).****As Mizoram shares a long porous border with Chittagong Division , further infiltration of Rohingyas migrants/refugees from Bangladesh to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.**

Border points i.e B.P.1 to B.P.17 of Mizoram -Myanmar border have also become vulnerable points for infiltration of Rohingyas migrants coming from Rakhine State through Southern Chin State of Myanmar. In addition, big infrastructure project like Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), being implemented under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners including Rohingyas across these border points i.e BP 1 to BP17 (Mizoram –Myanmar border) .

**Suggested measures to be taken for prevention of illegal entry of Rohingyas migrants of Myanmar into Mizoram.**

_(i)Strengthening of Security and Intelligence Network along Mizoram -Bangladesh Border and Mizoram-Indo Myanmar Border_.

There are 3 (three) Battalions of Assam Rifles deployed along the Indo-Myanmar border and 3 (three) Battalions of BSF deployed along Indo-Bangladesh border. In addition, the State government has deployed Mizoram Police (MAP/IR Bn.) along the border supplementing the Central Armed Forces.

Apart from strengthening deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) and Assam Rifle along the border. It is also necessary to set-up new Police Stations/Out post (with the financial assistance of Central government) within this areas to act as a second layer behind the BSF/Assam Rifle for keeping effective watch on the infiltration of Rohingyas migrants and other cross border criminal activities.

_(ii)__Fencing of__Mizoram-Bangladesh border_

In order to prevent illegal migration and illegal activities including anti-national activities from across the border, the Government of India had sanctioned the construction of border fencing with floodlights in two phases. The total length of Indo-Bangladesh border sanctioned for fencing is 3326.14 km; out of which about 2731 km of fencing has so far been completed (up to 31.12.2016). The fencing work should be expedited.

_(iii)Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agencies and Intelligence agencies about Rohingyas Crisis and its security implication, etc:_

 Mizoram Police, etc should be sensitized about Rohingyas crisis so as to enable them to take prompt steps in identifying the illegal migrants and to initiate the process of deportation, etc. This could be achieved through Seminar, Workshop, etc

****(_iv)Detection and deportation of foreigners along Mizoram-Bangladesh/ Mizoram-Myanmar Border :_

(i)Special Task Force (STF) :

In order to detect and deport settling down of illegal immigrants of Bangladesh nationals in Mizoram , 3(three) Special Task Force(STF) had already been set up in three districts of Mizoram namely Lunglei District, Mamit District and Lawngtlai District as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Each STP is headed by Deputy Commissioner of the concerned District.
