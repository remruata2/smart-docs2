**Name: Lalbiakchunga (63)**

**F/Name: Noer (L)**

**Add: Thantlang, Myanma**r

My particulars is as above. I used to live in a rented house with my wife and children at Tuikual but after our divorce I moved to Thantlang, Myanmar.

**Details of my arms smuggling runare as follows**:

1. **First smuggling run :** On March 2024 myself along with Pickup driver Lalthawmcheua carried 5000 rounds of ammunition on his Pickup (registered in Mizoram) from Myanmar to Mizoram. We entered North Vanlaiphai via Thingsai. We concealed the smuggled arms by carrying cement, spade etc on top. At Dapchhuah(Tut) we went through a Police check gate but they did not suspect us. Upon reaching Silisury, we handed over the smuggled ammunitions to Alok Bikash Chakma and his friend (Identity unknown). We then waited for the payment at Aizawl. Then the said Alok Bikash Chakma along with his friend came to Dapchhuah by Pickup along with the payment where we also proceeded to meet them. They then handed us the payment which was calculated at Rs.500/- per bullet. We then returned back to our hotel at Aizawl as we usually stay in hotels viz. Chawlhna Hotel.

1. **Second smuggling run :**On October 2024 wedelivered 12000 rounds of ammunition by hiring one Pickup vehicle from Myanmar and again driven by Lalthawmcheua. Before delivery I contacted Santi Kumar (UPDF). Then we proceeded to our destination via the same route as before. Santi Kumar came to the outskirts of Saithah Village where we exchanged the money and ammunitions. The cost of the 12000 rounds of ammunition was Rs.60 Lakhs but as Santi Kumar insisted me to say that I delivered 14000 rounds of ammunition I complied and as it was night time we did not count. As such I received Rs.70 Lakhs instead of the agreed Rs.60 Lakhs from which Santi Kumar received Rs.2.5 lakhs.

1. **Third smuggling run :**As usual, we conducted our third smuggling run by hiring Pickup (different Pickup used on each occasion) and concealing the smuggled arms/ammunitions as before. On this occasion the Pickup was driven by Sanga of Lungler, Myanmar and I waited for him at Aizawl. Santi Kumar contacted me and told me that he will send Alok Bikash Chakma to Aizawl to deliver the payment for the smuggled arms and ammunitions. I contacted Rualliansanga @Sanga and told him to deal with the process and gave him the contact number of the Pickup driver Sanga. After they contacted each other Rualliansanga@Sanga and MalsawmaLoncheu followed the Pickup by scooty till the outskirts of Saithah village where they previously made the exchange. As the buyers (CPDF) did not arrived on the given date i.e. dt.12.01.2025 my friends buried the smuggled arms and ammunitions in the forest outskirts of Saithah. Afterwards, the Pickup vehicle returned but Sanga and Malsawma spent two nights guarding the buried arms and ammunitions viz. AK 47 (6 nos.) and ammunitons (10050 nos.). One AK 47 rifle is priced at Rs.825000/- and Rs. 500/- per bullet. We then made contact with our buyers and agreed to made exchange on the14th or 15th. On the 14th myself and Lawmcheua proceeded to Saithah but as our potential buyers did not show up we went back to West Phaileng. During this time Rualliansanga @sanga, Malsawmaand Alok Bikash Chakma spent the night at BDO Office. On the next morning at around 9 AM they left the place by availing bike and scootyand were apprehended by CID personnel at the outskirts of Lallen village. Myself along with Lalthawmcheua soon followed them and we were also apprehended by CID personnel. After interrogation, we led the CID team to the outskirts of Saithah village where they seized the arms and ammunitions.

**Q :**Is Alok Bikash Chakma a member of UPDF ?

- I believe so but I am not sure. He may be an agent or a messenger.

Q : How do you procure the ammunitions ?

- From PDF, CDF etc. I collected around 2000/4000 rounds from different sources. Moreover, there are alsoarms factories at areas controlled by Karen, Kachin and MNDA (full form not known).

Q : From where do you procure AK 47 rifles ?

- Privately from arms smuggler in Myanmar. Around 1 or 2 from each.

Q : Why did CNF sell arms and ammunitions. Do you have surplus supply?

- The CNF does not have surplus supply. We do not sell from our own inventory but in order to earn cash we bought them from private sources and sell them for profit.

Q : Are other groups/outfits also involved in selling of arms and ammunitions ?

- I am not sure but I believed the Arakan Army are involved as they also resort to selling of drugs. But I cannot exactly know.

Q: How do you and Ralliansanga @Sanga come into acquaintance?

- A long time back. I used to live among the Bawms for about ten years and when I visited his village I used to eat at his house. After he came as a refugee from Parva he located me and as he has no regular jobs I used to find some work for him. He is good friend to me and has no problem in helping me when needed.
