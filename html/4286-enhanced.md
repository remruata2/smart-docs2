****NOTES ON AGENDA POINTS FOR LIA MEETING 23.10.2024****

(iii) **Recent clashes in CHT, BD and its likely spillover in CADC**:

 On 18.09.2024, a Bengali man named Mohamed Mamun, who was suspected of theft was lynched to death in Khagrachhari District of Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh by a mob consisting of Chakma and Marma communities. The situation escalated leading to violent clashes between the Bengali settlers and the minority community in the CHT which reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least three people and destruction of numerous homes of the Chakma community. Acknowledging the reported atrocities of the indigenous Chakmas in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the Chakma community of Mizoram under the aegis of Central Young Chakma Association along with all the civil society organizations of the Chakma community organized a protest rally at Kamalanagar, District Lawngtlai, Mizoram on 22.09.2024 followed by a candle lighting rally on the same night. The protest rally was participated by almost 2500 protesters who demanded the intervention of the Indian Government in the reported atrocities against the indigenous Chakma community of Bangladesh.

 The border guarding forces as well as the State Police were alerted to check any possible influx of the Chakma community of Bangladesh who had fled their homes. However, there is no report of any illegal entry of the Chakma community from Bangladesh into Mizoram, India due to the incident.

(iv) **Current situation in Bangladesh and on Indo_BD border**:

 On 17.10.2024, a special Court Bangladesh Tribunal issued arrest warrant against former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and 45 others, including her close aides, on charges of crimes against humanity during a student-led protest in July and August 2024. After the resignation of former PM Sheikh Hasina on 05.08.2024, a 17 – member interim Government, led by Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus as its chief advisor, took charge in Bangladesh on 08.08.2024.

 The Indo-Bangladesh border in Mizoram Lawngtlai and Lunglei District are actively patrolled by the BSF and the activities along the border is closely monitored by the District Police. No new influx of refugees is reported in the last 2/3 months possibly due to the political transition in Bangladesh.

(v) **Fundamental activities in BD**:

 The Kuki-Chin National Army (KCNA) staged a series of bank robberies in Bangladesh's Bandarban district in early 2024, aiming to showcase their influence and secure funds. These attacks, which involved looting cash and kidnapping a bank manager, significantly disrupted the local banking system, leaving communities with restricted access to essential services and financial transactions. The robberies also sparked fear, causing many locals to flee the area and further destabilizing daily life for residents. The combing operation conducted by the Bangladesh Army in the Chittaging Hills Tract in retaliation to the bank robberies led to the arrest of some suspected KNA cadres.

 However, with the recent change in the government in Bangladesh, there have been no new reported activities of KCNA or new arrest of KCNA members by the authorities. Security forces remain vigilant in both Bangladesh and Mizoram, monitoring potential cross-border militant movements.

 There have been instances of allegations by Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) that miscreants of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) particularly Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Shamiti (PCJSS), United Peoples Democratic Front (UPDF), Kuki Chin National Front (KNF) are either staying inside India or establishing their camps inside India which was last highlighted in the Veracity Report of BGB Booklet during the DG, BSF and DG, BGB Level Border Conference held at Dakha, Bangladesh between 5th to 9th March 2024. However, District Police and CID (SB) of Mizoram Police independently conducted spot verification/inspection during the month of August and October 2023 as well as in the month of January 2024 and found no such miscreants or their camps inside Mizoram, India particularly in Lunglei and Mamit Districts.
