Sir,

 Kindly refer to your letter vide No. AZL/V/2021(19)-490 Dt. 22.10.2021 wherein SP CID (SB) was alleged to have repeatedly sent weekly report on Insurgency related incident of violence to the wrong addressee.

In this regard, I would like you to note that this office has been sending the stated report to the concerned officer i.e., Shri. T.K Deka, SD/CT w.e.f., 9.9.2021 (_copy enclosed_) and a copy of the Message No. MSB/CB/A-97(B)/08/764 Dt. 14.10.2021 mentioned in your Memorandum was also sent to the right addressee i.e., Shri.

The error which you mentioned may be committed while transmitting the message by ISPW (Inter-state Police Wireless) for which this office has no responsibility.

It is, therefore, advised not to issue such kind of strong Memorandum without ascertaining the fact in future as it can affect the credibility of this Office or affect the existing cordial relationship between the two Agencies and in this regard, your kind cooperation is highly solicited.
