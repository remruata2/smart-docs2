1. **Signing of MoS between Hmar Peoples’ Convention (HPC) and the State of Mizoram**:

Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) was formed in 1986 with the sole objective of creation of an Autonomous District Council (ADC) for the Hmars residing in Mizoram. Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent unlawful activities thus jeopardising law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area. Government of Mizoram managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants resulting in the signing of a Peace Accord on 27th July, 1994. HPC militants surrendered formally to the Govt. of Mizoram as per the provision of this Accord and these persons were given financial grants for their rehabilitation etc. Govt. of Mizoram also agreed to set up the Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) for the socio-economic upliftment of the people living in Hmar dominated areas. Accordingly, adhoc Chairman and members constituting the Council were appointed by Govt. of Mizoram from among leaders of the erstwhile HPC set up.

Sinlung Hills Implementation Demand Committee (SHIDC) filed a petition at the Gauhati High Court, Aizawl Bench alleging that the Govt. did not fulfil the terms mentioned in the MoS relating to clause no. 5.1 and 5.3 articles relating to (i) used of Hmar language as a medium of instruction up to the primary level; (ii) recognition of Hmar language as one of the major language of the state of Mizoram; (iii) opening of SDO(C) Office with different departments; and (iv) up-gradation of PHC Sakawrdai to thirty bedded CHC.

Gauhati High Court, Aizawl Bench in its judgement passed on 4.9.2017 directed the State of Mizoram to comply with clause no 5.1. and 5.3 of the MoS and to act upon these two clauses at the earliest and preferably within a period of one(1) year from the date of the Judgment Order.
