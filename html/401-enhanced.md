Biakliana involvement:

15.2.2012 Information received from different sources revealed that representatives of all political party leaders from 12 (twelve) villages of Tuisualral numbering about 50 (fifty) met HPC-D cadres at Thingpuikual (Manipur), on the bank of Tuiruang river adjacent to Kani village (Zokhawthiang, Mizoram) @ 8:00 PM on 15.2.2012 as summoned by the HPC-D. The meeting took place in the residence of Thingpuikual village authority chairman and lasted for 2 (two) hours.

 The HPC-D cadres headed by Lalbiakliana @ Biaka, S/S Area Commander, accompanied by 8 nos. of HPC-D cadres, all armed with sophisticated AK-47 rifles and M-16 rifles told the 50 strong members of different political party leaders to help all HPC party candidates win for the ensuing V/C election within Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) area, in a polite but pursuasive and compulsive manner.

 Some of the political party leaders reached Vaitin village last night @ 9:00 PM and the second batch arrived Vaitin @ 11:20 PM last night, i.e. 16.2.2012. As per the report of political party leaders who attended the meeting, the HPC-D are very determined in their diktat and disobeying their request within SHDC area would be very risky for any political party leaders within the area. Further input received from the interaction of village leaders suggested that casting of votes with peace of mind may be impossible in this situation even if foolproof security is provided in the area during election if the result of V/C election comes out against the wishes of HPC-D insurgent group.

20.4.2012 Input received suggests that there is likelihood of the HPC(D) indulging themselves in unlawful activities in the near future to intimidate the YMA branches inside their demand area of Mizoram, in pursuance of its 'diktat' issued dt.17.4.12 for dissolution of all YMA branches within their demand area. As per the input received, SS Comdr. Lalbieklien has been entrusted to carry out the order. There are possibilities of the HPC(D) cadres either entering into Mizoram to carry out the order or intimidate the YMA leaders through phone calls.

 The HPC(D) feels an urgent need of recruiting more cadres from Mizoram as they are convinced that their recent press release had hearted the sentiments of the Central YMA as well as the entire establishment.

 In the meantime, the Central YMA are understood to be considering whether or not to visit Sakawrdai area as leaders of the YMA branches in the area are reportedly panic following the HPC(D)'s intimidation.
