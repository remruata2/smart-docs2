****INTERNAL SECURITY****

The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful.

 Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (The insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decades armed insurgency of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where around 102 Cadres and 12 Council Members of HPC(D) came to over ground at the ceremony. However the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and planning to reorganise themselves which could, in due course of time, pose security problems especially in the northern most and north eastern parts of Mizoram.

 As for the North-Western region, the Bru insurgency has been contained to a great extend so much so that this insurgent Group has become more or less a group of Bandits without any specific demands or objectives. Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF) which was formed in 1997 signed Peace Accord with Govt.of Mizoram on 26.4.2005 and surrendered to the Government on 25.7.2005 and 195 Cadres came overground along with 9 Weapons. Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram(BLFM) surrendered to the Government on 26.10.2006. About 804 Cadres came overground with 66 weapons and 45 ammunitions.

 However, Mizoram is having approximately 404 kms. and 318 kms. porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively. It has boundary of 123 kms with Assam, 66 Kms with Tripura and 95 Kms with Manipur. Security of Mizoram is entrusted mainly with Mizoram Police with sister agencies namely, Assam Rifles, Border Security Force and Central Reserve Police Force. Mizoram Police deployed MAP/IR along international and interstate borders. 3 Battalions of Assam Rifles(AR) manned the Indo-Myanmar border in the East and South while 3 Battalions of Border Security Force(BSF) manned the Western border with limited man-power which leaves many pockets vulnerable to infiltration. The porous international borders served as a possible route for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, etc across the borders of Mizoram. Influx of illegal foreigners from Bangladesh and Myanmar into Mizoram could also create deeper problems.

There has been many instances of Arakan Army(AA) along Mizoram-Myanmar border in the past years. The**Arakan Army**is aRakhine InsurgentinMyanmar, founded on the 10th April 2009.It is the armed wing of theUnited League of Arakan( ULA). The purpose of the AA is to protect Arakan people and to establish peace, justice, freedom and development. They often have exchange of fire along the border and illegally entered into Mizoram territory.

Information has been received that there was an encounter between Mynamar Army and rebel Arakan Army (AA) on 26.2.2018 @ 11:00 a.m at Kumprang village on Myanmar side of the border close to Kakichhuah of Lawngtlai District. Some firing incidents between Arakan Army and Myanmar Army have been reported since then.

 Following is the latest update on refugee status at Hmawngbuchhuah as on 3.9.2018:-

 (i) Male - 75

 (ii) Female - 94

 (iii) Minor (Male) - 35

 (iv) Minor (Female) - 34
