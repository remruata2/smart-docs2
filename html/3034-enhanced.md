 The NGO Co-Ordination Committee (CYMA, MUP, MHIP, MZP &amp; MSU) convened its meeting today, i.e. 27.9.2019 @ 3:00 p.m under the chairmanship of Pu Vanlalruata, President, CYMA at CYMA Committee Room, Aizawl and 15 (fifteen) members attended. The meeting discussed Pu Amit Shah, Union Home Minister and BJP National President, scheduled visit to Mizoram on 5.10.2019 and the intention of the Central Government to reintroduce Citizenship Amendment Bill -2016 (CAB-16) in the Parliament.

 The meeting, as a mark of protest and opposition against the Central Government’s intention to revive CAB-16, resolved that Mizo people will stand and line up all along the roadside where the Union Home Minister will be moving in Aizawl City during his visit. It also decided that ‘Pawndum’ (Mizo traditional shawl) should be worn by all and placards condemning and opposing CAB-16 to be widely displayed. A Press Release to this effect was issued by the NGOCC today and it also urged all the people to render their support and cooperation.

 Situation is under close watch.
