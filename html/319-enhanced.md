Subject: Security threat perception assessment report.

Ref: No.SEC/R-40/2013/210 dt. 8.8.13.

Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, I am sending herewith the verification report of threat perception in respect of Pu Michael Lalrinsanga Sailo, CJM Aizawl, Mizoram for providing Personal Security Officer to him in pursuant to his application submitted to SP, Security, Aizawl.

 In the course of stringent assessment conducted, the CJM was personally contacted who stated that he was assigned with the task of taking up of 16(sixteen) Chiahpuam cases and he intend to begin trial on the second week of August 2013. It may be undoubtedly be a security/law and order issue at the Court Office/premises as has seen in the past due to the large amount of money involved in these cases. He also stated that he had a wife and 2(two) minor kids who would also come under the ire of certain individuals considering the nature of the cases. Though in view of the nature of the work and the potential threat that may arise out of the execution of the power vested in the CJM, it has been ascertained that he has not received any threat from any corner as yet.

Yours faithfully,

Superintendent of Police

CID (SB), Mizoram, Aizawl
