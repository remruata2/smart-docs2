Subject: Assessment of threat perception.

Ref: No:SEC/R-40/2012/94 dt.28.1.2014.

Sir,

 With reference to your letter no. and subject cited above, I am submitting herewith the assessment of threat perception in respect of Pu Lalnunsanga, DFO, Kawrthah Division for your kind information and necessary action.

In the course of stringent assessment conducted on 28.1.2014, the said DFO of Kawrthah Division was contacted and stated that though he did not receive any particular threat from anywhere ie, by letter, through telephone/SMS, he required PSO while implementing forest protection and to carry out inspection of his division due to recent kidnap incident that made him afraid of visiting and working in plantation of remote places.

Based on the aforesaid circumstances and assessment conducted by personal of Special Branch, it is suggested that the said DFO of Kawrthah Division may be provided PSO at the moment which may be withdrawn as and when the situation calmed down or when the authority consider it necessary.

   Yours faithfully,

**  (H.RAMTHLENGLIANA)**
