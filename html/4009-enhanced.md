****NOTES FOR MEETING ON ENTRY- EXIT POINTS ON 21.03.2025****

The Indian government has introduced new regulations to oversee movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). On December 24, 2024, the MHA announced a revised protocol that decreases the Free Movement Regime (FMR) range, shrinking it from 16 km to 10 km.

Security along the 510-km Indo-Myanmar border has been intensified, and now residents residing within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border must secure a Border Pass for travel. The new regulations restrict the movement of individuals from 16 km under the previous FMR to 10 km now, on either side. Only those residing in the "border area"—defined as within 10 km on either side—are eligible to apply for the "Border Pass" for up to a seven-day stay; such pass-holders are required to return it at the same crossing point where it was issued. Residents of villages beyond the "border areas" (the 10-km zone) and citizens of any third country are ineligible for the Border Pass. As per MHA letter, **there are total eighteen(18) identified Entry/Exit points in six(06) districts of Mizoram and five(05) Entry/Exit points covered in Pilot Phase and Phase-I have been operative till date.**

**PILOT PHASE:**The new guidelines was implemented w.ef. 30.12.2024 at Zokhawthar and Hnahlan, Champhai District which are pilot sites for new Entry and Exit point.

**PHASE-I:**Entry and Exit point along with Indo-Myanmar Border at Lawngtlai District in Mizoram started operation w.e.f. from 23.01.2025 at Zochachhuah, Hruitezawl and Laitlang.

The identified check gates in each of these areas is deemed too far from the villages and a meeting on 21.01.2025 at 05:15 pm held under the chairmanship of Secretary (BM), MHA on the entry/Exit points along Indo-Myanmar Border(IBM) resolved that it must be re-verified. After the verification, the same duty point for Entry/Exit point as proposed is approved and SP Lawngtlai posted 2 police personnel in each of these 3 places.Border Pass/Permit issued in these three(03) Entry/Exit points till **19.03.2025** is given below:

**Finalization of Entry-Exit Points:**

 Meeting in connection with designated entry-exit points at the IMB was held on 06.03.2025 at DGP Conference Hall.

  The proposals on entry-exit points along the Indo-Myanmar Border were discussed one by one, based on the proposed list prepared by AR. After considering the opinions of the District SPs, SIB, and Assam Rifles, and taking into account the volume of human traffic at each proposed site, a list of the proposed designated entry-exit points was made as follows.

****Note:**__Two entry-exit points, namely (a) Mimbung-Tuisia River, Saitual District, and (b) Bulfekzawl, Champhai District, were excluded from the list after thorough discussion on their viability.**

The new list of Entry-Exit points will be considered final, and necessary action is under process for their operation.

**Main reasons for overstay:**

1. No mechanism to check whether the incoming Myanmar citizens have crossed the 10 km radius from the IMB.
2. Tracing of those who overstayed is difficult since the system which issued Border Pass does not mandate phone number or any other features which could help Police to trace overstayals.
3. Some have returned to Myanmar from other routes which are not covered in the Pilot Phase since there are 28 identified crossing points in Champhai district alone.
4. Lack of awareness among the public. Those who will be overstaying should apply to renew their Border pass/permit.
