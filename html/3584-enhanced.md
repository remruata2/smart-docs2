**Request made to Minister to abolished black marketing of petrol :**Mizoram Merchant Association (MIMA) has expressed that main reason for shortage of petrol at pump in times of limited supply is due to the hoarding resorted by black marketers. Yesterday, the Association had met Civil Supply &amp; Consumer Affairs Minister of Mizoram and discussed that restriction order often made by the government is not an immediate remedy to solve the shortage of petrol as black marketers often stock petrol to sale later at higher price. They further requested the Minister to take stringent action to do away with black marketing of petrol.
