****Subject : Implementation of Revised Free Movement Regime (FMR) and Border Pass Regulations along the Mizoram-Myanmar Border.****

****

Sir,

I am writing to bring to your esteemed attention the recent directives issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Government of India, concerning the revised Free Movement Regime (FMR) along the Mizoram-Myanmar border. As per MHA Notification on dated 24th December, 2024, the FMR range has been reduced from 16 kilometers to 10 kilometers on either side of the international border. The revised regulations, which came into effect on 30th December, 2024, mandate the issuance of a Border Pass for residents within the 10 kilometer zone, permitting a stay of up to seven days.
_1. Exemption under G.S.R. No. 1265:_

The Central Government, vide G.S.R. No. 1265, has exempted members of hill tribes, whether citizens of India or Myanmar, residing in the border areas under the Free Movement Regime, from the requirement of Rule 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950, subject to specified conditions.
_2. Meeting chaired by Secretary (BM), MHA :_

   On 16th December, 2024, a meeting was convened under the chairmanship of the Secretary (Border Management), MHA, wherein State Governments were informed of the Government of India’s decision to regulate the FMR through the issuance of Border Passes. The Border Pass will be issued by the Assam Rifles based on the following criteria :-

i) Proof of Identity (POI) : A certificate issued by OC/SHO of Local Police Station (PS) or the local village chief/authority, confirming that the individual belongs to a village within 10 kilometers on either side of the international border.

ii) Passport: The passport of the individual must indicate the address and name of the village falling within the 10 kilometers zone on either side of the international border.

In light of these developments, I would like to highlight the following key points and seek necessary action from your esteemed office :-

_1. Identification of Villages within the 10 Kilometers Border Zone :_

As of now, the villages within 10 kilometers of the Mizoram-Myanmar border (on the Indian side) have not been officially identified. It is imperative that the District Deputy Commissioners (DCs) of the concerned districts undertake the task of identifying these villages and sharing the list with the Assam Rifles and the Police Department at the earliest. This will facilitate the smooth implementation of the Border Pass system and ensure compliance with the revised regulations.

_2. Border Pass Regulations :_

  Only residents within the 10 kilometers border zone on either side of the international border are eligible for the Border Pass. The Border Pass permits a stay of up to seven days and must be returned at the same crossing point where it was issued. Residents beyond the 10 kilometers zone and citizens of third countries are ineligible for the Border Pass.

_3. Operational Timings :_

The Entry and Exit points will operate from Monday to Saturday, between 6:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.

_4. Coordination with Civil Authorities :_

Close coordination between the District Deputy Commissioners, Assam Rifles, and the Police Department is essential for the effective implementation of the revised regulations. I request your office to direct the concerned DCs to expedite the identification of villages within the 10 kilometers border zone and share the list with the relevant security agencies.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,

****(H. RAMTHLENGLIANA) IPS****
