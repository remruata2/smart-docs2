No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/122

Dated: 18th February, 2019.

In continuation to our Special Report No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/104 , Dt.15.2.2019, there was a slight tension at Zophai this morning, i.e. 18.2.2018 @ 7:30 a.m as IR Bn. personnel doing their rounds of foot patrolling were confronted by Bengali tenants, mostly women brandishing dao/machete and sticks. Police team led by Addl. SP, Kolasib were immediately despatched and O/C, Ramnathpur PS and party also arrived at the spot where both Mizoram and Assam Police had a discussion about the circumstances of the incident.

It was revealed during inquiry conducted at the spot that one Giyas Uddin (58 yrs.) S/o Issak Ali of Gollacherra had raised a false alarm at the sight of Mizoram Police patrol party as he mistakenly thought that the Mizoram Police had come to arrest him. The said Giyas Uddin happened to be the tenant who was looking after the paddy field of Pu Dohlira of Mission Veng, Aizawl and had refused to give share of harvest to the landlord and thus instigated others. He was located and warned not to repeat such acts which could flare up tension in the area.

As instructed by DIG(NR), SP, Kolasib will proceed to Zophai, Bairabi tomorrow, i.e. 19.2.2019 to take stock of the situation. He will hold a meeting with All NGOs at Bairabi and thereafter meet SP, Hailakandi as well.
