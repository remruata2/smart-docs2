No. MSB/CB/SR/2021/757

Dated: 11th Oct., 2021

 As per input, around 500 (five hundred) residents of Dulte and Kawlkulh, Khawzawl District, gathered at DBL Construction Camp, Dulte today, i.e., 11.10.2021 @9:00 a.m. and obstructed the ongoing construction work of Dulte-Kawlkulh by-pass road under NHIDCL. They informed the DBL construction workers to remove their machineries and also requested the District Administration not to continue the said work. A Public Meeting was subsequently held under the joint aegis of Joint Action Committee for NH-6, Kawlkulh Thalai Pawl and Dulte Economic Development in connection with their standing opposition to construction of NH-6 Dulte/Kawlkulh by-pass road. The meeting passed the following resolutions:
(i) Residents of Kawlkulh and Dulte will not allow any road construction within their Village Council jurisdiction areas at any cost if the construction of NH-6  by-pass their villages. Further, they will not be held responsible for any unwanted  incident that befall upon the construction company if the road construction work  is carried out against their wish.
(ii) They will not stage any protest/obstruction if NH-6 is constructed without  passing through Kawlkulh and Dulte Village Council jurisdiction areas.

(iii) Continued construction of Dulte/Kawlkulh By-pass road in neglect of their  repeated requests to leaders of the State and Central Ministry that NH-6 is the  main source of their livelihood has hurt their sentiment. Such being the case, they  will not be responsible for occurrence of any unwanted incident upon company workers if the construction work continues.
 The road construction work towards Kawlkulh side was withdrawn due to the above protest and the crowd dispersed @1:30 p.m. this afternoon without any untoward incident. 20 (twenty) police personnel led by Pu Lalringliana Pachuau, Addl. SP Khawzawl, 1 (one) platoon of 2nd IR Personnel and Pu James Lalnithanga, SDO (Sadar), Khawzawl were present at the site to take stock of the situation and to prevent any untoward incident.

 Situation is under close watch.
