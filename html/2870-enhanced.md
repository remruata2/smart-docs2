_INDO-MYANMAR/INDO-BANGLADESH BORDER SECURITY :_

_kuki chin national front (KNF) :_

 This organisation was founded in the year 2008 by elements of Zo- ethnic living in Bangladesh as Kuki-Chin National Development Organisation (KNDO).

 Two years after its establishment,leaders of this organisation sought assistance from Kachin National Army (KNA), a militant outfit operating in Myanmar, for training which resulted in about 20-40 KNDO cadres receiving training from KNA during the year 2017-2020. After these cadres completed their training, their organisation was renamed as Kuki Chin National Front (KNF).

 The main objective of this organisation is to unite Zo-ethnic tribes including CHIN tribes living in Myanmar - Bangladesh bordering areas into one autonomous region having a development budget of their own from Bangladesh Government.

 It may also be mentioned that, after the completion of their training under KNA, cadres of KNF did not take any Arms and Ammunitions with them as this could hamper their safe return journey home to Bangladesh.

 Leaders of Kuki-Chin National Front from Bangladesh frequently visited Mizoram where they often met leaders of PAMRA and even Government officials whenever necessary. Some of them even proceeded up to Myanmar during these visits.

CAMPS: The Head Quarters of KNF is situated at SALOPI, Bandarbham district, near RUMA BAZAR in Bangladesh. Other camps are also established at Chittagong and Khakrasuri areas.

CAMPS INSIDE MIZORAM: Presently, KNF has no camp inside Mizoram.

NUMBERS OF CADRES: KNF claims to have around 700 cadres which includes civil and Army wing. However, other source believed them to be around 500-600 in numbers.

KNF IN AIZAWL/MIZORAM: At present, there are no top officials nor Leaders of KNF in Mizoram as all of them are in Bangladesh. At the same time 2/3 of their cadres are presently staying in Aizawl.

_Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) Eastern Command :_

 The operational areas of ZRA Eastern Command, who are commanded by SS Colonel Kham Min Thang includes the areas around Tidim,Tonzang and Chikha inside Myanmar.

 For a long period, ZRA had prohibited the establishment of any armed group within their operational areas. However, after the creation of Civil Disobedience Movement as a result of the 2021 military coup of Myanmar, several armed groups have sprung up which includes People Defence Force (PDF) Zoland inside the operational areas of ZRA. This greatly displeased ZRA who strongly opposed the activities of PDF Zoland, often resulting in threats and even violence against these PDF Zoland members.

 Below are some of the instances when ZRA resorted to intimidation and violence against PDF members :

1. From the month of May 2021,elected MLA/MP from Tidim and Tonzang township who fled to Mizoram have received repeated threatening calls through mobile phones.

2. Five (5) persons from Khawzimpui village were severely beaten on September 2021.

3. During the month of June/July 2021, PDF cadres, who were undergoing training inside Ngur Village Council areas on the banks of Tiau river were scattered and their belongings destroyed by ZRA.

4. On 5.12.2021(Sunday), one Cin Siam Sum,who is a former Personal Secretary to an Ex-Minister, Mr.Mang Hen Dal, was murdered in his residence of Tidim township by 2 ZRA cadres.

 Apart from the above mentioned incidents, PDF members have often received threats and warning from ZRA multiple times through direct verbal and mobile phone calls.

 To this day, there has been no reports of SS Colonel Kham Min Thang and his men entering Mizoram territory be it the district of Champhai nor Saitual district. To corroborate this, when ZRA agent in Champhai and their PRO at Hrianghmun were contacted, they clearly express their unawareness of any ZRA Eastern Command personnel entering inside Mizoram.

SECURITY SCENERIO OF MIZORAM :

 A couple of years back, Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018. However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and planning to reorganise themselves which could, in due course of time, pose security problems especially in the northern most and north eastern parts of Mizoram.

Lalhmingthanga Sanate decided to raise new outfit in the name of “Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA)” with the following plan of actions:

1. To launch attack against Assam Police deployed along Assam-Mizoram border with Arms.
2. Non-mizo residing along the inter-state border should be threatened/intimidated.
3. Sufficient number of arms and ammunitions should be procured from National Socialist Council of Nagaland –NSCN (IM).
4. Donation should be collected from residents of Saiphai, Mizoram and its surrounding areas for procurement of arms and ammunitions.

 In pursuance of the above stated Meeting’s decision, RC Singson, Commissioner/Commander -in-Chief of MBDA along with a couple of his men served ‘Demand Letter’ using HPD (D) Letter Head to Non-Mizo residents of Chemphai areas on 23/24.12.2021 and Saiphai and its surrounding areas on 25/26.12.2021.

OTHER RELEVANT POINTS :

 On 18.3.22 @ 8:45 am, an explosion occurred at a Automobile Workshop at Durtlang Mual Veng run by one Lalhmangaihzuala of Durtlang Mual Veng on Selsish- Zuangtui Road nearby the building of Home of Hope belonging to Pu C.Laldawngliana of Ramhlun South. According to the nearby residents, on that morning one Pickup vehicle entered into the Workshop and soon after a big explosion took place inside the workshop, as a result of which the rear of the Bolero Pickup vehicle was badly battered and blown up and the vehicle was shrilled out from inside the workshop to the main road. Four persons who were found in badly mutilated condition were taken out from the spot, two of them were found already dead while two, who were still breathing were evacuated to Presbyterian Hospital Durtlang. The velocity of the explosion was so severe that it trembled the nearby buildings causing extensive damage to them, besides causing damage to some vehicles parked nearby. The tin shade automobile workshop was also blown into pieces. The dead bodies, identified as Lalhmangaihzuala (29) s/o Lalngilneia of Durtlang Mual Veng owner of the automobile workshop and Lalthafamkima(48) h/o Pardingliani of Sakawrdai P/A Thuampui, Aizawl, owner of Pick-up (Bolero) B/R No. MZ01-S-5983, were subjected to thorough inquest and were then forwarded to Civil Hospital, Aizawl for conducting Post-mortem Examination. Meanwhile, Immanuel Lalmawikima (18) s/o Henry Lalrotluanga of Sakawrdai who was found to be a worker of the automobile workshop and was evacuated to Presbyteria Hospital Durtlang, succumbed to his injuries there at Presbyterian Hospital Durtlang, while another injured person duly identified as Thangsohrai (25) c/o Laltanpuii of Hunthar Veng (near BBC) Damparengpui, apparently the driver of vehicle Pik-up (Bolero) B/R No. MZ01-S-5983 was fighting for his life. Hence the dead body of the said immauel Lalmawikima was also forwarded to Civil Hospital, Aizawl for Post-mortem Examination, after it was subjected to thorough inquest. It further revealed that, two residents of Durtlang Mual Veng namely Lalramzauva(69) s/o Thangruaia(L) of Durtlang Mual Veng Sihpui Road and Zoramsanga 32 yrs s/o Lalvela of Durtlang Mual Veng Sihpui Road were also hit by the shrapnel of the explosion and sustained injuries on their person. The duo was medically examined at Civil Hospital, Aizawl and Injury report revealed that both of them suffered minor injuries. The Place of occurrence, and the vehicle Pik-up (Bolero) B/R No. MZ01-S-5983 which was considered as epic centre of the explosion was minutely examined with the help of ballistic experts from FSL Aizawl. During the wake of inspection, debris of bunches of burnt conducting detonator wires were found scattered here and there in and around the epicentre of the blast. Further, thorough search of the cabin of the vehicle Pik-up (Bolero) B/R No. MZ01-S-5983 led to the recovery of 18 bundles consisting of 900 pieces of Instantaneous Electric Detonator (class-6, Division 3) which were stacked in a plastic sack, further concealed behind the co-driver seat. Further, it was deduced by the FSL experts from the nature of the damage caused to the rear body of the said Pik-up (Bolero), that a huge quantities of Instantaneous Electric Detonator which caused the blast were apparently stacked inside a secret box that was believed to be especially carved out beneath the rear body of the Pik-up (Bolero) for smuggling of the explosive in question. All these facts clearly being indicative of the Pik-up (Bolero) being used by its owner Lalthafamkima (48) h/o Pardingliani of Sakardai P/A Thuampui, Aizawl, for smuggling of explosive substances i.e. Electric Detonators, which according to FSL ballistics experts contains PETN (Pentaerythritol Tetranitarte) Explosive. It was further concluded that the Pik-up (Bolero), while being subjected to oxy-welding at the aforementioned Automobile workshop, the oxy welding incidentally ignited the stacked Electric Detonators which triggered the huge explosion.

 Preliminary investigation substantiated that, the owner and driver of Pik-up(Bolero) B/R No. MZ01-S-5983 Lalthafamkima (48) h/o Pardingliani of Sakawrdai P/A Thuampui, Aizawl (already dead) and its driver Thangsohrai (25) c/o Laltanpuii of Hunthar Veng (near BBC) Damparengpui (under intensive care at Presbyterian Hospital Durtlang) were engaged in clandestine business of explosive substances i.e. Electric Detonators which according to FSL ballistics experts contains PETN (Pentaerythritol Tetranitarte) Explosive and their further negligent conduct and dealing with the noted explosive substances resulted in huge loss of human life, injuty and damage to properties of others as mentioned above.
