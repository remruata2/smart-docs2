Ref. :  No. CB/PHQ/BNLF/08/143 Dt. 21.4.09

Sir,

 With reference to the above noted subject and reference, I have the honour to submit a comment on the representation submitted to the Hon’ble Chief Minister, Govt. of Mizoram by Pu Sapchhunga for favour of information please.

1.  The Bru National Union (BNU) formed in 1994 submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister of India for a creation of a separate Autonomous District Council for the Brus on 5.12.96, on the Western Belt of Mizoram bordering Tripura state and Bangladesh. The Special Conference of the BNU on 23-24/9/97 at Saipuilui village of Mamit District also passed a resolution for the same.

2.  To spearhead and carry forward the demand of ADC for the Brus, an insurgent outfit called Bru National Liberation Front was formed on 9.11.96 at Tuirum under the leadership of President Vanlalliana. Since then the BNLF carried out violent activities in various parts of the state especially in their demand areas.

3.  After 12 rounds of peace talks, a memorandum of understanding was signed by the BNLF and the Govt. of Mizoram on 26.4.05 wherein the BNLF gave up/surrendered all the political demands. The Govt. of Mizoram granted general amnesty to all the BNLF cadres and agreed to rehabilitate and resettle the BNLF cadres and their families and accelerate the pace of development in the western belt of Mizoram covering all Bru settlements.

4.  The Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM) formed in December, 2001 under the leadership of Vanlalliana took up arms struggle against the state for the Brus. The BLFM movement was however, short lived due to one or the other reasons. The BLFM unconditionally surrendered and laid down their arms en masse before the Govt. on 26.11.06. They were then rehabilitated and resettled in various parts of Mamit District, Kolasib District and Lunglei District.

Yours faithfully,

Superintendent of Police
