**Concluding Remarks:**

As per input available, Arakan Army is the dominant insurgency group in Rakhine state of Myanmar waging constant battles with the Myanmar Army. At the same time, ALP/ALA have their base camps within the territory of Bangladesh and the Myanmar Army is learnt to utilize the ALP to counter the Arakan Army and also maintain cordial relations with BSF and Assam Rifles. It cannot be ascertained at this juncture as to why the seizures of arms and ammunition was done by the BSF as they are known to have maintained a cordial relation with the ALA/ALP.
