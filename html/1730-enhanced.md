**Reports regarding movements/activities of Arakan Army(AA) within Mizoram :**

 Prior to the year 2018/2019, Arakan Army (AA) had established their camps very close to Mizoram border, inside Myanmar, along the Indo (Mizoram)-Myanmar border. As such, they often ventured discreetly inside the bordering villages inside southern parts of Mizoram state for provisions and medical supplies and even secretly stayed in villages inside Mizoram and even at Lawngtlai.

 Myanmar Army launched an intensive operation against the AA in 2019 and at the same time, Indian Army and Assam Rifles, anticipating this crack down and possible infiltration inside Mizoram territory, deployed huge numbers of troops along the Mizoram-Myanmar borders and it was not possible for the AA cadres to enter into Indian territory. Nevertheless, a couple of injured/wounded AA cadres were smuggled inside Mizoram for medical treatment.

 By the end of 2019, as a result of these operations conducted by Myanmar Army and with the concentration of large numbers of Indian Army and Assam Rifles personnel along the border, the situation became desperate for many of the AA cadres who have no choice but to move towards Bangladesh and at the same time, many of the AA cadres moved deeper inside Myanmar territory. It is believed that with a certain amount of understanding with Bangladesh Army, Arakan Army set up their camps in Bandarban district, inside Bangladesh.

 From the beginning of 2020, there has been no report of activities of AA cadres inside Mizoram territory. Not only this, AA had ceased using Mizoram as a transit route as their nearest camp from the border is located at Moilewah village, under the command of self-style Colonel Moy Tum Kyaw with around 500 cadres, which is around 25 kilometers from the Mizoram-Myanmar border.

**Arakanese in Mizoram:**

****Along the Mizoram-Myanmar border areas, the following villages in Mizoram are predominantly inhabited by Arakanese (aka Rakhine) tribe - (i) Hmawngbuchhuah village (ii) Model village (iii) Zochachhuah village (iv) Kakichhuah village (v) Banduk Banga village. As more than half of the population of these villages are considered to be sympathizers of AA and their cause, it is evident that AA cadres can procure their requirements through or using these villagers without the need of entering Mizoram themselves.

**Conclusion:**

 It may be worth mentioning that AA cadres need not enter into Mizoram for their movement to Bangladesh as they can directly enter into Bangladesh from their camp at Moilewah village in an easier and safer manner.

 As for the prevention of movement of such international rebels within Mizoram, monitoring of the above mentioned Rakhine dominated villages by Mizoram police in close coordination with the Assam Rifles is essential so as to prevent AA cadres from utilizing the village and villagers.

 As far as the AA is concerned, one other point that may be put into consideration is the Kaladan Multi Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP). As this route is scheduled to pass through the operational areas of AA, demands have been previously made to the construction company by AA which has not been complied with till today. The said work was briefly halted during 2020 due to problems created by the AA and obstruction and even hampering of the progress of this KMMTTP cannot be ruled out in the coming days over non compliance to the demands of Arakan Army or in the absence of an agreement between the AA and the concern construction company.
