****AGENDA POINTS FOR THE NORTH EASTERN REGIONAL POLICE****

****CO-ORDINATION COMMITTEE (NERPCC) MEETING****

****OF THE DsGP OF NE STATES****

**1) INSURGENCY PROBLEM:**

**Insurgent groups operating in and around Mizoram in the recent years**

- After the signing of Mizo Peace Accord between the Government of India and MNF on 30th June, 1986 which ends two decades of insurgency in the state, Mizoram itself experiences low level of insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions.

- As of now Mizoram does not have any active insurgent group after some active insurgent group in the state surrendered to the state government. Some active insurgent group who had surrendered to the state government were HPC(D), Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) and Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM).

- HPC (D) was insurgent group from the northern parts of Mizoram and it signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018 with Government of Mizoram. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 13th April, 2018 where around 102 Cadres and 12 Council Members of HPC(D) came to over ground at the ceremony.

- As for the North-Western region, the Bru insurgency has been contained to a great extent so much so that this insurgent Group has become more or less a group of Bandits without any specific demands or objectives. Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF) which was formed in 1997 signed Peace Accord with Govt.of Mizoram on 26.4.2005 and surrendered to the Government on 25.7.2005 and 195 Cadres came over ground along with 9(nine) Weapons.

- Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram(BLFM) surrendered to the Government on 26.10.2006. About 804 Cadres came overground with 66(sixty six) weapons and 45(forty five) ammunitions.

- Presently, the Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) and Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) (Manipur based insurgent groups) are having permanent camp inside Myanmar adjacent to Mizoram. This matter needs to be discussed seriously with Myanmar government since the PLA and ZRA are imparting training to various underground outfit of the Northeast. It has also been ascertained that different Northeast insurgent groups like United National Liberation Front(UNLF), National Democratic Front of Bodo Land(NDFB), United Liberation Front of Assam(ULFA) and National Liberation Front of Tripura(NLFT) etc. occasionally have meetings inside Myanmar and used Mizoram as a conduit for illegal movements and activities. Alertness must be maintained regarding this matter.

**2) DRUG SMUGGLING PROBLEM:**

 Mizoram has a long international boundary with two countries (496.531 kms. with Myanmar and 319.791 kms. with Bangladesh) and 284 kms. of inter-state natural boundaries with three other states – Assam, Tripura and Manipur. Interestingly, Mizoram lies at the periphery of the Golden Triangle historically known for its drug manufacturing and trade. Mizoram has also always been a socio-cultural corridor because, historically as well as recently, populations ethnically related to the residents of the state reside in the neighbouring regions of both foreign countries and within India. This creates favourable conditions for economic and financial interactions both legal and illicit. It also makes it both a destination as well as transit point for various goods.

Among the narcotic drugs known/seized in Mizoram are substances such as Heroin, Opium, Ganja etc., while psychotropic substances include Amphetamine-Type Stimulants (ATS). Besides these, there are various synthetic drugs that are being abused and are causing socio-cultural problems among the youth.

In recent years there has been an alarming trend of smuggling of Pseudoephedrine from mainland India through Mizoram into Myanmar. The smuggled Pseudoephedrine is used for preparation of Methamphetamine in jungle labs in Myanmar. The finished products i.e. Methamhetamine tablets are then smuggled back into Mizoram from Myanmar for local consumption or further distribution in other states. Meanwhile, almost all Ganja seized by Drug law enforcement agencies in Mizoram have entered via Manipur.

**Trafficking Route:**Due to geographic and cultural proximity with the Golden Triangle region, drugs available in Golden Triangle are more or less also available in Mizoram from across the neighbouring country of Myanmar due to unfenced international boundary.

(i) Pharmaceutical Drugs, Marijuana (Ganja) which is most commonly abused are being smuggled into the state through neighbouring states. Pharmaceutical Drugs are smuggled mostly from Assamand Tripuraand Manipur in case of Marijuana (Ganja).

(ii) Precursor drugs such as Pseudo Ephedrine are smuggled to Myanmar through Mizoram from North India. The pre-cursor drug is manufactured as Amphetamine-Type Stimulants that is, Meth Amphetamine in simple laboratories at Myanmar. The seizure of large quantity of Meth Amphetamine by Mizoram Police during 2015 – 2020 (till date) manifest the fact that pre-cursor drugs viz. Pseudo-Ephedrine smuggled to Myanmar through Mizoram is manufactured as Meth-Amphetamine (a dangerous banned substance) across the border and pushed back into Mizoram. The reverse trend needs serious attention by Drugs Law Enforcing agencies.

**Details of seizure of drugs during the last 5 years (2015 - May, 2020) is enclosed as Annexure-I.**

**3) HUMAN TRAFFICKING ISSUE:**

 Human Trafficking is a worldwide Crime, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in its Anti Human Trafficking Project in partnership with Govt. of India Ministry of Home Affairs proposed to establish Anti-Human Trafficking Units in 50% districts in the country. As per the instruction of Govt. of India, four Anti-human Trafficking Units (AHTU) have been established in Aizawl District, Lunglei District, Champhai District and Kolasib District under Mizoram Police Department.

Action taken by Govt. of Mizoram and Mizoram Police Department in the field of Anti-Human Trafficking are as follows:

1. Superintendent of Police CID (Crime) was appointed as state Anti Human Trafficking Nodal Officer by Police Headquarters, Mizoram vide order No. CB/PHQ/C/307/ 2010/75 dt. 02/11/2010.
2. Police Headquarters order No. CB/PHQ/C/307/08/311 dt.12/07/2010 appointed all Addl. SP and Dy. SP as Anti-Human Trafficking Nodal Officers in their respective district.
3. Whenever information is received regarding Human Trafficking, the case will be taken up by Anti-Human Trafficking Unit(AHTU) Team set up at Aizawl, Lunglei, Champhai and Kolasib District along with representative of State Department and NGOs, within their respective jurisdictions under the supervision of concerned District Superintendent of Police and the Nodal Officer, Anti-Human Trafficking, Mizoram. However, in regards to remaining District where AHTUs are not set up viz. (Serchhip, Mamit, Lawngtlai,Siaha, Saitual, Khawzawl and Hnahthial), if such report is received, AHTU Team will be temporarily set up by the concerned District Superintendent of Police in consultation with the Nodal Officer, Anti-Human Trafficking, Mizoram and the Team so setup will take up the Human Trafficking cases.
4. Recently, Mizoram State has some inter-state Human Trafficking cases. The Investigating Officer/Senior Officer along with lady officer is usually dispatched to conduct rescue operation in such cases. Co-operation with NGOs is required for rescue and rehabilitation of trafficked victims and to have a successful combat against Human Trafficking.

_Recent Human Trafficking Case_:

On 21.4.2019, fourteen (14) Nepali women reached Zokhawthar trying to cross Indo-Myanmar border. However, they were prevented from crossing the border. All of them were taken to Aizawl and as per the direction of the hon’ble court they were temporarily kept at Protective Home. In the meantime, one BalBahadur, a Nepali citizen was apprehended by Bawngkawn Police Station on the evening of dt.23.4.2019 who is suspected to be involved in human trafficking of these Nepali women.

On the evening of 23.4.2019, CID Crime staff located seven(7) Nepalese women who were staying in Hotel Joy, Thuampui.On the evening of dt.24.4.2019, two Nepalese women were located by Vaivakawn Police Station at Hotel Green View, Phungchawng. They were shifted to Protective Home on the same night.

It is highly suspected that the mode of mass movement of Nepalese women into Mizoram and entering into Myanmar for seeking employment in Middle East Country and it might be a case of human trafficking. Most of them did not possess any valid documents. So, it is suspected that these Nepalese women are being recruited for the purpose of exploitation in various forms.

In this regard, FIR was submitted to Bawngkawn Police Station by DySP, CID(Crime) and Bawngkawn PS C/No 107/19 dt.24.4.2019 u/s 370(3), 468 IPC was registered.

During the year 2019 a good number of Rohingyas victims were rescued by Mizoram Police at Champhai and Aizawl. And arrested the persons involved in trafficking of Rohingyas. These traffickers used Maxi-Cab(Sumo) as the medium of transportation. Their movementwas controlled from Myanmar side through phone calls made to local Mizo Maxi Cab drivers with directions for pick up and dropping of Rohingyas. The investigation revealed that some locals were also involved in extending harboring and transporting of victims for financial gain with little knowledge of further movement of victims. All the Rohingyas detected in Mizoram were placed in Temporary Foreigner Detention Center, Vairengte, State Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Centre under Social Welfare Department, Aizawl and TNT, Thuampui as per orders of the Hon’ble Court and before deporting into their place of origin.In some cases the victims stated they were taken by deception while some victims state that they intend to go to Malaysia through Myanmar for better employment opportunities.

**4) INDO-MYANMAR BORDER ISSUE:**

Mizoram shared 496.531 Kms with Myanmar. The open unfenced border and the Free Movement Regime(FMR) between India and Myanmar allowMyanmaresenationals to enter up to 16 kmsinto Mizoram Territory without any Visa restrictions and this may facilitated unabated influx of foreigners, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities from Myanmar.While the FMR has helped the tribes continue to maintain their age old ties, it has also become a cause of concern for the security establishment as its provisions are exploited by the Indian insurgents to cross over to Myanmar unrestricted and establish safe havens. Another provision in the FMR, which allows tribal people to carry headload has also been misused to smuggle in drugs, weapons and other contraband.

Indian insurgents crossing the international border and hide in the neighbouring country is not new. Since the inception of insurgency in the Northeast in the 1950s, the Naga, Mizo, Meitei, and Assamese insurgents have been crossing over into Myanmar to set up bases, especially in the Chin state and Sagaing Region, where they rest, recoup, train, plan and launch future offences, and take shelter when pursued by the Indian security forces.In fact, the shelter and support that the Indian insurgent groups receive from across the border have been one of the most important factors which has helped them in sustaining their rebellion even when faced with the superior might of the Indian security forces.

Besides cross border movement of insurgents, rampant armed smuggling and drug trafficking are other significant security challenges emanating across the India-Myanmar border. The Indian insurgent groups have been procuring arms from the black markets of Southeast Asia as well as fromMyanmar-based rebel groups. While the bulk of the weapons from Thailand and Cambodia are smuggled through the sea route, some of them are also smuggled overland through the India-Myanmar border with the help of Chin and Arakanese insurgents. These weapons are often brought in as headloads by the insurgents as well as the local villagers.Weapons produced in Chinaare also routed across the Myanmar border at Ruili and then trucked via Lashio, Mandalay and Monywa toenter the Indian borderthrough Phek, Chandel, Churachandpur and Champhai.

Proximity to Myanmar in the ‘Golden Triangle’ makes the India-Myanmar border vulnerable to trafficking of heroin and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) produced in Myanmar. These narcotics are trafficked into India through the states of Mizoram, Manipur, and Nagaland from Bhamo, Lashio and Mandalay.

Hundreds of refugees streamed into Mizoram following clashes between the Myanmar Army (MA) and the Arakan Army (AA) in the year 2017. The same case may happen again due to major attack of Myanmar Army (MA) by Arakan Army (AA) and also if the Myanmar Army (MA) launches any major operation there may be influx of refugees/AA into Mizoram. After completion of the KMMTTP there may be unabated influx of foreigner into Mizoram due to Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar.

There may be increase in cross border crimes due to better road connectivity after completion of KMMTTP. This may open door for illegal activities such as Arms Smuggling, Human Trafficking, Drugs Smuggling and illegal migration of foreigners due to the very strategic location of Mizoram. It would be necessary to beef up the security along Myanmar and Mizoram border in order to restrain cross border crime once the project is completed.

1. **INTER-STATE BORDER ISSUES:**

Mizoram is one of the eight states in the North-East of India. Mizoram shares its borders with other north-eastern states of Manipur, Tripura and Assam.Mizoram shares a 123-km border with southern Assam and has been claiming a 509-square mile stretch “occupied” by the neighbouring State. Mizoram used to be the Lushai Hills district of Assam before being made a Union Territory in 1972 and a State in 1987.

The border dispute between Mizoram and Assam is a long-pending issue which remains unresolved till date. The three Mizoram districts of Kolasib, Aizawl and Mamit share about 123 km long border with south Assam’s Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts. While Mizoram claimed that a 509 square-mile stretch of the inner-line reserve forest notified in 1875 under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873 belongs to Mizoram, Assam side uphold the constitutional map and boundary drawn by survey of India in 1993.

The border issue has remained relatively calm despite its disputed nature, except a few instances in 1994, 2007 and 2018 when tensions flared up. Clashes began as Mizoram raised the issue of Assamese encroachment, while Assam protested it. The Assam forest department was seen building houses and clearing forests in areas considered Mizoram territory. Armed confrontation between police of both the states was averted by the intervention of the Union Home Ministry. Mizoram does not accept the present boundary with Assam and suggests that the Inner Line Reserved Forest, as described in the 1875 notification under the East Bengal Frontier Regulation of 1873, should be the basis of delineating the border.

The last border stand-off took place in March 2018 at Zophai or Karchurthal area near Bairabi town along the Mizoram-Assam border when state’s apex student organization MizoZirlai Pawl (MZP) functionaries attempted to construct a wooden resting shed there. More than 60 people were allegedly injured when Assam police resorted to lathi charge to disperse the protesting students. The border dispute, however, was put under control with the intervention of the Centre, which asked both the Mizoram and Assam to maintain status quo till issues are resolved. The joint action committee was formed by both the governments of Mizoram and Assam under Union Ministry of Home Affairs in April 2018.

Representatives of the Young Mizo Association (YMA), MizoZirlai Pawl (MZP), MizoUpa Pawl and the Joint Action Committee for Boundary Dispute had submitted a memorandum to the prime minister, requesting the establishment of a Boundary Commission to solve the issue.

The Mizoram government is making massive effort to resolve the long pending state border dispute with neighbouring Assam. The State Government has sent a letter to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs asking it to review the Mizoram-Assam boundary based on the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873 and the Inner Line of the Lushai Hills Notification, 1993.The core committee, headed by Chief Secretary LalnunmawiaChuaungo was formed in May 2019 and the committeehas collected important documents related to the boundary and some student bodies were also involved in the committee.Mizoram Cabinet had in July 2019 declared that the inner-line reserve forest area belonged to Mizoram and is the actual boundary of the State.

The apex student body MZP also constantly demanding the state government to immediate resolve the border dispute.

1. **Inter-State Cooperation in Investigation of cases**:

There were many instances where police from other state need to arrest people from another state. Coordination between the two states is much required in these cases especially in arresting the accused. Some common cases which normally required inter-state cooperation are human trafficking cases, vehicle theft cases, drugs and armed smuggling cases etc.

1. **Need to enhance capacity building for the training institutes in the north eastern states:**

Training is crucial for organizational development and success. Especially in law enforcement new recruits are given basic training before assigning normal duty. Due to advancement in technology, amendment of laws, rules, Act, new modus operandi of crime,continuous or regular training is much required in order keep personnel updated to handle the new challenges. Our training institutions need to be enhanced on order to cope with the new challenges.

1. **Interstate Covid-19 Management/Coordination**:

Indian migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced multiple hardships. With factories and workplaces shut down due to the lockdown imposed in the country, millions of migrant workers had to deal with the loss of income, food shortages and uncertainty about their future.Following this, many of them and their families went hungry. Thousands of them then began walking back home, with no means of transport due to the lockdown. In response, the Central and State Governments took various measures to help them, and later arranged transport for them.

There are an estimated 139 million migrants in the country, according to the World Economic Forum. Migrant workers majorly comprise of daily-wage labourers working in the manufacturing and construction industries. They are often denied adequate healthcare, nutrition, housing and sanitation, since many of them work in the informal sector. They are mostly from rural areas but live in cities for work for most of the year. Many have no savings and lived in factory dormitories, which were shut due to the lockdown. Inter-state Covid-19 management coordination is required in order to handle effectively of this pandemic.

1. **Inter-state migrant movement**:

Due to enforcement of nationwide lockdown since March, 2020 by Ministry of Home Affairs, government of India, thousands of migrants’ workers loss their job and thousands returned to their home state. Due to shut down of commercial vehicles, Airlines, Trains, thousands of migrant workers faced problems in returning to their home state. In Mizoram a Task Group on Migrant Workers and Stranded Travellers was constituted to deal with migrants’ workers and Mizoram residents, who stranded in different parts of the country as well as the world. A website tankhang.Mizoram.gov.in was launched where all stranded Mizos can report it to the state government. The movement plan of stranded migrant workers and Mizoram resident those who are willing to return was taken care by Task Group on Migrant Workers and Stranded Travellers

1. **Inter-state transportation of goods movement**:

Many states in the north eastern state are importing essential goods from other state. Due to imposition of nation-wide lockdown trucks/vehicles carrying essential goods were facing problems and this need to be looked into. In Mizoram, a task group on Commodities was constituted to take care of movement of commodities within and outside the state.

1. **Inter-state movement of people by private/government vehicles**:

Many state governments made arrangement for hiring bus/commercial vehicle for bringing back stranded persons and some individuals who afford to hire vehicles or having private vehicles also going back to their home state, in dealing with as the stranded persons have to cross many states on their way home, inter-state coordination in this regard is much required.
