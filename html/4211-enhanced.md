Subject : Clarification of extracts of DSI dated 4th December 2024 - reg.

Sir

 Please refer to your letter No.DIG(NR)/CR-2A/2024/1271 Dt.05.12.2024 regarding extracts of DSI dated 4th December 2024, clarification for the required extract is as follows:

PART III : COMMUNAL/TRIBAL AFFAIRS/NGO:

The Zo-Indigenous ID card features logos with "UN" at the top left and "ZoRO" at the top right. Below these logos, it states 'ZO INDIGENOUS,' followed by the affiliation statement: ‘Affiliated with United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) No-1236524 Dated 21 May 2004'. The ID numbers are categorized as IPI (Indigenous Peoples of India), IPM (Myanmar), and IPB (Bangladesh). Beneath the cardholder's name and identification, there is a certification printed: ‘This card certifies Indigenous Identity in accordance with United Nations Declarations on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2007 (UNDRIP)'.

According to ZORO, the purpose and utility of the Zo-Indigenous ID Card are to foster indigenous unity and uphold the rights of the Zo Tribes. The card is designed to help the Zo Indigenous people maintain and develop connections, relationships, and collaboration across borders. It also aims to preserve the identity, culture, and traditions of the Zo people and enforce the rights of indigenous peoples as declared by the United Nations. This identity card serves as official proof of identity for the Zo Indigenous people, acknowledging their unique cultural heritage and traditions. It promotes unity and solidarity among the Zo people, transcending national borders and geographical boundaries.

Yours faithfully
