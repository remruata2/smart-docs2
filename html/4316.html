In 1972 it became a centrally administered union territory under the name of Mizoram, and in 1987 it achieved statehood. It has an area of 8,139 square miles (21,081 square km) and a population of 1,091,014as per 2011 census.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where around 102 (one hundred two) Cadres and 12 (twelve) Council Members of HPC(D) came to over ground at the ceremony. However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by LalhmingthangaSanate have started resurfacing and planning to reorganise themselves which could, in due course of time, pose security problems especially in the northern most and north eastern parts of Mizoram.</span></span></span></span></p>

Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF) which was formed in 1997 signed Peace Accord with Govt.of Mizoram on 26.4.2005 and surrendered to the Government on 25.7.2005 and 195 (one hundred ninety five) Cadres came over ground along with 9 (nine)weapons.

Assam Rifles, Border Security Force and Central Reserve Police Force. Mizoram Police deployed Mizoram Armed Police (MAP)/Indian Reserve Battalionmainly along interstate borders by setting up Border OutPosts (BOPs).&nbsp; 3 (three) Battalions of Assam Rifles(AR) manned the Indo-Myanmar border in the East and South while 3 (three) Battalions of Border Security Force(BSF) manned the Western border with limited man-power which leaves many areas vulnerable to infiltration. The porous international borders served as a possible route for Insurgent Groups to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, trafficking of human etc. across the borders of Mizoram. Influx of illegal foreigners from Bangladesh and Myanmar into Mizoram could also create deeper problems.</span></span></span></span></p>

Many instances of seizure of some arms and contraband items within the state during the past years indicate use of the state as a trafficking route of the contraband items. However, it could also boldly be said that arms trafficking has been successfully checked during the last two years.</span></span></span></span></p>
