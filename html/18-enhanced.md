****Inspr. TIALTHAWNGA OF 3rd Bn. MAP****

 My particulars given above is correct I was posted at 3rd Bn. MAP from September 2008 and posted as Adjutant.

 On 22nd April 2009, I was staying late at my office due to pressing works and went home late. After dinner, while I was resting in my home, at around 7:00 – 8:00 PM, I was called by ADM (I) Biaknunsanga through telephone informing me about the incident that while Inspr. Tialthawnga and C/- Biakzauva had an altercation about the purchase of motorcycle, one Hav. Lalengmawia of training branch had interfered and because of this Inspr. Tialthawnga hit or push Hav. Lalengmawia who fell to the ground and became unconscious. The Havildar was brought to Bn. MI for medical treatment but the medical staff, after seeing the gravity of his injury referred him to Civil Hospital. Then I went down to ADM (I) office and I asked about the details of the incident, and I was informed about the reported incidents. I informed this incident to my superior officers and I sent someone to call Inspr. Tialthawnga. But they came back without the officer saying that he was not at home and were told by his relatives that he (Tialthawnga) came home earlier but quickly went out again and did not know where he had gone. I instructed my men to lookout for him. Then I went to the place of incident which is in between Trainers’ Barrack and temporary bathrooms.

 After this, we stayed at the ADM (I) office and later came to know that Inspr. Tialthawnga had come home. Then I sent someone to call him. Inspr. Tialthawnga arrived and I asked him about the incident. He (Tialthawnga) replied that he did not clearly know what happened, but as things happened, he have to bear the responsibilities. We held a discussion among the officers present and we felt necessary to medically examine Inspr. Tialthawnga and I filled up and signed the medical requisition form and sent the office to Civil Hospital, Aizawl for medical examination to ascertain whether he consume alcohol or not. He was escorted by SI H. Lalrinsanga and some Jawans. I also informed Aizawl PS about this as I was asked earlier about the whereabout of Inspr. Tialthawnga. During this period our officers who escorted the injured Hav. Lalengmawia to the Hospital reported that he (Lalengmawia) was still unconscious. After this, as there was nothing much to do, we dispersed and I went home. I was informed about the death of Hav. Lalengmawia, immediately after his death and made necessary preparations for his burial. I have nothing more to say.
