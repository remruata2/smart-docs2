****COLLECTIVE APPROACH TO RESOLVE INSURGENCY****

****IN NORTH EAST REGION****

The North East region of India comprising of eight states –Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Tripura and Sikkim. North East India isa region poorly connected to the Indian mainland by a small corridor – Silghuri Corridor (also known as Chicken Neck – with a narrow width of only 23 kilometres).North Eastern India has been facing problems of insurgency for near 5 decades, but things are now settling down and peace started to prevail.

****What is insurgency?****

An insurgency is an armed rebellion against a constituted authority when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents. Incase of Indian scenario it can be seen as armed rebellion and violent protests against Indian Government or authority.

****Insurgency in North East India****

Nagaland, Manipur, Assam and Tripura had been witnessing conflict since 1950-1960, but since 1990, the intensity of conflicts started to decrease. Now the only state where prominent insurgency exists is Manipur. But in this region several armed factions operate. Some groups call for a separate state, others for regional autonomy while some extreme groups demand complete independence.

****Reasons for conflict in North East India:****

- Historical reasons – loosely administered under British India.
- Cultural differences.
- Tensions between tribal people, who are natives of these states, and migrant  peoples from other parts ofIndia.
- Geographical reasons – not well connected with present Indian mainland.
- Developmental reasons – Poorly developed due to lack of fund from  Center/States.
- Environmental reasons.
- Military reasons –AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Power Act).
- Political difference of mainland India.
- External support – China and Myanmar.

****Recent Observations about North East India****

****Insurgency & Ceasefire****

1. The basic ingredient of insurgency i.e. popular support is drying up in the  region. Insurgency is active only in Manipur. There are around 50 insurgent  groups in Manipur.
2. Ceasefire and Suspension of Operations with militant groups allows them to  indulge in extortion and kidnapping, which in turn help them in maintaining  their clout over the people of the region.
3. There exists deep nexus between all the insurgent groups in the Northeast. The  CPI (Maoist) is also in touch with the North east insurgents primarily to source  weapons. Arms were given by the United Liberation Force of Assam (ULFA)  to the CPI (Maoist) in West Bengal.
4. The biggest challenge to the North East is extortion carried out by various  insurgent groups. Extortion has become meticulously organised activity in the  region and is one of the major sources of funds for the militants.

****Political****

1. It is important to understand the culture and psyche of the people of North East  while framing policy alternatives.
2. The perceived threat to the political identity of the Assamese people from the  illegal migrants from Bangladesh lies at the core of the Assam problem. The  indigenous people of Assam feel that in future the illegal migrants will become  the majority population and they will lose political power.
3. The ceasefire agreements and peace negotiations have resulted in reducing the  violence levels and given the civil societies of the region space to talk.
4. One of the ways to contain insurgency in the region is to delegate powers to the  ethnic minorities through the Autonomous District Councils so that they can  fashion their own development.
5. The implementation of Sixth Schedule in Assam has not benefited the tribal  communities of the state. Following the 73rd and 74th amendments, the Central  and state governments are providing huge amounts of financial resources to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) and municipalities. Since, the scheduled areas  do not fall under the purview of the PRI and municipalities, they do not receive  any share of these funds and as a result they lose out.

****Development****

1. Security situation in the region has improved considerably in Assam and  Meghalaya in particular facilitating conducive atmosphere for investment and  development. The Northeast Industrial Policy initiated by the Government of  India further contributed in encouraging investment and industries in the  region.
2. However, the Northeast will not attract big industries because the region is  resource deficit, and does not have economies of scale to match. Moreover, the  security situation in the whole of the region has not improved uniformly.
3. The North East Council (NEC) and the Ministry for the Development of the  North East Region (DoNER) have become fund disbursing agencies instead of  strategic planning agencies. At present approximately Rs. 11,000 crore is lying  idle with the Ministry of DoNER.

****Look East Policy****

1. The North East still remains inward looking focussing primarily on internal  conflicts. There is no discussion on the benefits that could accrue to the region  from the Look East Policy.
2. If the North East Region is opened up there is a fear of being swamped by  cheap Chinese goods, which would spell disaster for the local manufacturing  units.
3. Apprehensions exist that the development of communication links could result  in developing strong links between the people of the North east with the people  of China, Myanmar and ASEAN countries, which would undermine the unity  and integrity of India.

****Border issues****

1. The international borders in the North east are extremely porous. Thus, cross  border infiltration of militants, and smuggling of arms are rampant in the  region.
2. China has differing claim in Arunachal Pradesh. Along the westernmost corner,  Chinese claim line lay 20 kms. south and in the eastern most extreme of  Arunachal Pradesh it lay 30 kms. south.
3. International boundaries in the North East have not crystallised into lines  separating sovereign countries on the ground.

****Recommendations to solve North East India Problems****

****Insurgency****

1. Thorough background check of all insurgents groups should be carried out  before the central government enters into any Ceasefire or Suspension of  Operations Agreements with the insurgents.

****Political****

1. Political solutions to the Assam problem should be discussed openly as widely  as possible to avoid backlash from the tribal and the minority population of the  state.
2. A system of work permit should be issued so that the illegal Bangladeshi  migrants do not end up as Indian citizens.
3. Governance should be improved in a step by step manner. Strict supervision by  senior officials should be initiated to improve the delivery system of the  government.

****Development****

1. The Ministry of the Development of the North East region (DoNER) be merged  with the North East Council (NEC) for better strategic planning and  coordination of various developmental projects in the region.
2. Focus of the Ministry of DoNER and NEC should be on investment in mega- projects which will make big difference to the development of the region.
3. Institutional capacities in the North east should be developed urgently.
4. Pragmatic land use policy should be formulated for attracting industries in the  region. Micro, small and medium enterprises should be encouraged.
5. Local tourism should be promoted. Tourists residing in the eight North Eastern  states should be encouraged to travel within the region.
6. Niche tourism or high end tourism should be encouraged. Medical and higher  education tourism should be encouraged.
7. The North east should become a single economic unit without disturbing the political boundaries of the states. No internal traffic barriers in the region.  Exclusive five year plan for the North east focusing on development of  infrastructure.

****Look East Policy****

1. Greater awareness about the Look East Policy and its benefits to the North East  should be generated among the policymakers and the intelligentsia of the region.
2. Ties with Myanmar should be deepened by exploiting Myanmar’s anxieties  about China as well as existing deep civilization and spiritual ties.
3. The North East region must be included in the India-ASEAN Vision for trade  and cooperation. Development Plan for the North East should factor India- ASEAN strategic cooperation.
4. Integrated and bottoms up approaches are required for integration of the North  east in the Look East Policy. The North East should formulate plans as to how  it can engage with the ASEAN. Better coordination of efforts by all the North  Eastern states should be ensured.
5. Visa offices of Bangladesh and Myanmar should be located in the North East.
6. Centres/Departments for the studies of neighbouring countries like Myanmar,  Bangladesh, Tibet, Bhutan and Nepal in Universities should be set up in  universities to understand India’s neighbours better.

****Border issues****

1. Special economic zones along India-Bangladesh border, especially in Meghalaya and Assam should be set up.
2. States should focus more on the development and security of the border areas.
3. Sentiments of the people of Arunachal Pradesh should be taken into  consideration by the central government while discussing the frameworks for  resolution of the border dispute with China.
4. Matching infrastructure and military capability should be build to ensure peace  and enable negotiations from a position of strength.

****INTERNAL SECURITY WITH FOCUS ON INTELLIGENCE SHARING AND CO-ORDINATION FOR COMBATING TERRORISM/INSURGENCY AND POLICE REFORMS.****

****I.****Overview of State Security********

The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful. Although peaceful, Mizoram is surrounded by countries and states which are having many disturbances with respect to insurgency and terrorism.

 Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (The insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to the over two-decades armed conflict of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where around 104 Cadres and 12 Council Members of HPC(D) come to over ground at the ceremony.

 As for the North-Western region, the Bru insurgency has been contained to a great extend so much so that this insurgent Group has become more or less a group of Bandits without any definite demand or objectives.

**II. Intelligence sharing and co-ordination for combating terrorism/insurgency :**

A robust mechanism for intelligence sharing among the various States and Central agencies is in place in the country. The coordination mechanism for intelligence sharing at state–level that presently exist in Mizoram is highlighted as under:

**(a) Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC):**

Subsidiary Multi Agency Centre (SMAC) was set up in Mizoram Police during May, 2011. It is one of the Centres amongst various Intelligence Agencies under Ministry of Home Affairs for effective sharing of intelligence input/report with other Central and State Agencies. Regular SMAC meetings of Nodal Officers of the State police, security forces, paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies deployed within the State of Mizoram are being conducted regularly at SIB Hqrs., Aizawl. During such meetings, intelligence inputs are shared and discussed with responders/State Police and often Law Enforcement Agencies for necessary follow up action.

The following nodal officers or their representatives regularly attended SMAC Meeting conducted by SIB, Aizawl under the supervision of Additional Deputy Director, SIB, Aizawl.

(i)  DIG (N/R), Mizoram Police, Aizawl

(ii) DIG, 23 Sector Hqrs., Assam Rifles

(iii) DIG, BSF Sector Hqrs., Aizawl

(iv)  Deputy Commissioner, Special Bureau, Aizawl

(v) Commandant, 46 Bn. Assam Rifles, Aizawl

(iv) Commandant, CRPF, 225 Bn. Hqrs, Aizawl

(vii) SP, CID (SB), Aizawl

(viii) SP, Security, Aizawl

(ix) SP, Crime, Aizawl

(x) SP, Aizawl

(xi) OC, 237, IFSU, Aizawl

(xii) Deputy Commandant, BSF (G Branch), Sector Hqrs., Aizawl

(xiii) OC, No.1, CT/IS-DET, ECCIU, Aizawl

In addition to SMAC Meeting, Intelligence inputs are being shared with various intelligence agencies all over India through Multi Agency Centre (MAC) Threat Management System.

**Suggestion to improve the System of SMAC in Mizoram:** 

Real time sharing of intelligence inputs through Threat Management System (TMS) with other intelligence agencies is hampered due to frequent disruption of connectivity (intranet) of the system. It is therefore suggested that suitable measures may be taken to plug such loophole.

**(b) Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA) Coordination/ Directional Meeting:**

Assam Rifle and Border Security Force (BSF) have regularly conducted LIA Coordination Meeting in Aizawl. LIA Directional Meeting is also regularly conducted by BSF in Silchar, Assam. During such meetings, intelligence inputs are shared and discussed with responders/State Police and often Law Enforcement Agencies for necessary follow up action. The LIA Coordination meeting is held under the chairmanship of DIG, 23rd Assam Rifle if LIA is conducted by Assam Rifle and DIG, Sector HQ BSF presided over the meeting if it was conducted by BSF.

In LIA Coordination Meeting held in Aizawl, Nodal Officers / or their representatives from the following Central and State agencies deployed within the state of Mizoram normally attended the meetings.

(i) SIB, Aizawl

(ii)  Deputy Commissioner, SB (GOI), Aizawl

(iii) OC 2/237 IFSU

(iv) 2/1 CT/IS Det, ECCIU

(v) SP CID (SB), Aizawl

(ix) Director of Intelligence Revenue,Aizawl,

(x) SP Aizawl, Kolasib, Mamit, Champhai, Serchhip, Lunglei, Lawngtlai,  Saiha

**II. Police reforms :**

 

 The police are the first responders in the event of any terrorist attack or violence, and they are also the backbone of our intelligence, investigation and anti-corruption agencies. Thus, from the point of any angle - the security of the common man, the survival of democracy, maintaining the trajectory of economic progress or dealing with the major threats confronting the country - we have to have a reformed, restructured and revitalised police force.

There have been a number of commissions, both at the State and Central level - State Police Commissions, National Police Commission, Gore Committee, Ribeiro Committee, Padmanabhaiah Committee, Malimath Committee, to name only a few - which made recommendations for reforms, but received no more than cosmetic treatment at the hands of the government.

It is imperative to strengthen the manpower of Mizoram Police by filling up vacant posts by way of fresh recruitment at various ranks and files.

**III. Case for reimbursement of Security Related Expenditure :**

Mizoram is having approximately 404 kms and 318 kms porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively. There are 3 (three) Battalions of Assam Rifles deployed at the Indo-Myanmar border and 3 (three) Battalions of BSF deployed along Indo-Bangladesh border. In addition, Mizoram Police has separately deployed security personnel (IR Bn) along Indo-Bangla border and the expenditure incurred for performing such security duties were boned by the state government. The porous international borders served as an important route for IGs to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, etc across the borders of Mizoram.

 It is therefore suggested that some discretionary component may be introduced under Security Related Expenditure (SRE) by Central Government so that states of Mizoram could acts as effective layer behind Central Paramilitary Forces for safeguarding the territory of India.
