 The above are my particulars. I was born and brought up at Baherchar Village in Narsingdi District of Bangladesh and I was born in the year 1993, 5th January. I started my education in a Madrasa in my native village when I was around 10/11 years old, and studied for 4 years. After that, I studied at a Madrasa in ShekharcharJamia Madrasa, Shekharchar for another 6 years and completed Maulavi course. After leaving the Madrasa at Shakharchar, I went to Bhairab town,Kishoreganj District, Bangladesh and rented a house in the market area for 1800Taka per month and started my own business as a Hawker selling popcorn and chips for around 8/9 months.

 After spending my term as a Hawker, I worked as a cement helper on a daily basis and whenever I could find work. It wasduring this time I met one person with the name of Munir from Cumilla,Cumilla District who was a head Mason( He is about 30 yrs,5.6’’,thin built, face oval and keeps short beard and moustache). I started working under Munir for about 7/8 months, In September ,2018he told me that if I wanted to go to India, he would help me in preparing a fake Aadhar Card for my entry into India. Eventually, I agreed to go into India and Munir gave me training on the use of Protected Text (PT) and the ways of sending secret text messages through it, and Munir got me prepared a fake Aadhar Card _(forged Indian Adhaar Card No.958333455376 in the name of Shariful Islam S/o Shafiqul Islam, Anandpur, Boxanagar, West Tripura)_

 Then on 14th Oct’ 2018,Munir gave me Rs. 25,000/- and as instructed by Munir I left Bhairab town for Akhaura,Brahmanbaria District, Bangladesh by train where I was previously told by Munir that I would met with one person named Harun of Dhaka,Bangladesh (He is about 30 yrs, 5’3”, ) who would accompany me all the way to India. From Akhaura, I left for Kasba along with Harun in an Auto. At, Kasba, we met with Hasem(Dalal), who helped us in crossing the border between the Bangladesh and India. Then on **15th Oct’2018**, at around 1:00 Pm in the afternoon we crossed into India evading BDR and BSF duty personnel. Upon reaching into India at Boxanagar, Tripura, we went into the house of Hasem’s (Dalal) uncle who arranged Auto for us to Bishalgarh for Rs. 700/-, and then by Bus to Agartala.

 At Agartala, we rented a house at Battala area of Agartala in the house of one Shahin (40/45 years) and stayed for 15 days along with Harun. This house of Shahin was already pre arranged by my handler Munir. During our stay at Agartala, Harun and I worked as Tile laying helper for 15 days.

I was instructed by Munir through Protected Text (PT) to change my location to Bengaluru. So, during the first week of **November, 2018**, I left Agartala for Guwahati by train and was given Rs. 10,000/- by Harun for my journey.

 On reaching Bengaluru, as instructed by Munir, I took a rented house at Bagalur, a small village on the outskirt of Bengaluru at Rs. 3000/- per month and stayed there for 4 months. During my stayed atBagalur, I took jobs wherever I could find work.

** After my stay at Bagalur, I asked Munir if I could change my location near to the city area to which he agreed, so I changed my place to Chikkabanavara, in North Bengaluru, and I stayed at Paradise Boys PG for Rs.5000/- per month for around 4 months (from March 2019), till 17th July, 2019 my leaving of Bengaluru for Tripura. My roommate at the PG was Farhan, from West Bengal, who was working as a supervisor in construction of buildings. While I was staying at the PG Hostel, I was given one memory card (16 GB) (containing data relating to Islamic indoctrination, explosive making, sketch making, instruction for recce,etc) by **Abdul Wadud**( 30 yrs, strong built, dark complex, 5’7”). Munirhad also instructed me through protected text to study the materials.**

During my stay at Bengaluru, I worked as Mason helper wherever I could find and I reported my daily schedule to Munir through Protected Text. Harun also told me to find jobs and to go through the city also and I visited in Bengaluru places like Majestic Bus Station, Yeswantpur Train and Bus station, Muslim Area of Shivaji Nagar, etc. Munir also asked me through Protected Text to make a map of Bengaluru, which I tried and bought papers for it but could not make it.

During my stayed at Bengaluru, I received money from Munir 3 times through one person named Abdul Wadudin the amount of Rs.33,000/-, 14,000 and 11,000 respectively. I was also instructed by Munir to deposit Rs. 10,500/- in the account of one HazeraBibi, whose account number was given to me by Munir through PT. I deposited the money from a Bank (name not known) at Yeswanthpur, and reported it to Munir who immediately deleted the account number from the Protected Message.

 On 17th July’ 2019, I left Bengaluru for Guwahati by train (Guwahati Express) I bought the ticket myself in the name of Shariful Islam. I reached Guwahati in the morning of 20/7/2019 and stayed in theTrain station for two days, then on the morning of 22/7/2019@ 4:00 am, I left Guwahati for Dharmanagar (Kanchenjunga Express) and reached Dharmanagar at around 4 in the evening, and was picked up in the station by Mohammad SayadHussain who took me to his place at Kanchanpur, Tripura.

 On 25th July, 2019, I along with Mohammad Hussain left Kanchanpur for Mizoram to do recce on the areas bordering Bangladesh. We reached Rajiv Nagar, Mamit District, Mizoram and stayed the night at Tourist Lodge. The next day we proceeded towards Silsuri by boat and we spent the night at the house of the boatmans son-in-law along with the boatman. Then the next day dated 27th July, we went to Marpara by boat (BiplapChakma’s boat), and here we came to know of the need of ILP by non- residents of Mizoram, so we returned to Silsuri the same day, but we were caught by the locals who alerted the BSF because of suspicion. We stayed with the BSF for one night interrogated by them and then they handed us over to the Police at Marpara Police Station on the29th July, 2019.

I have one protectedtext user ID( i._e mixser34$_ with password –_mirinda99%_ ) with my handler Munir through which we made all secret communications.
