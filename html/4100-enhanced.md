****2. (iv) Development on KCNA and BD SFs operations in Bandarband (BD) and illegal entry of Bawm community in Mizoram**(Reported period from 29th March to 24th May 2024)**

 After a series of peace talks between representatives of KCNA and Bangladesh Government were conducted, the next round of talks was scheduled to be held on 22.4.2024. However, the bank robberies of Bandarban Districts of Bangladesh conducted by KCNA on 2.4.2024 have put all the efforts of the peace talks in question.

**Brief notes on the bank robberies :**

 On 2nd April, 2024 at around 9:30 p.m. of Bangladesh Time (BDT), around 25 (twenty five) armed cadres of Kuki-Chin National Army/ Kuki-Chin National Front (KNA/KNF) robbed Sonali Bank (one of the leading banks in Bangladesh) of Ruma Branch, Bandarban, Bangladesh. They looted about Takka 1 crore 58 lakhs from the bank taking more than an hour to complete the robbery.

 It is further learnt that 2 hours after the robbery, a gunfight took place between the cadres of KNA/KNF and Bangladesh Army at Khamtam Para of Rowangchari Upazila at 11:30 pm (BDT). In the incident, one Bangladesh Army soldier, Shafiqul Islam (25) received bullet injuries.

 

 Inputs also stated that on 3rd April 2024 at around 12:08 p.m. (BDT), Sonali Bank and Krishi Bank of Thanchi Branches, Bandarban District were also robbed by a group 25 (twenty five) armed cadres of KNA/KNF and reportedly looted Takka-17 lakhs 50 thousand from the two banks (Tk. 15 lakh from Sonali Bank and Tk. 2 lakh 50 thousand from Krishi Bank).

 There are no reports of injuries sustained by the KNA/KNF cadres in the incidents while few bank security personnel, Ansar personnel and police constables are reported to have sustained minor injuries.

 Consequent upon these incidents, the Peace Establishment Committee on 3rd April, 2024 expressed its strong condemnation against the bank robberies carried out by the suspected KNA/KNF cadres.

 S/S Colonel Solomon, Chief of Media and Intelligence Wing, Kuki-Chin National Front (KNF) in his supposedly justification of the incidents claimed that neither the Peace Establishment Committee or the Bangladesh Government is taking the demands of the KNF seriously and alleged the Bangladesh Government of not fulfilling any terms of the meeting.

**Aftermath of the bank robberies:**

1.  As a result of a gunfight between Bangladesh army and KNA/KCNA/KNF on 15.4.24 at Ruangchari, Banderban district, 7 Bangladesh army personnel were killed with 20 of them sustaining injuries. Meanwhile, Bangladesh army were also alleged to have kidnapped one married couple with their child on 22.4.2024 from Ruma village.

2. During an operation conducted at around Baktlai village ,Thanchi Sub-District (Bawm inhabited village) on 27.4.2024, Bangladesh Army killed 2 KCNA cadres and arrested another 2 KCNA members.

3. On 02.05.2024, there was another encounter between KCNA and Bangladesh Army in an area around Pankhiang village which resulted in the killing of 1 (one) Bangladesh Army personnel while another five of them sustained injuries. The injured personnel were later evacuated to Dhaka from Ruangsuri. There has been no reports of any casualties from KNA side as a result of this encounter.

4. Because of the frequent gun fights between KCNA and Bangladesh Army after the bank robberies carried out by KCNA, Bangladesh Army often abused the civilian living in various Bawm villages. So far, on suspicious grounds, they have arrested more than 80 civilians including Pastor Lalliansiama, Evangelical Christian Church of bethel village and Upa Lalnunnuama, ECCI of Hmunlai village. The total numbers of civilian arrested from 2023 have crossed more than 130 persons, out of which more than 30 of them are females.

5. On 03.05.2024, Bangladesh Army rounded up civilians from Pankhian village and shot dead 5 persons who were accused of being KNA members -

 a) Lalchawisang

 b) Peter, Khabai village

 c) Ramchhawn

 d) Lalremsang

 e) Vanlalthuai

6. To conduct massive combing operations, large numbers of Bangladesh Army entered Ruamsuri from Banderban. Scaring these army manoeuvres, civilians of these areas are fleeing towards the jungles and were sometimes pursued by the army. As a result of these, the following villagers are likely to enter Mizoram for their safety :

 a) Hmunnuam village

 b) Rathan village

 c) Basaltlang village

 d) Happy village

 e) Mualpui village

7. Bangladesh government had insisted on KCNA to returned the weapons they had seized from Bangladesh police during their bank robberies - 14 nos. Chinese Rifles, 2 nos. of AK rifles and 4 nos. of shotguns. KCNA had not, till now (20.5.24) complied to the demands. In a statement issued on 15.5.2024, KNF/KCNA stated their willingness to return the captured weapons if innocent civilians/KNF members imprisoned by Bangladesh government are release and with the resumption of peace talks by forming 'Peace talk committee' under the Ministry of Home Affairs.

8. Because of their sufferings, leaders of Bawm communities in Bangladesh greatly wish for the return of these weapons to the Bangladesh army. Moreover, it seemed that the support of KCNA by the local population has started to decrease slowly from recent days.

9. Latest input indicated that leaders of Bangladesh Bawm community -Pu Lalzumliana and Loyal David arrived at Aizawl on 01.05.2024 to have a meeting with leaders of Mizoram NGOs and the Chief Minister himself, if possible. These Bawm leaders wanted the NGO leaders and government officials of Mizoram to try to convince KCNA leaders to find an amicable solution with Bangladesh government if they (the KCNA leaders) enter inside Mizoram. It was also reported that, they met Pu Zoramthanga, MNF party President on 03.05.2024 at Mizor Hnam Run, Aizawl (MNF party office).

10. Information received stated that a large numbers of Bawm community who are Bangladesh Nationals seek refuge inside Mizoram and entered Chamdur Project Village, Lawngtlai District on 10.05.2024. These refugees are reported to be civilians from Ruma Upazila and its surrounding Lairunpi and Bethel villages who reportedly try to escape the atrocities of Bangladesh Army caused by the ongoing combing operation conducted by the Bangladesh Government in the aftermath of the bank robberies alleged to be committed by Kuki Chin National Front (KNF) on 02.02.2024 and 03.02.2024. Again, on the late night of 18.5.2024 and on the morning of 19.5.2024, Bangladesh refugees (Bawm community) from several villages of Bandarbans District, Bangladesh entered Vathuampui village, Lawngtlai District, Mizoram while another group of refugees also entered Hruitezawl village of Lawngtlai District on 19.5.2024. With this latest influx of Bangladesh Nationals, the total number of Bangladesh refugees in Mizoram increases to 1537 (one thousand five hundred thirty seven ) as on 22.05.2024.
