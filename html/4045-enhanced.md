Subj. : Security Assessment - reg.

Ref. :  No.DIG(NR)/ELECT/2021/142 dt.09.10.2024.

Sir

  Kindly refer to your letter No. cited above, I am submitting herewith the required information for your kind information please:-

1. With the coming General Election to the 2nd Sinlung Hills Council, 2024, preliminary threat and security assessment of the council area has been conducted by CID (SB) in the wake of the statements issued by some groups of Hmar community. The reports of the assessment may be summarized as follows:

1. Ex-Hmar Volunteer Association having its Headquarters at Sakawrdai which advocated candidature of HPC party at Sakawrdai is reportedly contented with the candidature of Pu Lalremmuanpuia of ZPM at Sakawrdai North Constituency. As such, the group reportedly has no intention of disturbing the Sinlung Hills Council Election, 2024.

1. Hmar Region Autonomous Council having its Headquarters at Hmarkawlien, Assam in its statement issued on 26.09.2024 expressed its disapproval of the mischief caused by some faction of HPC (D) which refused to sign an agreement with the Government of Mizoram in the year 2018 and condemned the actions of the HPC (D) faction which tarnished the image of Hmar community in the state of Mizoram as well as in Assam. It further demanded the member of the HPC (D) faction to surrender themselves to the government or leave Cachar Area, Assam.

1. Hmar Peoples’ Convention – Democratic (HPC-D) Lalhmingthanga Sanate faction in its Statement issued on 02.10.2024 warned the people and candidates of the upcoming Sinlung Hills Council not to take any steps without the approval of the HPC (D) and urged the public not to oppose the activities of the group. Nonetheless, as per scheduled of the State Election Commission, list of valid candidates and their symbols had been published without any reports of threats from any groups. However, since HPC (D) Lalhmingthanga Sanate faction has current grievances regarding its demand for political level talks and formation of Interim Government within SHC, the possibility of making threat to the public, candidates or village/unit political party leaders through telephone calls by the group before the poll day is possible.

It may also be mentioned that the people of Sinlung Hills Council and Ex-Hmar Volunteer Association not only did not support the activities of HPC (D) Lalhmingthanga Sanate Faction but on the contrary are against the mischief committed inside Mizoram in the past by members of the group.

1. The present strength of CID (SB) Unit did not allow posting of additional staff at Sakawrdai area. However, the situations and progress of any individual or groups who may have impact on the election is closely monitored from CID (SB) Headquarters as well as Sector Officers of Saitual Sector, Vairengte Sector and Sakawrdai Sector. It is suggested that SP Aizawl may deploy his staff from District Special Branch at Sakawrdai area.

1. List of known active cadres of HPC (D) Lalhmingthanga Sanate faction is enclosed in separate sheet.

Enclo: As stated.

 Yours faithfully
