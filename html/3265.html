<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">As seen in the news report, the accused was arrested at Jowai by Jowai policemen on Monday i.e. dt. 8.8.2022 @ 9:00 pm as he was carrying /transporting indigenous birds in the vehicle he drove (Mahindra Bolero bearing reg. No. MZ 01 R 0463). After the arrest i.e. on the next day, Jowai Police handed him over to Forest Department of Jowai, where a case was registered against him and later send him to Judicial custody for trial. Since the accused cannot be contacted, not much can be known about the owner of the vehicle he drove and from where he acquired those indigenous birds.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">During the enquiry, attempts had been made to identify the present owner of the seized vehicle that NK Thangtea drove and it was found out that various persons had previously owned the said vehicle. The first owner being Zohmangaiha of Ratu who bought it in the month of October, 2018, he had done the vehicle&#39;s registration using his elder sister&#39;s name - Vanlalhriati of Bawngkawn as he wanted the vehicle to bear MZ 01 registration. The first owner used the vehicle as private rental cab but after it had been service for sometimes, the owner&#39;s son &lsquo;Kima&rsquo; put it as security (dahkham) in one company from which he (the son) borrowed some amount of money. From that company, the vehicle was then bought by one Lalremruatkima of Aizawl who then sold it to one vehicle reseller Kima of Republic veng, Aizawl. This reseller Kima later sold it to one other reseller, Chuailova of Nursery veng, &nbsp;Aizawl. The reseller Chuailova then again sold it to other person on the Month of May this year i.e 2022. Unfortunately, this reseller Chuailova could no longer remember the person who had bought it from him and as he recently used new mobile handset, he had no longer kept his old contacts (buyers contact numbers). The only event the said reseller Chuailova can recollect was that two young men who claimed themselves residents of Ramhlun veng, Aizawl came at night during the month of May and bought the said vehicle from him and made the payment through net banking transaction. So, as of now, further lead could not be acquired to identify the present owner. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">During enquiry, Police personnel at Jowai P/S were also contacted and from them the address of the accused was acquired which showed that his present address was Ramhlun South, Aizawl. The acquired address was searched, and it was found that he was actually living with his parents and other three siblings in Zomi Baptist Church Quarters at Ramhlun South, Aizawl, and his father being caretaker for the said church. Upon asking his parents, they said that in the year 2020, they bought one Maxicab Sumo which their son (the accused) used it to drive between Aizawl and Guwahati carrying passengers to and fro. But their Sumo was later sold to other person in the next year 2021 and since then he (NK Thangtea) did not drive any vehicle permanently but drove different vehicles from time to time which were available for service at those times, the parents stated. Regarding the owner of the vehicle he drove while he was arrested and also about the birds he was carrying, the parents claimed not to have known anything at all what their son was up to. His close friend, Jacob who is also a Sumo maxi cab driver was also contacted but he too did not bear any useful information about &nbsp;him. It may be noted that his (the accused) family shifted to Manipur state from Murlen village, Mizoram during MNF insurgent movement and again returned to Mizoram from Manipur on 2000.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">It may also be noted that, during the enquiry, Jowai Police could not provide much information about NK Thangtea as they claimed to have not collected or recorded any information about him as they claimed to have arrested him during night time and then later send him to Forest department the next day without further delay. In this regard, personnel of Forest department at Jowai were thoroughly contacted and from them it was found that after Jowai Police handed them over NK Thangtea, they registered a case against him and send him to Judicial custody without delay. Requisition to share NK Thangtea statements and any other related information about the case was made thoroughly but one Range officer of Jowai Forest Department who took up the case would not provide anything as he claimed that the case was confidential. Upon repetitive requesting, the said Range officer of Forest deptt. @ Jowai said his DFO would not let him share information to us and further claimed that his DFO told him that Court permission was needed to share such information/documents to us. So, much further information about NK Thangtea&rsquo;s case cannot yet be obtained as of now. However, attempt is still going on to talk to NK Thangtea himself directly to know the real circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
