No.MSB/CB/SR/2019/83

Dated: 7th February, 2019.

Information has been received that Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Forum (MBDPF) organised a meeting of all Bru NGOs from the 6 (six) Bru Transit Camps, i.e. Naisingpara, Asapara, Kaiskaupara, Hamsapara, Hazacherra and Khakchangpara in Tripura, at MBDPF Office in Naisingpara Bru Transit Camp yesterday, i.e. 6.2.2019 @ 12:00 noon which was presided over by A. Sawibunga, President, MBDPF and attended by around 150 (one hundred fifty) members. The meeting deliberated on the hardships faced by the Bru residents of the camps due to irregular hand-out of free ration and cash dole for their assistance since October, 2018. The meeting decided to submit a Memorandum to the following Officials for the immediate addressal of their sufferings :-

1. Shri. Rajiv Gauba, Union Home Secretary.
2. Shri. Satyendra Garg, Jt. Secretary (NE), MHA.
3. Justice H.L. Dutta, Chairman, National Human Rights Commission.

In pursuance of the decision of their meeting, all NGOs of Bru Transit Camps submitted the above mentioned Memorandum through the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM), Kanchanpur, North Tripura today, i.e. 07.02.2019.

The Memorandum also highlighted that they will resort to the following action plans to pressurize their demand if immediate relief is not received as desired :-

1. Mass rally from Naisingpara to Dosda RD Block on 13.02.2019.
2. 3 days Sit-in demonstration at SDM Office at Kanchanpur from 18-20.02.2019.
3. Blockade of Kanchanpur to Ananda Bazar main road on 26.02.2019.
4. Bill sticking campaign on 05.03.2019 along Choraibari (Assam to Tripura Border) to Agartala National Highway.
5. Long march from Naisingpara Camp to the Office of District Magistrate, Dharmanagar which is approximately 100 km distance (date to be finalised later).

It may be mentioned that majority of the Brus in the transit camps have been reported to be hugely in favour of returning to Mizoram at the earliest which may have been fuelled by the above problems faced by the Bru residents of the transit camps. However, the MBDPF leaders have been putting a strong claim that these Brus demanded advance disbursement of housing assistance and construction of houses before the commencement of actual physical repatriation.
