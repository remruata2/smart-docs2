****SPECIAL REPORT****

No.MSB/CB/SR/2020/160

Dated: 17th March, 2020.

 As per reliable input, MZP is learnt to be extremely disappointed and unhappy over recent resumption of construction works of Masjid at Zophai, Bairabi by the Kachurthal Masjid Committee. It strongly felt that this is in direct contravention to already agreed maintenance of Status Quo in the disputed Mizoram - Assam border by both sides. It also condemns the apparent lack of concern or silence of the Government of Mizoram over the violation of Status Quo. As a result, MZP felt it necessary to initiate action so as to give a wakeup call to the Government by way of proceeding to Bairabi on 18.3.2020 in which around 15-20 MZP Gen. Hqrs. members led by Pu B. Vanlaltana, President will prepare necessary materials (mainly Columns/Pillars) at Bairabi for eventual construction of ‘Zofate Chawlhbuk’ at Zophai. As per input, the said construction will be undertaken only if construction works of the Masjid is resumed in violation of Status Quo. Until then, MZP will continue to closely monitor the situation and any act of violation of status quo will result in construction of Zofate Chawlhbuk. Members of MZP Gen. Headquarters will be accompanied by leaders of Kolasib MZP Hqrs.

 Recapping recent development, on Dt.12.3.2020, Pu Lalnunmawia Pautu, General Secretary, MZP Gen. Headquarters, accompanied by leaders of MZP Headquarters, Kolasib and MZP Sub-Headquarters, Bairabi visited Zophai where the previously suspended construction of the alleged illegal Masjid was resumed recently. They dismantled some of the bamboo poles which were positioned for supporting the intended slab construction of the Masjid. In a subsequent Press Release issued, MZP demanded the State Government to put more efforts in safeguarding the State border and that the Mizo Zirlai Pawl is ever ready to resort to any means to protect Mizoram border.

 Situation under close watch.
