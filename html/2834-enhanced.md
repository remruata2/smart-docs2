****HMAR PEOPLES CONVENTION (DEMOCRATIC)****

**1. Background :**

 The Hmars, an ethnic group of Mizoram mostly settled in the North Eastern part of the State have been aspiring for a separate administrative set up mainly due to the instigation of the elite and educated members of the community who propounded that the Hmars are a separate ethnic community with distinct culture as compared to the Mizo speaking populace of Mizoram. However, it may be mentioned here that the Hmars were never regarded as a distinct ethnic community, historically and culturally. Their only distinctiveness is that they spoke the Hmar dialect which is however having very close affinity to Mizo - a dialect of the Luseis - which is now accepted as the official language of Mizoram. The Hmars also spread-out as far as Haflong in North Cachar Hills District of Assam and the Churachandpur District of Manipur. It may be mentioned here that the settlement of the Hmars in the adjoining areas of Manipur and Assam among other ethnic groups with distinct cultures and customs gradually made them ethnically self-conscious and vulnerable. This sentiment of alienation gave birth to political aspirations among the elite section of the community culminating in the formation of political platform such as the Hmar National Union (HNU) etc. as late as in 1957 with the proclaimed objective of preserving the democratic rights, culture and ethnic identity of the Hmars within their dominated areas of Manipur and Assam.

**2. Demand for Autonomous District Council by HPC :**

 The Hmars being a dominant ethnic group of Mizoram have never felt the need nor aspired for any special political status for their community in Mizoram. They were a secured and contented community. However, mainly due to the influence of the Hmars living out side the State, politically ambitious section of the community started propounding the need for preserving their democratic rights, culture and ethnic identity. In 1986 the Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC) was formed with the sole objective of the creation of an Autonomous District Council (ADC) for the Hmars within Mizoram. Simultaneously, extreme elements of the HPC cadres took up arms and resorted to violent unlawful activities like abducting and killing of the Mizoram Police personnel, extorting money etc. and thus jeopardising the law and order situation of the State particularly in the Hmar dominated area.

**3. Signing of Peace Accord :**

 The Mizoram Police was geared up and the Government of Mizoram eventually managed to contain the activities of the HPC militants resulting in the signing of a Peace Accord on 27th July 1994. The HPC militants surrendered formally to the Govt. of Mizoram as per the provision of this Accord and these persons were given financial grants for their rehabilitation etc. The Govt. of Mizoram also agreed to set up the Sinlung Hills Div. Council (SHDC) for the socio-economic upliftment of the people living in the Hmar dominated areas. Accordingly adhoc Chairman and members constituting the council were even appointed by the Govt. of Mizoram from among the leaders of the erstwhile HPC set up. Peace was thus restored in Mizoram after the signing of the Accord.

**4. Formation of HPC-'D' :**

 However, inspite of the above there were still a disgruntled section of the HPC set up, led by Lalhmingthanga Senate, the then General Secretary of the HPC who were not ready to lay down their arms as they were not in agreement with the terms of the Peace Accord. Soon after, a new militant outfit was formed by L.Z. Hrangchal, the then Marshal of HPC, known as the _'Hmar Revolutionary Front'_ (HRF) with base in Parbung Sub-Division of Churachandpur District, Manipur. Following closely, Lalhmingthanga Senate also formed a militant outfit called the Hmar Peoples Convention -Democratic (HPC-'D') in 1996 with its nerve centre at Hmarkhawlian (Lakhipur) in Cachar District of Assam. The 2 (two) newly formed outfits are totally opposed to each other both proclaiming themselves as champion of the political aspirations of the Hmars, and both resorted to seeking the assistance of other insurgents such as the NSCN(I/M) and the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) for subduing each other in their struggle for supremacy. Lalhmingthanga Senate in particular has been having close connection with the NSCN(I/M) even before the signing of the Peace Accord in 1994. It may be mentioned that Lalhmingthanga Senate did not surrender to the Govt. of Mizoram in 1994 and hence floated the militant outfit known as the Hmar Peoples Convention-Democratic (HPC-'D') in the later part of 1996. Following the surrender of the HRF outfit in 2000, Lalhmingthang Senate cut off ties with the NSCN(I/M) and established close ties with the UNLF/PREEPAK of Manipur.

**5. Objective :**

 As mentioned above Lalhmingthanga Senate did not come overground in 1994 as he refused to accept the Accord signed between the Govt. of Mizoram and the HPC set up. He remained underground and continued liaison with the cadres of the NSCN(I/M) and spent his time in Hmarkhawlian in Cachar District area and Haflong in North Cachar Hills District of Assam. He claimed himself leader of the un-subdued HPC faction till striving for a separate homeland for the Hmars.

  However, he is of late advocating that the Govt. of Mizoram has deliberately delayed the implementation of the Peace Accord signed in 1994, though himself refusing to accept the terms and conditions of the said Accord. It may be mentioned here that the Govt. is having no intention of not implementing the Peace Accord as can be seen from the appointment of the Chairman and Members of Sinlung Hills Development Council (SHDC) in 1997. Therefore, the HPC-'D' led by Lalhmingthanga Senate has nothing to do with the implementation or non-implementation of the Peace deal reached between the Govt. of Mizoram and the erstwhile HPC.

 The HPC-D may therefore be regarded as a group of disillusioned youths who can be branded only as "TERRORISTS" with no legitimate political cause. The HPC-D in other words can be described as the private army of Lalhmingthanga Senate formed solely to further his private interests.
