****AGENDA****

**(1) SECURITY**

**(a)** **Insurgent Group along the border :**

  Presently, the Peoples' Liberation Army(PLA) and Zomi Revolutionary Army(ZRA) (Manipur based insurgent groups) are having permanent camp inside Myanmar adjacent to Mizoram. This matter needs to be discussed seriously with Myanmar government since the PLA and ZRA are imparting training to various underground outfit of the Northeast. It has also been ascertained that different Northeast insurgent groups like United National Liberation Front(UNLF), National Democratic Front of Bodo Land(NDFB), United Liberation Front of Assam(ULFA) and National Liberation Front of Tripura(NLFT) etc occasionally have meetings inside Myanmar and used Mizoram as a conduit for illegal movements and activities. Alertness must be maintained regarding this matter.

 

**(b)**  A**rms Smuggling****:**

 Mizoram being located at a strategic point with foreign countries with porous international borders, has been vulnerable, a conduit for transporting arms and ammunitions, drugs and contraband items by various insurgent groups and smugglers. However, due to the sustained efforts by Mizoram Police, during the last one year (i.e. 2015) as many as 39 sophisticated weapons and about 6586 ammunitions were recovered from various arms smugglers and insurgent groups which clearly highlighted the vulnerability of the State as a transit route for arms smuggling.

 Besides, contraband goods coming from Myanmar side and illegally entering into Mizoram through Myanmar - Mizoram border side has also negatively affected the economic growth of the State. The recent increase in the smuggling of one new type of drugs, Pseudoephedrine coming from mainland India into Myanmar side through Mizoram State has called for immediate and proper attention and Mizoram Police has made constant efforts to effect several recoveries.

**(c)** **Exchange of Intelligence Information :**

  Interrogation reports of captured insurgents, arms smugglers, drug traffickers may be shared uniformly at an early time to have better control of illegal and unwanted movements in the border.

**(d) Any other security issue :**

  Mizoram is having approximately 512 kms. porous international border with Myanmar. The porous international borders served as an important route for IIGs to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, etc across the borders of Mizoram. In addition, two big infrastructure project viz. Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project(KMMTTP), Bairabi-Sairang-Hmawngbuchhuah railway line being implemented in Mizoram under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners across Mizoram from Myanmar and would also encourage illegal criminal activities across the border.
