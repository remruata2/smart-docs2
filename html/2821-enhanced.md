**Conclusion and Suggestions:**

 The outfit named ‘Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA) was raised and coined by LalhmingthangaSanate, founder President, HPC (D) in his attempt to take personal advantage  of the recently tensed Assam-Mizoram inter-state border situation. It may be worth mentioning that investigation of the above mentioned case revealed that cadre of ‘Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA) implanted explosives attached with detonator (approx. 2 kgs) which was recovered near the construction site of Bridge connecting Pu Chalchhunga’s farm land to Pu Lalnuntluanga’s farm land across Saihapui river, Phainuam-Buarchep area on 6.11.2021 @10:25 a.m.

 It is suggested that immediate arrest of Lalhmingthanga Sanate, founder President, HPC (D) and the absconding accused is the need of the hour as they may pose threat to internal security of both states viz. Mizoram and Assam, and Non-mizos residing along the inter-state border and Assam Police deployed along the inter-state border.
