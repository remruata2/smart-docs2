****Report on Security Threat Perception (STP) assessment on deployment of static security at the Control room of the Income tax surveillance team for Mizoram Election, 2018 at Tourist Lodge, Chaltlang and two Armed Security personnel to accompany AIU team daily from Aizawl to Lengpui Airport****

The Control Room of the Income tax surveillance team of Mizoram Election, 2018 is presently manned by Pu Nichky LL Sherpa, IRS, Dy. Director (Investigation) as Officer-in-Charge of the Control Room and 5 (five) Inspectors on a 10 (ten) day rotation from their office at Guwahati, and that the request for providing security for the team was done due to the recent demonstration led by the All NGO Co-ordination Committee for the removal of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Mizoram on the recent Bru Issue.

With the transfer of the Chief Electoral Officer of Mizoram and the suspension of the demonstration in a peaceful manner, the request for Armed Security for Airport Intelligence Unit (AIU) and Static Security for the Control Room at Tourist Lodge, Chaltlang, is no longer felt required by the Surveillance team.

Hence, provision of Security duty as requested by Sh. H.D. Simte, IRS, Asst Director of Income Tax (Inv), Guwahati &amp; Officer In-charge of Control room, Aizawl for Mizoram Election, 2018 is considered unnecessary as of now.
