**(1) SECURITY ISSUES**

**(a) Security Cooperation along common order:**

**(i)** **Cooperation to check activities of Indian Insurgent Group:-**

  Presently, the Peoples' Liberation Army(PLA) and Zomi Revolutionary Army(ZRA) (Manipur based insurgent groups) are having permanent camp inside Myanmar adjacent to Mizoram. This matter needs to be discussed seriously with Government of Myanmar since the PLA and ZRA are imparting training to various underground outfits of the North East. It has also been ascertained that different North East insurgent groups like United National Liberation Front(UNLF), National Democratic Front of Bodo Land(NDFB), United Liberation Front of Assam(ULFA) and National Liberation Front of Tripura(NLFT) etc occasionally have meetings inside Myanmar and used Mizoram as a conduit for illegal movements and activities. Alertness must be maintained regarding this matter.

 

**(ii)** **Cooperation to check**A**rms Smuggling:-**

  Mizoram being located at a strategic point with foreign countries with porous international borders, has been vulnerable, a conduit for transporting arms and ammunitions, drugs and contraband items by various Insurgent groups and Smugglers. However, due to the sustained efforts by Mizoram Police, during the last 3 (three) years (i.e. 2016 - September, 2018) as many as 33 sophisticated weapons and about 3,752 ammunitions were recovered from various Arms smugglers and Insurgent groups which clearly highlighted the vulnerability of the State as a transit route for arms smuggling.

 Besides, contraband goods coming from Myanmar side and illegally entering into Mizoram through Myanmar - Mizoram border side has also negatively affected the economic growth of the State.

**(b)** **Exchange of Intelligence Information:**

  Interrogation reports of captured/arrested cadres of Insurgent outfits, arms smugglers, drug traffickers may be shared uniformly at an early time to have better control of illegal and unwanted movements in the border.

**(c) Any other security issue:**

 Mizoram is having approximately 510 kms. porous international border with Myanmar. The porous international borders served as an important route for IIGs to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, gold etc across the borders of Mizoram. In addition, two big infrastructure project viz. Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), Bairabi-Sairang-Hmawngbuchhuah railway line being implemented in Mizoram under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners across Mizoram from Myanmar and would also encourage illegal criminal activities across the border.

 As many as 1,750 Myanmarese Nationals fled to Mizoram during the last 1 (one) year due to fierce fighting between Myanmar Army (MA) and Arakan Army (AA). The offensive operation being launched by Myanmar Army (MA) against Arakan Army (AA) along Mizoram-Myanmar border is having security implications for Mizoram. It is, therefore, extremely important to strengthen deployment of security personnel along Mizoram-Myanmar border.
