**Theme 41st Point No. 5****:**

**Terrorism**

Terrorist Organisations today have easy access to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials (CBRN). So it is important that the State Police as well as all the security agencies are well equipped to handle any threat posed by CBRN hazard.

 All sections of the society are at equal risks of getting exposed to CBRN hazards. It is learnt that big terror outfits like Al-Qaida etc. have underwent training on chemical and biological weapons which vindicated the fears of the MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) and this insecurity of MHA prompted the raising of QRTs (Quick Reaction Teams) and Quick Reaction Medical Teams to immediately respond to contingencies arising out of CBRN weapons on the national soil. However, the State Police in most states of India still haven’t embraced the nuances of CBRN materials. This does not mean that the State Police should sit idle and stay ignorant of the threat posed by chemical or biological hazards. It is high time that the State Police have started imparted trainings to its personnel on CBRN defence. It would be ideal to set up QTR and QRMT in order to deal with any emergency that may arise out of CBRN.

 There had been freak accidents related to radiological or chemical weapons solely due to negligence or carelessness on the parts of scientists or technicians who were entrusted with CBRN equipments. These accidents showed that all sections of the society including the Police force are at risks of being victimised by CBRN exposure. So, it is strongly suggested that Police personnel should undergo training on CBRN threats which would make them aware on CBRN hazards. An awareness campaign through training etc. is needed as in most cases of accidents or mishaps, the Police personnel are called upon to investigate or examine on the spot, the cause of such accidents etc. which put them largely at risks of getting exposed to deadly chemical hazards.

 Strengthening of intelligence network is very important for prevention or detection of crime. The security agencies as well as the Police forces in all the states must establish good rapport at all levels in order to ensure that intelligence are shared and that co-operation among the forces is fostered. The states which are situated along the international boundary are more vulnerable to any attacks be it CBRN or others. So it is crucial that border checking is efficiency carried out on all movements of goods and vehicles. It is also important that technology or equipments which are advanced enough to detect any contraband substance is set up at border check post to assist the troops while carrying out their duties.

 Upgradation of technology to fight against CBRN attacks is always supported but it is also necessary to know that not all states have the necessary tools or techniques to deal with CBRN attacks. So, it is strongly suggested that infrastructure for dealing with CBRN threat is set up in all the states in order to minimize any danger that could arise out of CBRN hazards.

**Theme 42nd Point No.9****:**

**Technology as an aid to fight Left Wing Extremist/Terrorism and Insurgency**

Left Wing extremist have gained a strong foothold in India. They have become well organized and that it is increasingly becoming difficult day by day to root out the terrorists from their stronghold.

 The terrorist groups have caused destruction of lives and property to thousands of innocent lives throughout the world. The Government cannot afford to sit idle and be a mere spectator to terrorist activities. The government of India has also spent man power as well as money in order to fight against terrorism or insurgency. So far, there have been mixed results. The NTRO (National Technical Research Organisation) a highly specialized technical intelligence gathering agency was set up by the Central government with the aim of providing and assisting the security forces with intelligence output. It is strongly suggested that technology which is advanced enough to detect any activity of the insurgents is developed so that our security forces are more successful in their operations. There are thick forests which serves as a safe haven for terrorists outfits. Penetrating these safe haven is extremely difficult and risky for our troops as they have not acquired required technical inputs regarding the mentioned areas. Advance technology such as thermal imagery from satellites etc. have been acquired but sometimes this does not provide accurate information so relying too much on technology is not the sole option to fight terrorism.

 Dog Squads provide useful assistance to military forces, while launching operations against the terrorist outfits. This is a trend which can be continued as the results so far is significant. Moreover dependence on dog squad can prove fatal as animals sometimes can fail due to several reasons such as sickness etc. It is suggested that dog squad be deployed as a force multiplier in case of counter insurgency operations.
