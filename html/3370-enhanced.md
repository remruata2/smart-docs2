SECURITY SCENERIO OF MIZORAM :

 A couple of years back, Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018. However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and planning to reorganise themselves which could, in due course of time, pose security problems especially in the northern most and north eastern parts of Mizoram.

Lalhmingthanga Sanate decided to raise new outfit in the name of “Mizoram Border Defence Army (MBDA)” with the following plan of actions:

1. To launch attack against Assam Police deployed along Assam-Mizoram border with Arms.
2. Non-mizo residing along the inter-state border should be threatened/intimidated.
3. Sufficient number of arms and ammunitions should be procured from National Socialist Council of Nagaland –NSCN (IM).
4. Donation should be collected from residents of Saiphai, Mizoram and its surrounding areas for procurement of arms and ammunitions.

_kuki chin national front (KNF) :_

 This organisation was founded in the year 2008 by elements of Zo- ethnic living in Bangladesh as Kuki-Chin National Development Organisation (KNDO).

 Two years after its establishment,leaders of this organisation sought assistance from Kachin National Army (KNA), a militant outfit operating in Myanmar, for training which resulted in about 20-40 KNDO cadres receiving training from KNA during the year 2017-2020. After these cadres completed their training, their organisation was renamed as Kuki Chin National Front (KNF).

 The main objective of this organisation is to unite Zo-ethnic tribes including CHIN tribes living in Myanmar - Bangladesh bordering areas into one autonomous region having a development budget of their own from Bangladesh Government.

 It may also be mentioned that, after the completion of their training under KNA, cadres of KNF did not take any Arms and Ammunitions with them as this could hamper their safe return journey home to Bangladesh.

 Leaders of Kuki-Chin National Front from Bangladesh frequently visited Mizoram where they often met leaders of PAMRA and even Government officials whenever necessary. Some of them even proceeded up to Myanmar during these visits.

CAMPS: The Head Quarters of KNF is situated at SALOPI, Bandarbham district, near RUMA BAZAR in Bangladesh. Other camps are also established at Chittagong and Khakrasuri areas.

CAMPS INSIDE MIZORAM: Presently, KNF has no camp inside Mizoram.

NUMBERS OF CADRES: KNF claims to have around 700 cadres which includes civil and Army wing. However, other source believed them to be around 500-600 in numbers.

KNF IN AIZAWL/MIZORAM: At present, there are no top officials nor Leaders of KNF in Mizoram as all of them are in Bangladesh. At the same time 2/3 of their cadres are presently staying in Aizawl.

LEADERS OF KNF:

 1. President : Nathan, @ Nathan Bawm of Ruma, Eden Road,   Bangladesh

_Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) Eastern Command :_

 The operational areas of ZRA Eastern Command, who are commanded by SS Colonel Kham Min Thang includes the areas around Tidim,Tonzang and Chikha inside Myanmar.

 For a long period, ZRA had prohibited the establishment of any armed group within their operational areas. However, after the creation of Civil Disobedience Movement as a result of the 2021 military coup of Myanmar, several armed groups have sprung up which includes People Defence Force (PDF) Zoland inside the operational areas of ZRA. This greatly displeased ZRA who strongly opposed the activities of PDF Zoland, often resulting in threats and even violence against these PDF Zoland members.

 Below are some of the instances when ZRA resorted to intimidation and violence against PDF members :

1. From the month of May 2021,elected MLA/MP from Tidim and Tonzang township who fled to Mizoram have received repeated threatening calls through mobile phones.

2. Five (5) persons from Khawzimpui village were severely beaten on September 2021.

3. During the month of June/July 2021, PDF cadres, who were undergoing training inside Ngur Village Council areas on the banks of Tiau river were scattered and their belongings destroyed by ZRA.

4. On 5.12.2021(Sunday), one Cin Siam Sum,who is a former Personal Secretary to an Ex-Minister, Mr.Mang Hen Dal, was murdered in his residence of Tidim township by 2 ZRA cadres.

 Apart from the above mentioned incidents, PDF members have often received threats and warning from ZRA multiple times through direct verbal and mobile phone calls.

 To this day, there has been no reports of SS Colonel Kham Min Thang and his men entering Mizoram territory be it the district of Champhai nor Saitual district. To corroborate this, when ZRA agent in Champhai and their PRO at Hrianghmun were contacted, they clearly express their unawareness of any ZRA Eastern Command personnel entering inside Mizoram.

****NOTES ON PREVAILING DRUG SITUATION IN MIZORAM****

**Introduction:**

******Mizoram has a long international boundary with two countries (496.53 kms with Myanmar and 319.79 kms with Bangladesh) and 284 kms of inter-state boundaries with three other north-eastern states – Assam, Tripura and Manipur. Interestingly Mizoram lies at the periphery of the Golden Triangle historically known for its drug manufacturing and trade. Mizoram has porous international border****with Myanmar and Bangladesh, the rough terrain, lack of proper connectivity poses a huge challenge to security forces at the border areas, it hampers their movement and limit their ability to check drug trafficking and to rapidly respond to attempts made by criminals.**

**Prevailing drug situation in Mizoram:**

 There has been an increase in illegal cross-border drug smuggling in recent years and Mizoram has become a favorable transit route for transporting them to other parts of the country. Major drugs trafficked into Mizoram are heroin, methamphetamine, ganja, pseudoephedrine and codeine based cough syrup. The routes of drugs trafficked in Mizoram are as follows:

1. Heroin is smuggled mainly from Myanmar and Assam for local consumption.
2. Methamphetamine (Yaba tablets) are smuggled from Myanmar through Mizoram for transporting to mainland and neighbouring country like Bangladesh.
3. Ganja is smuggled mainly from Manipur and other parts of mainland India for local consumption.
4. There is reverse trafficking of Pseudoephedrine, which are smuggled from mainland India through Mizoram into Myanmar. The smuggled Pseudoephedrine is used for preparation of Methamphetamine and the finished products i.e. Methamphetamine tablets were smuggled back into Mizoram from Myanmar for further distribution in the mainland and Bangladesh. Last seizure of Pseudoephedrine was in July, 2019.

**Reasons:**

****The following points may be the reasons of drugs trafficking in Mizoram:-

1. Insufficient border guards to check cross-trafficking along the Indo-Myanmar border
2. Demands among the local populace
3. Mizoram being a peaceful state, drug trafficker take advantage of it.

**Strategy for combating drug trafficking:**

In addition to the above, Mizoram police has adopted the following strategy to combat drugs trafficking in Mizoram:

1. A booklet on detailed strategy for combating smuggling and trafficking of drugs in Mizoram was drawn up and circulated to all concerned for taking actions as per the strategy laid down in the book.
2. Awareness Campaigns have been frequently conducted in border villages along the Mizoram-Myanmar border.
3. Special Awareness Programmes for Hotel Owners and Managers are organised in Aizawl.
4. A short clip/video was prepared featuring the local celebrities and were circulated through various social media platforms on ‘International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking’ on June 26.
5. Information regarding seizure of drugs and conviction of offenders are promptly uploaded on social media by Mizoram Police Social Media Cell and also disseminated through other media channels by Public Relations Officer.
6. A ‘Canine Squad’ has been set up by Mizoram Police with the assistance from NCB for narcotic control. These canine are stationed at different District Executive Force unit and Battalions, they have been utilized on need basis.

**Conclusion:**

Though Mizoram Police has made tremendous efforts in fight against illicit drugs and arrest of traffickers over the years, the drugs menace in the state has not been abated till date. It is the need of the hour to strengthen the police force in all possible ways and it is expected that strengthening of police with modern equipment, monetary resources etc. would be vital for curbing the drugs menace in the state.
