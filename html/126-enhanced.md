****PROPOSAL FOR RESTRUCTURING, STRENGTHENING AND INTERNALCONNECTIVITY OF THE STATE SPECIAL BRANCH****

**MAN POWER**

It is known fact that Mizoram is located in a strategically important place having 722 Kms of International Border (300 Km with Bangladesh in the West, 404 Kms with Myanmar in the east and South) which are infested by various types of insurgents outfit. It has often been alleged that gun runner, illicit drug traffickers and FICN carrier are taking advantage of the strategic location and the prevailing peaceful situation to carry on their illegal trade which could not be ruled out as illicit drugs, sophisticated arms and FICN have been seized on many occasions.

 Besides to keep a close vigil on the movement of the above noted undesirable elements the Special Branch has to monitor the activities of various political parties, NGOs, Student Organisation, Labour &amp; Services on day-to-day basis. At present, there are around 100 different Labour &amp; Services Organizations, 160 NGOs, 140 Student Organizations in the Capital alone. Present strength of Special Branch infact could not only cope up with the activities of these organization, but also most of the Head Constables posted in the Sector Office are very senior and old aged and are on the verge of their superannuation.

 In view of the reason stated above and the ever increasing activities of the undesirable elements and political parties, NGOs, etc. it is felt inevitable to increase manpower of State Special Branch
