**(b) Current trends in smuggling of narcotics drugs, arms, explosives, WLS and other contrabands :**

****Drug Smugglings****

 Mizoram being geographically close to the Golden/Death Triangle and due to the porous unfenced international border with Myanmar became a frequented route for drug smugglers in recent years. Mizoram which also shares inter-state boundary with three other Indian states is also used as a gateway for trafficking of drugs and other contraband items from Myanmar to Mainland India. Also, the recent unrest in Myanmar causing the decline in the number of military check gates on the Myanmar side and the Myanmar Nationals seeking asylum in India acting as a peddlers/dealers to support themselves financially resulted in the increase of drug trafficking in Indo-Myanmar border. As communal violence occurred in Manipur, which was reportedly one of the major smuggling routes, smugglers could no longer used Manipur as their route; the peaceful state of Mizoram become more vulnerable to such smugglers.
****Comparative drugs seizure by Mizoram Police during 2020 – 2023****

| **Name of Drugs** |  | **Seized Quantity** |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | **2021** | **2022**  | **2023**  | **2024 till March** |
| Heroin | 15.792 Kgs |  | 49.367 kgs | 68.055 kgs | 22.41 kgs |
| Methamphetamine | 153.778 Kgs |  | 217.295 kgs | 203.176 kgs | 16.895kgs |
| Crystal Meth |  |  |  |  | 10.385 kgs |

 As clearly seen from the above tables, seizures of drugs and other controlled substances are increasing rapidly, which clearly indicated that Mizoram became the major route of drugs smuggling between Myanmar and mainland India. Police Department should conduct more random and check-gate checking during the upcoming GAE 2023.

District affected :

 The districts which are mainly used by drugs smugglers for trafficking of drugs and other contraband items are :

1. Champhai District
2. Khawzawl District
3. Saitual District
4. Aizawl District
5. Kolasib District and
6. Mamit District

 It seems the CDF (Hualngoram) are now playing vital role in restricting Drugs entry into Mizoram. On 29th March 2024, Hualngoram Police in Myanmar seized 228 packets (hawng) of Heroin near Indo-Myanmar Border which are meant to transported to Mizoram.
