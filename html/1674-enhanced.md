****BRIEF BACKGROUND HISTORY****:****

 Born and brought up from Selawn, a small village of Falam District in Chin State of Myanmar. Parents separated before his birth and was raised by his mother without any other sibling. Read upto Class-IV from Leilet Primary School.

 Joined an UG outfit CNF (Chin National Front) Nothankap’s faction at a tender age of 15. He was recruited by one Chiluai in 1996 and was taken to Aizawl. After a brief stay in the house of Nothankap at Mission Veng, Aizawl, he was later taken to NSCN (K) camp located in Myanmar by one Kapluai via Guwahati-Mokokchung. Names of other cadres recruited alongwith him were:-

 1. Hrangawithang  –  Killed by rival NSCN (IM) while in Nagaland.

 2. Vanhupthang  –  Falam.

 Total strength of CNF (Nothankap faction) at that time was 40-50 approx. and were patronized by NSCN (K). Did 3 months training in weapons and drill. Weapons handled were AK-47, G-3 rifle. He alongwith 5 others ran away with one Chinese Carbine in May 1998 with an intention to surrender. They approached one village Raja in Arunachal to contact the army. The army however arrested them and later handed them over to Police and jailed. Names of comrades are:-

 1. Ngunem  –  Now in Aizawl

 2. Bawilianchen

 3. Lala

 4. Kawla

 5. Vanlalhuapa  –  Now in Aizawl

 He was bailed out by one Khawtinlal of Falam in April/May 2000. His bailor Khawtinlal used to stay in Aizawl and sometimes in Shillong. He was an arms smuggler, now in USA. After his release from Tirap Jail he stayed in the house of Tialkulhthanga, his maternal uncle who was also arms smuggler. Tialkulhthanga had jumped bail and now settled in ‘Kananthar’ located on Assam side of the Assam-Meghalaya border not far from Barapani and now doing ginger farming. It was during his UG period that he had picked up Nagamnese and broken Hindi.

 After his release from Jail he stayed in the house of his uncle Tialkulhthanga at Saron Veng, Aizawl for about one month. During his stay here he married his first wife Saimani of Tahan. They again separated in 2005.

 **Involvements in arms smuggling:-**

 He started dealing in illegal arms smuggling since 2001. Initially accompanied one Lawmthanga an arms smuggler and worked for him as interpreter. Said Lawmthanga used to sell arms to John @ Silus (or Cylus). Silus is an agent who supply the weapons to various UG groups. Silus speaks different languages of North East such as Assamese, Bengali, Nagamese, Nepali, Hindi and English. He also speaks little Mizo. He claimed himself as a Naga but others who knew him said he is a Nepali. He (Silus) is well known to Hajay @ Tamang ad Daniel, DHD(J) as well as to arms smugglers namely – (1) Tialkulhthanga (2) Khawneihmanga, father of Laltea (both Myanmar origin now settling in Assam – Meghalaya border) and (3) Zaliana @ Liana of Tahan, Myanmar. He owns a house in Beltola area Guwahati but normally stayed in Shillong. He had seen the sketch of **John Mizo**released by NIA and he believed the picture matched that of John @ Silus. He himself is known to Jewel and Hajay as Joseph.

 Silus also seemed to be an influential character both to the UG as well as security agencies. He (Vantea) feared that his life could be in danger if he is detained in Assam as Silus could use both UG’s and Police to eliminate him.

 Names of arms smugglers with whom he used to have arms deals were :-

1. Lawmthanga – Tahan, Myanmar
2. Zaliana @ Liana - Tahan, Myanmar
3. Tawkneiluai @ Tawka - Tahan, Myanmar (now in Myanmar Jail)
4. Vanham @ Lalliana - Tahan, Myanmar
5. Thanga - Tahan, Myanmar
6. Sena - Tahan, Myanmar
7. Suithanhranga @ Hranga - Tahan, Myanmar
8. Sopum - Yangoon, Myanmar
9. Thomas – Mandalay, Myanmar
10. Laltea – Shillong, Meghalaya

In all, he had sold about 100 weapons (mostly AK-47 and fewer nos. of M-16, G-3 and 9mm Pistol) to DHD(J) through John @ Silus (or Cylus). Could not remember the exact time or no. of arms sold each time. The largest consignment was 23 weapons sold to DHD(J) during 2004. Transactions were normally made in Aizawl or Champhai from where the arms were delivered in Shillong. The buyers usually checked the weapons first and later paid the money in Shillong at a secret appointed place usually in Hotel or at a private house rented by Silus at Happy Valley. Sumo or Gypsy arranged by Silus or sometimes by DHD themselves are normally used for transportation. Price of an AK-47 or M-16 is approximate 2.5 lakhs to 3 lakhs depending on the condition of the weapons and he gets around Rs. 10,000 – Rs. 20,000/- commission per weapon. Any defective weapons are returned which are normally disposed off at a cheaper price to Chakma UGs through some local commission agent namely S.K.a of Chhinga Veng, Aizawl. He had also once sold G-3 Rifle which was not in good condition to Aton, NSCN (I/M) in Aizawl for Rs. 1.5 lakhs. Transactions were sometimes made without payment, and purely on mutual trust, as such the DHD(J) still has an outstanding balance of about Rs. 1 crore to be paid to Zaliana @ Liana. However, since Police are alert in Assam and Meghalaya during recent past, he dared not go there to collect the money despite pressure from Zaliana who is now in Tahan, Myanmar.

He has an Indian Passort No. G3106042 issued on 18.9.2007 valid till 17.9.2017 which he acquired through one unknown person who called himself ‘Thanga’ for which he paid Rs. 20,000/-. He also has an EPIC No. LHM 0135996 and a Driving License No. MZ 0120028882 all in the name of Vanlalchhana s/o Ngunkipthanga, Saron Veng, Aizawl H/No. D-37.

He had visited Bangkok, Thailand from 20th – 29th , Jan. 2008 and Malaysia from 29th Jan. – 7th Feb. 2008. His visit according to him was on religious meeting ( a Gospel Crusade organized by Lai Christian Fellowship). He however admitted having met Jewel and Hajay @ Tamang in Bangkok where they discussed about arms deal.

INVOLVEMENT IN BLACK MONEY EXCHANGE :

Apart from illegal arms business, he is also doing some flying business across Myanmar mainly dealing in readymade shirts, shoes, Zarda and Black-money exchange. He collects money from Myanmar businessmen in Aizawl which he exchanged with dollar in Kolkata and sometimes in Kathmandu. Dollars are again converted into Kyats in Myanmar by which he gained some profits. There are several persons of Myanmar origin in Kolkata and Kathmandu who are engaged in this Black-money exchange business. One of them is Sopum of Yangoon who is also an arms smugglers.

PRIVATE LIFE :

His marriage with first wife Saimani as well as with that of his present wife Thakipchauii were not what he called ‘love-marriage’. He met another Pawi woman named Zungmeni (34) d/o Thangchina who is doing business in readymade shirts, shoes etc. temporarily residing at Saron Veng, Aizawl in December 2008. He fell in love with this woman and even decided to divorce his wife Thakipchuaii. Since his wife did not accepted his divorce proposal, he left her and started staying with his girlfriend secretly in his girlfriend’s house from second week of June 2009. Being a Church worker himself (Chairman of LCF), he had to avoid being seen by others and so he made an excuse as if he had gone to Shillong.

 When he learnt that CID(SB) were looking for him, they shifted to the house of Ma-awmi, friend of his girlfriend at Bethlehem Vengthlang after about 2 weeks. After staying in Ma-awmi’s house for about another 2 weeks they again shifted to the house of Hnemi relative of his girlfriend whose husband is a Havildar of 3 MAP at Mualpui.

Since they still felt insecure they planned to leave Aizawl and stay hiding at the house of Lalrimawii w/o C. Vanlalruata at Lungmuat, childhood friend of Zungmeni where they believed they could hide for as long a period that might be necessary for them to hide, and in the meantime carry on his illegal arms business from there.

They left Aizawl in a Taxi on the night of 25.7.2009 @ 7:20 PM and were arrested on the same night at Lungmuat @ 0340 hrs. (26.7.2009).

Following his disclosure made during interrogation, search team recovered the following weapons and communication equipments from the house of one Nempuii (Tahan, Myanmar) at Saron Veng on 30.7.2009 @ 11:45 AM :-

1. M-16 Rifle with magazine – 8 nos.
2. 9mm Beretta (Made in USA) – 1 no.
3. 9mm Ammunitions – 14 rounds
4. Walkie Talkie sets (Ruizhonglong) alongwith Charger, Spare Batteries and Detachable Antennae – 12 nos. each.
