****SECURITY ISSUES****

**(a) Security Cooperation along common order:**

**(i) Cooperation to check Arms/Narcotic Smuggling:-**

 Mizoram being located at a strategic point with foreign countries with porous international borders, has been vulnerable, a conduit for transporting arms and ammunitions, drugs and contraband items by various Insurgent groups and Smugglers. However, due to the sustained efforts by Mizoram Police, during the last two year (i.e.2017 – 2019 till date), as many as 27 sophisticated weapons and about 2761 ammunitions were recovered from various Arms smugglers and as many as 104 narcotic cases were registered during the year 2018 to 2019 till date (Heroin-18.26 Kgs, Methamphetamine-166.313 Kgs, Pseudo-ephedrine-335 Kgs and Ganja-700 grams) which clearly highlighted the vulnerability of the State as a transit route for arms and narcotic smuggling. Besides, contraband goods coming from Myanmar side and illegally entering into Mizoram through Myanmar – Mizoram border side has also negatively affected the economic growth of the State.

**(b) Exchange of Intelligence Information :**

 Interrogation reports of captured/arrested cadres of Insurgent outfits, arms smugglers, drug traffickers may be shared uniformly at an early time to have better control of illegal and unwanted movements in the border.

**(c) Any other security issue:**

 Mizoram is having approximately 510 kms. porous international border with Myanmar. The porous international borders served as an important route for IIGs to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle drugs, gold, etc., across the borders of Mizoram. In addition, two big infrastructure project viz. Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project(KMMTTP), Barabi-Sairang-Hmawngbuchhuah railway line being implemented in Mizoram under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners across Mizoram from Myanmar and would also encourage illegal criminal activities across the border.
