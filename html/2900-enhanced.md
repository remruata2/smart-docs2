The Mizoram Police are regarded as one of the finest in India. Various units such as DEF, CID, DSB or Traffic Police are all considered Mizoram Police as a whole. However, if the head of each unit consider the inter unit competition/rivalry too seriously, it can hamper the works and investigation of the Police Department. To have an optimum result, good co-operation and putting aside the attitude of selfishness is required, especially in the changing world, where criminals are more advance and the Police need to be one step ahead of them.
