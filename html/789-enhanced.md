****WRITE UP ON ARAKAN ARMY****

 The**Arakan Army**is aRakhineinsurgent groupinMyanmar(Burma), founded on the 10th April 2009.It is the armed wing of theUnited League of Arakan(ULA) and is currently ledby Major GeneralTwan Mrat Naing. The purpose of the AA is to protect Arakan people and to establish peace, justice, freedom and development.

 The AA is a participant in theKachin conflict, fighting alongside theKachin Independence Army(KIA) against theTatmadaw(Myanmar Armed Forces). Most AA soldiers were originally trained at the KIA Military Academy; however, the AA has additional training camps inRakhine State. According to the Myanmar Peace Monitor, the AA had more than 1,500 troops in 2014, including personnel stationed in the Rakhine State near Myanmar's border with Bangladesh._The Irrawaddy_(A website by the Irrawaddy Publishing Group founded in 1990) has stated that, as of September 2015, the AA has 2,500 troops and 10,000 supporters

 The Arakan Army (AA) was founded on 10 April 2009 along with its political wing, theUnited League of Arakan(ULA), in what it describes as its "temporary headquarters" in Laiza, Kachin State.The group has stated that it advocates for:

1. self-determination for the multi-ethnic Arakanese population.

1. the safeguarding and promotion of the national identity and cultural heritage of the Arakan people.
2. the "national dignity" and best interests of the Arakan people.

Following training, the group had planned to return to Arakan State and fight for self-determination; however, with the outbreak of fighting in Kachin State in June 2011, they were unable to return. As a result, they took up arms against the Myanmar Army in support of the KIA. In 2014, the AA started a settlement in Rakhine State (home land) near the border withBangladeshand another near the border of Thai-Myanmar with which it has become much stronger and its combat abilities have been positively impacted.

There are reports of Myanmar Army intensifying military offensive against Arakan Army in Paletwa since recent weeks, but there is no immediate possibility of refugee entering into Mizoram as the fighting takes place deep inside Paletwa.
