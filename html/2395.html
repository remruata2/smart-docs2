Elles, Assistant Quarter Master General in his book &ldquo;Military Report on the Chin-Lushai Country&rdquo; (pp.27) are as follows:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&quot;The Boundary line extended from a few miles above Lakhipur on the Barak to the northern limits of Hill Tiporrah, passing through the southern extremity of Chuttachurra Range, and the Lushai had been warned that any depredation committed on the British side of this line would be seriously punished.&quot;</span></span></span></span></p>

This was resented by the Lushais who made formal protest to the British in 1865. This fact was recorded by Mr. Mackenzie as follow</span></span><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">s: </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Vanpuilala&rsquo;s (one the Lushai Chiefs) messengers expressed great dread of the advance of the tea gardens up the Sonai, which Capt.

A chain of Military outposts was established along the line at Mynadhar, Monierkhal, Nudigram, Newarband, Jalnachurra and chhuttachura. The line was also known as Ronphari which means &quot;battle or patrol line.&quot;In 1870 the British prohibited all their subjects, including the natives, from crossing this newline of control.</span></span> <span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">In 1870-71 Mr. Edgar tried to make a new boundary line which was not accepted by the Lushai chiefs.</span></span><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> In </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">1871</span></span><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">,</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> a series of successful concerted raids were launched by the Lushais One British citizen James Winchester was also killed and his daughter Merry Winchester was taken captive by the Lushais.</span></span> <span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The British took retaliatory measures by sending expeditionary forces into Lushai Hills and had to be contented to limit their actual line of control on the line drawn in 1867.</span></span> <span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">ln 1873 the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation Was made and under the Regulation the Cachar Inner Line was notified in 1875 following more or less the line drawn in 1867 or the Ronphari.</span></span> <span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The British subjects were not allowed to go beyond this line without written permission of the District Officer of Cachar.</span></span> <span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">This line was established as the boundary between the Lushai Territory and the Cachar District of British India.</span></span></span></span></p>
