**HISTORY OF BRUS IN MIZORAM AND THEIR MILITANTS**

 The Brus also called Reangs are the Nomadic Tribe living in the western belt of Mizoram, bordering Bangladesh and Tripura State. The Brus started entering into Mizoram in around 1940's. The Brus were living in Kolasib District, Lunglei District and Mamit District.

 A militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) formed in 1996, killed Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary on 21.10.1997 and two of his friends were also abducted. This killing ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by Bru National Union (BNU) and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram towards Tripura.

 The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps and were also given free rations and other essential commodities

 The Centre and the State authorities fixed the date for repatriation of the Bru refugees for 16th November, 2009. While all preparations for repatriation process were going on smoothly a Bru militant group,Bru Revolutionary Union (BRU) killed a Mizo youth Zarzokima (17), on 13th November, 2009. It was later confirmed that killing was done deliberately by the BRU in order to deter the repatriation process.

 Different armed groups which were formed by the Brus - BNA/BRA, BNLF or BLFM and BNCT are not active anymore. However, one group, Bru Democratic Front of Mizoram (BDFM) was again formed under the patronage of NLFT. These BDFM cadres are the remnants of the then BLFM who refused to surrender at the time of the latter's mass surrender on 26.10.2006.
