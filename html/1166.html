However, communities represented by the Hmar People Convention(Democratic) in the Northeast and Northwest of Mizoram bordering Manipur and Assam states and Bru National Development Liberation Front of Mizoram representing the Bru communities in the Southwest and western belt of Mizoram bordering Bangladesh and Tripura have been indulging in criminal activities. The recent glaring example felt in the Inter-State and International border areas recently was HPC-D, a Manipur based militant group of Hmar community who summoned four village leaders of Sakawrdai village(Mizoram-Manipur border) by the S/S Army Chief of HPC(D) in the first week of October, 2013 at a location near Patpuihmun village, Manipur giving diktat that no individual, NGO or political parties within Sinlung Hills Development Council area should undertake any activity for the ensuing Mizoram General Election and they should co-operate with cadres of HPC(D) who are being sent to infiltrate into various villages within the HPC(D) demand area and to convey a message to the Govt. of Mizoram that the HPC(D) strongly resented the Government&#39;s attitude for non-resumption of peace talk and also the kidnapping of 5 Forest Muster Roll workers and 3 Gautam Construction Company workers at the Indo-Bangla border by Tripura based militant groups, i.e. NLFT &amp; Bru militant group.</span></span></span></p>

These underground groups have particularly been involved in Abduction/Kidnapping/Extortion cases in all the three assembly constituencies viz Hachhek, Dampa and Mamit within Mamit District during the last 4-5 years.&nbsp; The latest being the recent abduction of 5 Forest Muster Roll workers and 3 Gautam Construction Company workers in the month of June, 2013 at the Indo-Bangla border by Tripura based militant groups, i.e. NLFT &amp; Bru militant group.</span></span></span></p>

However, the recent abduction/kidnapping/extortion cases reported especially on the western side of the district bordering Bangladesh and Tripura coupled with the presence of anti-repatriation elements amongst Bru electors warranted some of the polling stations within the three constituencies of Mamit district to be declared as&nbsp; critical in the context of election.</span></span></span></p>

In East Tuipui constituency, five (5) polling stations namely: Vaphai-I,&nbsp; Vaphai-II, Saikhumphai, Farkawn-I and Farkawn-II are identified as most critical due to t<span style="color:black">he incident at Saikhumphai on </span>29.4.2013 and the subsequent <span style="color:black">major law and order problem in regard to the question of illegal settlement of Saikhumphai settlers and the persistent friction between Farkawn and Vaphai. </span></span></span></span></p>
