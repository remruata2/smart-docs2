No. MSB/CB/SR/2021/188

Dated: 16th March, 2021

MPCC called a Press Conference today, i.e., 16.3.2021 @ 2:00 p.m. at Aizawl Press Club under the guidance of Dr. Lallianchhunga, Media Chairman and 17 (seventeen) persons including 12 (twelve) media persons were present. A Press Statement was issued which stated that an unfortunate incident occurred yesterday in the ongoing Mizoram Legislative Assembly Budget Session wherein an argument/debate inside the House did not end there and continued even outside the House and there was even an attempt of resorting to physical assault. It stated that Pu Ngunlianchunga, MLA, spoke out in the House about Pu TJ Lalnuntluanga, Law Minister's statement, which has been widely circulated in newspapers on 2.6.2020, wherein the latter stated that he believes the reason for being safe from Covid-19 is due to having a God fearing Chief Minister. The Minister interrupted and reacted disrespectfully by demanding for his voice record and even tried to physically assault the MLA even outside the Assembly House. The Press Statement alleged that to try to backtrack from his statement which was widely circulated and broadcasted in media shows the Minister's lack of respect for the Assembly House, MsLA and media persons. It further pointed out that if the Minister do not offer personal apology to Pu Ngunlianchunga and make a public statement about his apology before the end of today, i.e., 16.3.2021, Congress party will take action as deemed fit to stand up for their MLA.

MPYCC also issued a Press Release on the above lines today wherein it demanded Pu TJ Lalnuntluanga, Law Minister, to offer an apology to Pu Ngunlianchunga, MLA and to the people. It also stated that the Minister's insistence for evidence on his own statement is an indication of his lack of faith upon MNF Party Press Release.

Pu Joseph Lalhimpuia, General Secretary, MPCC, i/c GAD submitted a letter in the name of MPCC to Hon'ble Minister, Law &amp; Judicial, Parliamentary Affairs, Transport, etc. today informing the Minister about the demands of MPCC as pointed out in today's Press Conference as well as the demand of MPYCC and supplying a copy of both the Press Statement and Press Release.
