No. MSB/CB/B-114/2010/   Dated Aizawl, the Jan., 2012

To,

 The Director General of Police,

 Mizoram

Subject: Resumption of Peace Talk with HPC(D)-Reg.

Ref: No.D-32020/21/2010-HMS Government of Mizoram, Home Department.

Sir,

 With reference to the above cited letter and a copy forwarded to this office, I have the honour to submit real time assessment of the situation obtaining the latest conditions of HPC(D) within SHDC Area and Manipur-Mizoram border area.

 HPC(D) Executive Council Meeting held on dt. 29.9.2011 impeached their acting president Lalhmingthanga Sanate from his post. This resulted in split of HPC(D) into two factions. Army Chief Ropuia and Gen. Secy. Sangbera's faction(Ropuia-Sangbera's faction) claims itself as the original party of the HPC(D). Some majority leaders join Ropuia-Sangbera's faction who have more cadres, arms and SoO(Suspension of Operation) agreement.

 In the meantime, information was received that the other faction led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate claimed to have more supporters among Hmar People and had setup a camp at Saikot(Churachanpur). He also collected 20-30 arms and recruited some cadres with the help of KNO(Kuki National Organisation). Lalhmingthanga Sanate's faction is trying to help the present RJD MLA Sanglura whereas Ropuia-Sangbera's faction is trying to support Dr.Chaltawnliana(Congress candidate) in the coming Manipur State election.

 After the split of HPC(D) into two factions, both the factions did not make any major untoward incidents in Mizoram but they resort to demanding money from some contractors and NREGS's money from Village Council(VC). Information received indicated that on 20th December 2011(Tuesday), Lalhmingthanga's faction demanded 3-4% working bill of Vodafone Company who is working at optical fibre-fitting between Ratu village and New Vervek village. Vodafone company has been facing troubles as the same demand had been already given to them by the other faction i.e. Ropuia-Sangbera's faction.

 While there has been a grave rivalry between the two factions and while it is difficult even to decide which faction is to be considered the original one, two residents of Sakawrdai, namely; Lalneihthanga and Thanglianchhunga representing all political parties of the town met Home Secretary and Joint Secretary, MHA(NE Region) in New Delhi on 22.12.2011 seeking way for another peace talk between the Govt. of Mizoram and HPC(D). However, response of the MHA is yet to be known.

 In view of the above holding a meaningful dialogue with HPC(D) at this stage may not be conducive until and unless SoO(Suspension of Operation) being enforced upon HPC(D) is strictly regulated and monitored by concerned authorities and at the same time all cadres of HPC(D) should follow the SoO agreement with letter and spirit.

Yours faithfully,

Superintendent of Police
