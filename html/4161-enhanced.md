**Para 17. Border Management and Foreigner Monitoring**

_(a) The FMR guidelines 2018 should be strictly enforced by concerned DEF and CID(SB) -_

 Although strict enforcement of FMR Guidelines along the Indo(Mizoram) Myanmar border areas is not easy at the moment in view of the State Government's policy against Myanmar Nationals seeking asylum in Mizoram, Sector Officers of CID(SB), who are posted along the Indo Myanmar areas are instructed to enforced the FMR guidelines 2018 tactfully especially towards any Myanmar Nationals who are suspected to be involved in illegal activities and may take advantages of the FMR on the present situation.

 Presently, the refugees entering Mizoram from neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh due to the political turmoil in their countries are rehabilitated in the various camps inside Mizoram. The illegal immigrants from Myanmar and Bangladesh, though temporary in nature, are closely monitored by CID(SB) in collaboration with the local and district Authorities. As of 02.02.2024, the illegal immigrants (refugees) from Myanmar are staying in the following camps :

 Regarding fake Indian IDs or real Indian IDs, procured through illegal means, CID(SB) has been playing a pro active role. Two enquiries had been conducted by CID(SB) in alleged procurement of illegal Indian IDs.

 One of the enquiry revealed that one Myanmar National had acquired Indian Voters ID (EPIC Card) which was eventually surrendered by the defaulter after being exposed.

 The other enquiry revealed that PAN Cards and Aadhar Cards were procured through illegal means in Aizawl and other places. In this connection, a case vide Kawnpui PS Case Number 13/23 dated 15.06.2023 under section 468/180 (B) IPC r/w 14 Foreigners Act was registered which was later re-registered by Crime and Economic Offences Wing Police station as C&amp;EO PS Case Number 14/23 dated 30.08.2023 u/s 468/120 (b) IPC r/w 14 Foreigners Act. Investigation of the case had led to the arrest of 6(six) accused persons.

**27. Drugs Smuggling :** _Efforts to check drugs smuggling at international border and through Mizoram should be intensified for maximum seizures by employing new techniques and surveillance tools. Financial investigation of drugs smugglers should always be done so as to financially cripple the smugglers-_

__1. CID (SB) has been playing a significant role in prevention and seizure of smuggled narcotic drugs in the past. From 22nd January 2024 till date, staff of CID(SB) had conducted four large scale operations to recover/seize various contraband items smuggled inside or through Mizoram state. Although all the said operations were not successful, 36 grams of Heroin, which was estimated to be worth â‚¹ 1,08,000 was seized on 1.2.2024 with a case being registered vide Spl. Narcotics PS C/No.5/24 dated 1.2.2024 u/s21(b) NDPS Act.
