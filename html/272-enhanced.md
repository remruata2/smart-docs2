Subject: Assessment of threat perception in respect of Pu H. Rohluna, MLA/Candidate, INC, Lengteng Constituency.

Sir,

  With reference to subject cited above, threat assessment in respect of MLA and Candidate of Lengteng Constituency Pu H. Rohluna had been conducted and ascertained that some of the villages in Lengteng Constituency are sensitive area and some are the border of Myanmar and Manipur State, and some insurgent group i.e. ZRO/ZRA from other states may disturb him during his tour of election campaign.

 It is, therefore, suggested that additional PSO armed with sophisticated weapon may be provided at the earliest.

Yours faithfully,
