 With reference to your letter no and the subject cited above, I am hereby submitting comments on the following information sought by Lalfamkima, Chaltlang Dingdi Veng through RTI.

** **‘As often described by the politicians, Does the state police department regard Mizoram as Island of peace or the most peaceful state in India'****

 **Comments:**

 In term of Insurgency related incidents, Mizoram can undoubtedly be regarded as one of the most peaceful state in India.

 The 20-year long insurgency in Mizoram (1966-86) led by the Mizo National Front (MNF) was resolved way back in 1986. However, after the end of 20-year insurgency of Mizoram some armed groups of Hmars i.e Hmar People’s Convention (HPC) and armed group of Brus (Reang) i.e Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF), Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram(BLFM) took armed struggle movement in Mizoram undermining the peaceful atmosphere of the state of Mizoram.

 A peace accord was signed way back on 27.7.1994 between Government of Mizoram and HPC, However, certain groups of persons who are disgruntled with the accord formed Hmar People’s Convention(Democratic) i.e HPC(D) in 1996. The HPC-D continues to carry out their criminal activities like killing of security personnel, abduction, collecting donations, extortion, intimidation within Mizoram (along Mizoram – Manipur border). They operated from the state of Manipur. However, due to strong counter measure taken by Mizoram Police, most of the top leaders of HPC-D had already been arrested and are being incarcerated in Central Jail, Aizawl.

To end the Bru militant activities, the Government of Mizoram initiated Peace Talk with leaders of Bru militants, MoU was signed between BNLF and Government of Mizoram on 26.4.2005 and 804 strong members of BLFM also surrendered before the government on 26.10.2006 with their arms and ammunition.

As of now i.e 2016, the state of Mizoram is by and large remain peaceful and it may be mentioned that no Indian Insurgent Groups(IIG) are having bases inside the territory of Mizoram.

Submitted for favour of kind information and necessary action.

Yours faithfully,
