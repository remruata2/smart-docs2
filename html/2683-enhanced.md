Sir,

 With reference to the letter nos. cited above, enquiry was conducted in connection with the judgement order of the Supreme Court regarding the dispute between UPC (NEI) and Mizoram - UPC.

 During the enquiry, no implication of Law &amp; Order situation, which may arise between the two parties as a result of the said judgement was perceived as information received from reliable source indicated the intention of Mizoram - UPC side to vacate and hand over all the disputed properties to UPC (NEI) without further objection as soon as an Execution Order from the Court in this regard is received by them.

 Submitted for kind information and further necessary action, please.

Yours faithfully,
