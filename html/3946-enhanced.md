****Report on HPO–CNDF Clashes in Chin State, Myanmar (July 2–7, 2025)****

****Executive Summary****

Between July 2 and July 5, 2025, intense armed clashes occurred in Falam District, Chin State, Myanmar, between the Chin National Defense Force (CNDF) and the Hualngoram People’s Organization (HPO). The conflict arose from unresolved disputes over administrative control, taxation, and education authority following a failed joint meeting on May 18, 2025. The violence led to significant territorial losses for HPO, mass civilian displacement, and one civilian fatality. By July 5, CNDF had captured all HPO-controlled areas, prompting over 2,500 residents to seek refuge in Zokhawthar, India. Peace negotiations initiated in Aizawl on July 5 show cautious progress but are complicated by the involvement of external armed groups, notably the Chin National Army (CNA). This report provides a detailed account of the events, humanitarian impacts, security responses, and ongoing peace efforts.

**Background**

The conflict stemmed from a dispute over administrative authority in Falam District, particularly in the Hualngoram area. On May 18, 2025, a joint meeting at Kawt Sei sought to address disagreements concerning education, taxation, and licensing authority, all administered by HPO. Citing the Chinland Constitution, HPO claimed the right to establish a regional government in Hualngoram with full administrative control. The Chin National Organization (CNO), aligned with CNDF, contested this, asserting that all administrative matters in Falam District fall under CNO jurisdiction. The failure of the May 18 meeting heightened tensions, leading to armed hostilities.

**Peace Initiatives**

 A peace meeting was held on dated 05.07.2025 at 3:30 PM at Aizawl, organized by Advocacy for Mizoram.

Participants –

HPO: Four representatives, led by former president Lalthanzauva.

CNDF: Two delegates, led by President Ngunthawna.

The meeting addressed territorial disputes in Hualngoram, located within CNDF’s Falam District but under HPO influence. CNDF emphasized its jurisdictional claim, while HPO highlighted the complicating presence of CNA forces in Hualngoram. CNDF raised concerns about CNA activities undermining their authority. HPO clarified that CNA forces, supporting operations against Myanmar’s junta, were beyond their control. CNDF proposed that CNA withdrawal from Hualngoram would allow HPO to maintain administrative structures without CNDF interference.

_Outcomes :_ Both parties agreed to continue dialogue to prevent further displacement and bloodshed. A follow-up meeting at 7:30 PM at the CYMA office in Aizawl discussed de-escalation measures, resulting in an agreement to reduce hostilities.

**Official Visits and Developments**

 On July 6, 2025, the Deputy Inspector General of the Assam Rifles visited Zokhawthar. Pu Lalmuanpuia Punte, MLA and Adviser to the Chief Minister, accompanied by three advocacy members, visited Zokhawthar and proceeded to Khawmawi, spending approximately 30 minutes before returning to Champhai.

**Conclusion**

The HPO–CNDF clashes in Falam District from July 2 to July 5, 2025, resulted in significant territorial shifts, mass displacement, and one civilian fatality. The CNA’s capture of CNDF’s headquarter camp Rihli on July 6 and the subsequent CNDF counter offensive on July 7 further complicated the conflict dynamics. Humanitarian efforts in Zokhawthar, Vaphai, and Saikhumphai have provided critical support to displaced populations, while security measures have aimed to prevent spillover into India. Peace talks in Aizawl show potential for resolution, but the presence of external armed groups like the CNA continues to pose challenges. Sustained dialogue and de-escalation efforts are critical to stabilizing the region and addressing the humanitarian crisis.
