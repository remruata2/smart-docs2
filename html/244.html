Residence Commissioner having two PSOs. It is known that unforeseen communal tension between Mizoram state and Assam state occasionally flared up in the past recent years. Though peace between the two states has been retained at present, the said official&rsquo;s intervention in the activities of NGOs and other criminals was often needed. Moreover, the said official often needed to travel in and out of the two states- Mizoram and Assam since their office used to do Bank Transaction only at Treasury Office, Kolasib, Mizoram which is hectic for only one PSO. Therefore it is considered that the said official be continued to provide with two PSOs.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

Apart from this, the underground outfit, HPC(D) who often posed threats for him had recently signed MoS with the Government of Mizoram and his previous direct/indirect intimidations from the said outfit&nbsp; no longer exist as of now. Because of these factors, it is no longer necessary to provide him with PSO and House Guard as he himself also felt it unnecessary for the continuation of such securities.</span></span></span></span></p>
