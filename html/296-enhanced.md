No.MSB/CB/B-19(A)/ Dated Aizawl,the Oct.,2019.

To

 The Asst. Inspector General of Police (Hqrs.)

 Mizoram, Aizawl.

Subj :- Provision of PSO - reg.

Ref :- No.E/PHQ/SEC/1/101 dt.21.10.2019.

Sir,

 In compliance to your letter no. mentioned above, enquiry to assess threat perception in respect of CJM, Siaha was duly conducted.

 During the course of enquiry, it was ascertained that, presently, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Siaha is not provided with PSO of any kind and he is the only CJM in the state who is not provided with any. However, being a CJM, his work nature requires dealing of different criminal cases where the local population is made up of various ethnic groups spreading across an international border. As such, considering the above circumstances, provision of PSO to CJM, Siaha may be suggested so as to enable him to discharge his duties fairly and in confidence.

 Submitted for favour of information and further necessary action please.

Yours faithfully,

**(K.LALREMSANGA)**
