****KUKI CHIN NATIONAL FRONT (KNF)****

 This organisation was founded in the year 2008 by elements of Zo- ethnic living in Bangladesh as Kuki-Chin National Development Organisation (KNDO).

 Two years after its establishment,leaders of this organisation sought assistance from Kachin National Army (KNA), a militant outfit operating in Myanmar, for training which resulted in about 20-40 KNDO cadres receiving training from KNA during the year 2017-2020. After these cadres completed their training, their organisation was renamed as Kuki Chin National Front (KNF).

 The main objective of this organisation is to unite Zo-ethnic tribes including CHIN tribes living in Myanmar - Bangladesh bordering areas into one autonomous region having a development budget of their own from Bangladesh Government.

 It may also be mentioned that, after the completion of their training under KNA, cadres of KNF did not take any Arms and Ammunitions with them as this could hamper their safe return journey home to Bangladesh.

 Leaders of Kuki-Chin National Front from Bangladesh frequently visited Mizoram where they often met leaders of PAMRA and even Government officials whenever necessary. Some of them even proceeded up to Myanmar during these visits.
