****Shortage of Petroleum Oil in Mizoram:******A massive landslide in Meghalaya, floods in Assam and damages of railway tracks due to the recent heavy rainfall still hampers the supply of petroleum oil inside the state.**

 Speaking about this, Pu K.Lalnghakliana, President, All Mizoram Petroleum Dealers Association (AMPEDA) expressed how the railway tracks between Silchar and Guwahati remained unrepaired after they were damaged which in turn hinders the transportation of sufficient oil to Mizoram. The present oil depot of Vairengte, which was constructed 30 years ago, is only a mini oil depot whose capacity is not sufficient. However, when the proposed oil depot at Sairang town by Oil India Corporation is completed ,demands in oil may be met to a great extend, he further added.
