****i)** **Security scenario in Barak Valley (Assam) and Mizoram, particularly areas bordering with Bangladesh**: The security scenario of the western part of Mizoram bordering with Bangladesh is comparatively peaceful. However, due to the occasional incident of kidnappings/abduction occurred in the border areas because of the porousness of the Indo-Bangladesh border required more attention. The border between Mizoram and Bangladesh, especially Mamit District side of Mizoram and Bangladesh, deserves special attention in and around Dampa Wildlife Sanctuary Abduction cases have had occured in which 5 (five) persons have been abducted by NLFT on the month of Feb.2013. Subsequently, 3(persons) have been abducted by the combined team of NLFT and BDFM in the later part of the same year, out of which 2 Mizos have been released on 20.01.2014 and then Deep Mandal, Airtel Surveyor was also released on 22.3.2014.
