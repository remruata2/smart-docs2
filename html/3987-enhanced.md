****Subject: Visits of K. Vanlalvena, MP to Myanmar - Report and Concerns****

**Sir,**

I am writing to bring to your immediate attention the visits of Shri K. Vanlalvena, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha), to Myanmar, particularly his engagements with armed rebel groups and local administrations in the Chin State and Rakhine regions. These visits, while ostensibly aimed at addressing developmental and humanitarian concerns, raise significant security and diplomatic concerns that warrant thorough scrutiny.

**Background and Context**

Shri K. Vanlalvena, the lone Rajya Sabha MP from Mizoram, has made multiple visits to Myanmar over the past year, engaging with non-state actors such as the Arakan Army (AA) and the Chinland Council/Chin National Front (CNF). These visits have been widely reported in local and national media, highlighting his involvement in discussions related to the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project, refugee issues, and the broader political dynamics in Myanmar.
**Key Visits and Engagements.**

1. **Visit to Arakan Army (29th February, 2024)**

  On 29th February 2024, Shri K. Vanlalvena, accompanied by leaders of the Central Young Lai Association (CYLA) and members of the Lai Autonomous District Council (LADC), crossed into Myanmar and met with the Arakan Army.

  The delegations were taken 12 kilometres inside Myanmar, where they inspected the Kaladan road corridor, which is a critical component of India’s connectivity project with Southeast Asia.

  The Arakan Army, a rebel group fighting for autonomy in Rakhine State, provided security to the delegation during the visit.

  Discussions reportedly focused on the stalled progress of the Kaladan project on the Myanmar side, as well as the refugee crisis caused by the ongoing conflict in Myanmar.

2. **Visit to Chinland Council and Camp Victoria (27th February, 2025)**

  On 27th February 2025, Shri K. Vanlalvena visited Camp Victoria, the military stronghold of the Chin National Front (CNF) and the headquarters of the Chinland Council.
  He met with Chinland Council leaders, including their Chief Minister Pu Pathanga, and urged unity among Chin resistance groups, emphasizing the need for dialogue over armed conflict.
  During his visit, he was accorded a guard of honour by Chinland soldiers and toured various facilities within the camp.

3. **Engagement at Khawmawi Village (28th February, 2025)**

  On 28th February 2025, the MP visited Khawmawi village in Chin State, near Mizoram’s Zokhawthar village, where he interacted with leaders of the Hualngoram People’s Organisation (HPO).

  He made controversial remarks about the Tiau river not being a legitimate boundary for the ‘Zofate’ (ethnic Mizos) and suggested that the Indian Government should consider fencing the border along the Chindwin river instead.

**Concerns and Implications**

**1. **Engagement with Non-State Actors****

  Shri K. Vanlalvena’s interactions with armed rebel groups like the Arakan Army and the Chin National Front raise serious concerns about India’s diplomatic stance and adherence to international norms. Engaging with non-state actors, especially those involved in armed conflict against a recognized government, could complicate India’s relations with Myanmar and other ASEAN nations.

2. **Security Risks**

  The MP’s visits to conflict zones in Myanmar, accompanied by local leaders and activists, expose him and his delegation to significant security risks. The involvement of armed groups in providing security further blurs the lines between official and unofficial engagements.
3. **Border Sensitivity**

  His remarks about the Tiau river not being a legitimate boundary and his advocacy for extending the ‘Zofate’ boundary to the Chindwin river could inflame sentiments on both sides of the border. Such statements may also undermine India’s official border policy and create unnecessary tensions.

4. **Impact on Kaladan Project**

  While the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project is of strategic importance to India, the MP’s engagements with rebel groups controlling parts of the project area could jeopardize its implementation. The involvement of non-state actors in discussions about the project raises questions about its legal and operational viability.
5. **Refugee Crisis**

  While addressing the refugee crisis is a humanitarian concern, the MP’s approach of engaging with rebel groups rather than working through official channels could complicate efforts to manage the influx of refugees into Mizoram.

**Conclusion**

While Shri K. Vanlalvena’s efforts to address developmental and humanitarian issues in the region are commendable, his frequent visits to Myanmar and engagements with armed rebel groups raise significant concerns that cannot be overlooked.
Submitted for kind information.

Yours faithfully,
