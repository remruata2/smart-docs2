No.MSB/CB/SR/2020/066

Dated: 3rd February, 2020.

 Reference to our Special Report dated 31.1.2020 a Press Conference jointly called by Mizo Students Union (MSU) and Aizawl City College Joint Students Union (ACCJSU) was held today, i.e 3.2.2020 @ 1:00 p.m at Aizawl Press Club in which the MSU/ACCJSU leaders told pressmen about their resentment citing the circumstances which led to the incident of vandalism of Chakma House on 28.09. 2017. In a joint Press Statement issued today, the MSU/ACCJSU resented the non-withdrawal of FIR by Liaison Officer of Chakma House which they thought had already been settled courtesy of initiatives by Pu C. Ngunlianchunga, former MoS, and in presence of Dr. BD Chakma, MLA, Pu Adikanta Tongchongya, MDC, as well as other Chakma NGO leaders. Copies of previous memorandum of understanding and cooperation between MSU and Chakma leaders purportedly made consequent to their meeting at Pu C. Ngunlianchunga's office was also distributed during the Press Conference. MSU also quoted former SP Aizawl as having assured them that the case would be resolved. Urging the Government to take step towards withdrawal of pending cases against them, MSU/ACCJSU in their Press Statement further stated that they would not allow Chakma House to open from 4.2.2020 as well as continue the on-going construction of Students' Hostel.

 Consequent to this, the LO of Chakma House had tendered withdrawal of the Vaivakawn PS Case No. 146/2017 dt. 28.09.2017 u/s 448/342/427/506 IPC later in the afternoon which was pursued in the CJM's Court. It is reported that besides the case mentioned above there is yet another similar case of vandalism of NIT Office on 26.07. 2018 vide Bawngkawn PS Case No. 175/18 dt. 26.07.2018 u/s 448/506/427/34 IPC still pending against MSU/ACCJSU leaders. Student leaders demanded withdrawal of this case as well pursuant to the undertaking purportedly signed earlier by Dr. Bijayananda Mohanty, Asst. Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, NIT, Aizawl dated 22.11.2019, copies of which were also distributed during the press conference. Accordingly, Dr. Lalthanchami, Registrar, NIT had also tendered withdrawal of the case in the concerned Court later today.

 Petitions for withdrawal of both the cases mentioned above having been submitted by the complainants, MSU/ACCJSU awaited the Courts' decision till 6:00 p.m and since withdrawal of the cases was not considered by the Court, i.e. Judicial Magistrate First Class till late this evening they decided to go ahead with their proposed diktat to be imposed on Chakma House and Hostel construction. The MSU/ACCJSU accordingly notified college students within Aizawl City to assemble in front of Vanapa Hall tomorrow i.e. 4.2.2020 @ 10:30 a.m and if there is no positive response from the concerned Courts they would carry out procession. Information received indicated that there is a strong possibility of the students marching towards Chakma House.

 Situation is under close watch.
