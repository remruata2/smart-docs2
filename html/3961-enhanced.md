2. (1). **Turmoil in Bangladesh, causes, present situation and way forward**:

Bangladesh is currently experiencing significant political turmoil. The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has banned the Awami League, the party of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, under an anti-terrorism law. This move has been denounced by the Awami League as "fascist" and illegal.

Yunus, who has been facing pressure from various political parties, has threatened to resign if parties don't support him. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has asked Yunus to hold elections by December 2025, while Jamaat-e-Islami has suggested possible poll timeframes.

The country's Election Commission is awaiting a formal notification from the government to decide on scrapping the Awami League's registration. This ban could disqualify the party from contesting the upcoming general election, scheduled to take place between December 2025 and June 2026.

Meanwhile, the Bangladesh army has been involved in talks with President Md Shahabuddin, fueling rumors of a potential constitutional overhaul. The situation remains volatile, with various political parties and student groups demanding elections and protesting against the interim government.

  The Indo-Bangladesh border in Mizoram Lawngtlai and Lunglei District are actively patrolled by the BSF and the activities along the border is closely monitored by the District Police.
