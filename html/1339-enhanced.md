****STATUS REPORT OF BRU REFUGEES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO BNLF/BLFM/BNA****

**BNLF (BRU NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT)**

****The Brus also called Riangs are the Nomadic Tribe living in the western belt of Mizoram, bordering Bangladesh and Tripura State. As far as history goes the Brus started entering into Mizoram around 1940's moving from one place to another for jhum cultivation.****

**Political awareness gradually emerged amongst the Brus and formed a political party called Riang Democratic Party in June, 1990. At the same time Bru Student Association and Bru Welfare Committee were also formed to promote the welfare of Brus in Mizoram. In 1994 the RDP, BSA and BWC at a joint conference formed a new political party called the Bru National Union(BNU) by merging the three organisations. The BNU conference held in September, 1997 at Saipuilui village in Mamit District adopted a resolution for creation of Autonomous District Council for Brus in the western part of Mizoram which was strongly objected by the Mizo community in the concerned area. At the same time a militant outfit called the Bru National Liberation Front(BNLF) which was formed in on 9.11.1996 under the Presidenship of Vanlalliana, Tuirum village in Mamit district became more and more active and on 21.10.1997 Lalzawmliana, Forest Game Watcher in Dampa Forest Sanctuary was killed and two of his friends were also abducted by the BNLF. The news about the killing had spread like wild fire throughout Mizoram and ignited the already tension in the area due to the demand of an Autonomous District Council by BNU. Tension between the two communities escalated and communal violence broke out and being lesser in numbers, the Bru people started fleeing Mizoram at the instance of the BNLF for their operational convenience.**

**The Bru people who fled Mizoram in the wake of the incident were given refugees status in Tripura. They were given shelter in six refugee camps and were also given free rations and other essential commodities at the rate fixed by the Union Government.**

****Later on, Govt. of Mizoram initiated peace talk with leaders of BNLF w.e.f. 7.9.2001 and after 12 rounds of peace talk between government of Mizoram and BNLF, MOU was signed between BNLF and Govt. of Mizoram on 26.4.2005. And in pursuance of MOU signed on 26.4.2005, the 195 strong BNLF cadres and their family members have been temporarily sheltered at Sidon Transit Camp, Tuipuibari. Altogether a total members of 950 including all BNLF cadres and families have been provided free ration at the rate of Rs.10/- per adult and Rs.5/- per minor per day.****

**Resettlement & Rehabilitation: Finally Govt. of Mizoram had resettled BNLF and their family members in four villages of Mamit district and one village of Lawngtlai district.**

**Govt. of Mizoram had sanctioned Rs. 50,000/- and Rs. 30,000/- as rehabilitation package and Housing Assistance respectively for each BNLF cadre from the fund received from central government.**

****These ex-BNLF cadres were issued ration card in their respective villages and also enrolled in the electoral roll and also issued Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) excepting those resettled in Tumpanglui. Schools under SSA Scheme were also opened particularly in Pathiantlang and Tumpanglui.****

**BLFM (BRU LIBERATION FRONT OF MIZORAM):**

**The Bru Liberation Front of Mizoram (BLFM) was formed in December 2001 at Naisingpara refugee camp reportedly at the instance of NLFT(BM) under the leadership of Vanlalliana, founder president of BNLF but overthrown by his men.**

**The first ever major activity launched by BLFM was kidnapping of one Maxi Cab driver Lalfamkima on 1.4.2003 for ransom. With the signing of memorandum of understanding(MOU) between BNLF and Govt. of Mizoram, the BLFM cadres were also expected to come overground and join the mainstream. Contrary to his hope, BLFM cadres further intensified their activities and resorted to forcible collection of donations from innocent civilians.**

****Surrender of 804 Strong Cadres of BLFM: Due to the arrest of their top leaders and surrender of 53 cadres of BLFM earlier, the remaining 804 strong members of BLFM have surrendered to the Govt. unconditionally and laid down their arms on 26.10.2006 and were temporarily sheltered in two transit camp - Damparengpui and Tuipuibari. Free ration have been provided under Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India.****
