**1. COLLECTION OF INTELLIGENCE ON ACTIVITIES OF FUNDAMENTALIST/EXTREMIST**

 The state of Mizoram has not witnessed any fundamentalist/extremist activities so far.

 The Tablighi Jamaat movement had found its way permeating the Muslim community in Mizoram since 1985. However, the Tablighi Jamaat devotees/enthusiasts since its inception has not dissociate themselves from the local mosque organisation nor do they refrain from participating in Muslim activities. It does not have any organisational structure or any permanent members in Mizoram.

 Tablighi Jamaat movement and activities is being closely monitored by assigning several officers and men of Field Branch and Technical Branch as well. Detail profile summary of Tablighi Jamaat devotees/enthusiasts is being maintained and updated.

 Tablighi Jamaat movement and activities is not seen as a potential threat which can endanger the security of the state nor do their involvement in any unlawful activities found till date.

**2. COLLECTION, COLLATION AND TIMELY DISSEMINATION OF INTELLIGENCE ON ALL RELEVANT SUBJECTS**

******The main responsibility and duty of CID(SB) is collection of intelligence pertaining to movement and activities of insurgents, contraband items smugglers, monitoring the activities of Political, Civil Society Organisations, student bodies, NGOs’, Government Employee Associations etc, whose activities could have a bearing on the security of the state as well as to the security of the nation.**

 Officers and men are assigned to closely monitor the activities of a particular organisation and garner informations on a daily basis. The raw informations garnered are collated and analysed by officers incharge of Field Branch after which it is timely passed on to the superior officers of the unit for further analysis and decision making.

 With regard to insurgents activities and smuggling of contraband items, selected officers are entrusted to deal with this ardous task which require high degree of professionalism though all Field Staffs are readied for any operational activity.

 Meticulous training and briefing are often imparted to Field Staffs as well as Sector office staffs in regard to collection of intelligence, report writing skills, handling of sources etc.

 For speedy and timely dissemination and sharing of intelligence inputs among SB Staffs, social media platform - whatsapp in particular, which is a secure means of communication is made good use of it.

**3. SWIFT DISPOSAL OF POLICE VERIFICATION OF PASSPORT**

******Initiative has been taken to reduce the time taken for Passport verification. On 1st November, 2019, a new system of Passport verification was introduced as desired by the DGP (M). In this new system, all verification process was done only by staffs of CID(SB) headquarter, Sector Officers posted at every District in Mizoram and verification of Passport applicants previously done by District SsP was discontinued.**

  Stoppage of the practices of dual verification i.e CID(SB) and District Executive Forces played a huge role in cutting down the time frame resulting in completion of Passport verification in 3 Days within Aizawl District and around 5 – 7 days at other Districts. Now, only CID(SB) Headquarters and its Sector Offices located in every Districts of Mizoram conducted passport verification and relieved District Executive Forces from their heavy workload which resulted in swift disposal of Police verification of Passport Application.

****As far as citizens of the North Eastern states in Mizoram are concerned, there has been no reports of any discrimination nor communal violence against them. At the same time, contacts of leaders of the organizations, formed by these groups based on their region of origin, such as - Assam Cultural Society, All Mizoram Manipuri Association etc. were obtained so as to enable prompt communication from them and vice versa in case of any possible crisis.

****8. IDENTIFICATION OF J&K STUDENTS FACING ANY KIND OF DIFFICULTY IN THE STATE AND GIVING ASSISTANCE TO THEM ACCORDINGLY****

  In the wake of the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A by the Indian Parliament on 5.8.2019 identification and locating students from J&amp;K was conducted as a step in preventing possible Law &amp; Order situation in the State.

  Among the various Institutions in Mizoram, the below mentioned were the only institutions which have students from J&amp;K in their enrolments -

**1) National Institute of Technology (NIT), Aizawl**

 The Institution has three (3) students from J&amp;K. The institution's authority and the said students were interacted with and it was found that no threats or intimidations were received by the students from J&amp;K. They were informed to report immediately to CID(SB) if such threat or intimidation were received.

**2) College of Veterinary and Sciences, Selesih, Mizoram**

 The Institution has five (5) students from J&amp;K. The institution's authority and the said students were also interacted with and it was found that no threats or intimidations were received by the students from J&amp;K. They were informed to report immediately to CID(SB) if such threat or intimidation was received.

 There has been no report on threat and intimidation to students of J&amp;K so far. It may be concluded from the above findings that the possibility of act of harassment is minimal in the State of Mizoram. However, it is suggested that all the educational Institutions may be instructed to report their students hailing from Jammu &amp; Kashmir to the higher authority at the beginning of each of their academic session. This may helps in identifying and assisting the students hailing from J&amp;K when facing any kind of sectarian/ethnical problems in the State.

**9. MATTER RELATING TO ROHINGYAS**

  The Rohingyas crisis has deepened due to the violent acts of the Muslim insurgent group acting under the banner of Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on 25th August, 2017. The subsequent offensive operation launched by Myanmar Army against this Muslim insurgents resulted in the death of hundreds of people and exodus of wave of Rohingyas from Rakhine State, Myanmar into the neighboring Bangladesh.

**  This has opened a new and complicated dimension to the already vexed issue of the Rohingyas. The vulnerability of the Rohingya migrants to radicalization from forces inimical to India can pose a security threat to the state of Mizoram. **As Mizoram shares a long porous border with both Myanmar and Bangladesh, further infiltration of Rohingyas migrants/refugees to India through the border of Mizoram must be prevented at all cost.****

 **Action taken for detection of illegal immigrants such as Rohingyas :**

****1)** Being Foreigners Registration office, CID(SB) has sent out Foreigners Registration Form to every entry and exit point within the state of Mizoram for identification of illegal immigrants. Police  personnel posted at the above mentioned points are also instructed to  check the authenticity of travel documents carried by foreigners  while entering or exiting Mizoram.**

**2)** To curb the ingress of illegal immigrants, Police personnel posted at the entry and exit points are instructed to check the authenticity of travel documents carried by foreigners while entering or exiting Mizoram and  to take prompt action in this regard. As a result of this, 8 (eight) Rohingyas were apprehended on 23.04.2019 while trying to enter Mizoram through Vairengte Police check gate.

****3)** Till today i.e, 30.4.2020,  no Rohingyas refugees from Rakhine State of Myanmar have taken shelter in any part of Mizoram. However, there were 32 illegal immigrants (ie, Rohingya) apprehended in the state of Mizoram. It may be mentioned that necessary action for their deportation process has already been initiated and instruction from Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi will be followed in dealing with them.**

**Suggested measures to be taken for prevention of illegal entry of Rohingyas :**

1. **Strengthening of Security and Intelligence Network:** Apart from strengthening Border Security Force (BSF) and Assam Rifles who are presently guarding the borders, it is also necessary to set-up new Police Stations/Out post (with the financial assistance of Central government) within these areas to act as a second layer for keeping effective watch on the infiltration of Rohingyas migrants and other cross border criminal activities.

1. **Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agencies and Intelligence agencies:** Mizoram Police and other agencies should be sensitized about Rohingyas' crisis so as to enable them to take prompt steps in identifying the illegal migrants and to initiate the process of deportation, etc. This could be achieved through Seminar, Workshop, etc.
