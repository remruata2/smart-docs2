****NOTES ON AGENDA POINTS FOR LIA MEETING, 1st July, 2025****

1. **Current political situation in Bangladesh, its likely impact in Indo-BD relation:**

_Inter-Group Clash Between PCJSS and UPDF(P) in Rangamati: One Dead, Several Injured :_

On the morning of 06 June at approximately 8:30 AM, a gunfire exchange occurred between the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) and the United People's Democratic Front (Progressive), UPDF(P) at Bangaltuli Union, Baghaichari Upazila, under Rangamati District.

During the incident, one UPDF(P) cadre was killed on the spot. Additionally, one AK-47 rifle was recovered by PCJSS personnel at the site. Two other members of the UPDF(P) sustained serious bullet injuries in the confrontation.

Tragically, a five-year-old child was also reported injured by gunfire allegedly fired by UPDF(P) during the exchange.

All PCJSS personnel involved in the operation withdrew safely following the incident. A contingent of the Bangladesh Army subsequently arrived at the location to verify and assess the situation.

Recently, the Lawngtlai border region has seen growing militant buildup, military encroachment, and cross-border alliances involving radical Islamist groups. With the establishment of fortified army camps and militant training zones across the border, the threat to Mizoram’s internal security, communal harmony, and national sovereignty has intensified. A strong, multi-layered response blending technology, border policing, community vigilance, and regional cooperation is urgently required to safeguard the region.

**II. **Security scenario in Mizoram with special reference to insurgency and smuggling**:**

**Insurgency :**

 Security scenario in Mizoram is mostly peaceful. However, with the influx of refugees into Mizoram due to the political condition in the neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh, some commercial activities are being exploited/used by these refugees to earn their living which is not welcomed by the local residents of Mizoram. Moreover, the refugees have started involving in criminal cases within Mizoram.

 Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and reorganized themselves during the year 2022. They have been indulging in collection of donation and extortion from the closing months of 2022. In this regard, 27 criminal cases have been registered in Mizoram against the cadres of Lalhmingthanga Sanate (HPCD) faction till date out of which 8 cases have been Charge-sheeted and 7 HPC(D) cadres arrested. However, no new activities of the HPC(D) is reported.

**Smuggling:**

Due to the peaceful nature and the geographical proximity of the state to the Death Triangle, Mizoram has been exploited as a safe route for smuggling of narcotics drugs. After the military coup in Myanmar on February, 2021, there has been an increase in the number of seizures of narcotics drugs in Mizoram possible either due to the funding of some ethnic armed groups by narcotic smugglers or the direct involvement of these armed groups in the smuggling activities to fund their operations. The ethnic conflict in the state of Manipur which started in the month of May, 2023 disallowed movement of goods including smuggled narcotics drugs across the state which further increases smuggling of narcotics through the state of Mizoram.

The modus operandi and ways of concealment of smuggled narcotics used by smugglers is constantly evolving. The past seizures of narcotics in the state revealed that these drugs are often concealed in sealed food packages, vegetables, electrical goods and more commonly inside a car door panel or costumed concealed compartment inside a vehicle.

Smuggling of explosives in the state is witnessed mainly after the military coup in Myanmar which could be attributed to the reported use of such explosives by ethnic armed groups to fight against the military junta. These smuggled explosives mainly consist of gelatin sticks and its detonators are illegally procured locally from some explosive licence holders who often gave out the explosives for mining purposes. The number of arms and ammunition seized in the state even though decreases in the last few months, the possibility of arms and ammunition smuggled across the state by some ethnic armed groups of Myanmar could not be ruled out due to the recent capturing of most of Myanmar Army camps in Chin and Rakhine state.

Further, the emerging trend of using end to end encrypted messaging applications and compartmentalizing activities like logistics, finances or intelligence gathering by different groups or units complicated the interception of modern narcotics syndicates.

III. **Conflict in Myanmar and its impact on Mizoram**:

**SAC Military Movements and Resistance –**

 As of June 2025, intense fighting continues in Chin State, Myanmar, between the State Administration Council (SAC) military forces and a coalition of resistance groups known as the Chin Brotherhood Alliance. This alliance includes the Chinland Defense Force (CDF), Chin National Defence Force (CNDF), and various local People's Defence Forces (PDFs) where Sizang PDF are participated as Majority. The SAC deployed approximately 600 troops aiming to advance into Chin State. However, their progress was halted near Mualpi, close to a coffee plantation, due to strong resistance from the Chin Brotherhood and allied forces. In retaliation, SAC forces reportedly burned down Mualpi Village in Tedim Township, leading to significant civilian displacement.

**Current Situation –**

 The resistance now controls a significant portion of Chin State, with the SAC's presence largely confined to isolated areas. Despite this, the SAC continues to conduct airstrikes in an attempt to regain lost territory. The situation remains fluid, with both sides preparing for potential escalations. The Chin Brotherhood Alliance continues to fortify its positions, while the SAC seeks to reclaim control through military offensives.
