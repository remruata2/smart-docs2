****NOTES ON SECURITY SCENERIO IN MIZORAM****

1. **Issues related with Myanmar******:

1. **Myanmar Refugee**:

1. _Brief history_ -

The arm resistance put up by the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) in general and armed ethnic groups of Chin State, Myanmar to overthrow the military regime in Myanmar since 1st February 2021 resulted in the influxes of considerable number of refugees particularly the Chin Community into Mizoram. Since the Military Coup, there has been a reported 8 (eight) major influxes of Myanmar Nationals into the State. Leaders of these ethnic groups held a workshop at Aizawl during 7th – 8th Sept.2023 in the goal of forming an interim Government at Chinland .

Apart from the Chin community, due to the arm clashes between the State Administration Council’s (SAC) Myanmar Army and Arakan Army in Rakhine State and the subsequent capturing of almost all important cities by the Arakan Army, some communities of Khumi tribe are also seeking shelter into the Southern part of Mizoram reportedly due to the atrocities of the Arakan Army.

 During the military operation conducted since 15.05.2024 by Chin National Army (CNA) led ethnic armed groups under Chinland Council against the State Administrative Council’s Myanmar Army and the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) Eastern Command camps inside Tonzang Township, the CNA led armed groups reportedly captured most of the camps allegedly occupied by Myanmar Army and ZRA Eastern Command including Dampui Camp (ZRA), Nakzaang Camp (Myanmar Army), Chikha Camp (Myanmar Army), Eliza Camp, Suansang (ZRA) and Tonzang Town Camp (Myanmar Army) on 19.05.2024. Till December 2024, the Chin Brotherhood Alliance had futher captured the Myanmar Army camps at Mindat, matupi, Kanpelet, Hakha and Thantlang town. During these clashes, the Myanmar Army retaliated by conducting airstrikes over Tonzang town, Nakzaang and Lungtak villages which led to desertion of these villages by the civilians. Some of these civilians who had left their villages and houses due to fear of another airstrikes by the Myanmar Army have entered the adjoining villages inside Mizoram for shelter and asylum.

1. **KMMTTP :**

The Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP) is a strategic infrastructure initiative by the GOI involving multimodal transport route combining land, river, and sea segments to link Northeast India with Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal. The route spans 882.21 km and comprises :

**Lawngtlai to Zorinpui (Mizoram)**: land route 87.51 kms.

**Zorinpui Border to Kaletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 45 kms.

**Kaletwa to Paletwa (Myanmar)**: land route 60.70 kms.

**Paletwa to Sittwe (Myanmar)**: 150 km river route.

**Sittwe to Kolkata Port (Bay of Bengal)**: 539 km sea route.

 As of June 2024, the KMMTTP land route construction within Mizoram is completed which however is occasionally hindered by landslides caused by heavy rainfall. In the meantime, due to the ongoing clashes in Myanmar, only around 10 kms earthwork between Zorinpui and Paletwa land route in Myanmar is executed by the assigned company for the project which is Myanmar New Power Construction Company.

The Arakan Army, comprising the major ethnic Arakanese in the Rakhine State of Myanmar has reportedly controlled most of Rakhine State including some parts of Chin State since February 2024 thereby controlling the proposed route of KMMTTP within Myanmar except Sittwe. However, with the ongoing clashes between the Myanmar Army and resistance forces in other parts of Myanmar, the Arakan Army as well as the civilians in Rakhine State heavily depended upon goods and petroleum oils transported through Mizoram mainly Lawngtlai and Siaha District. At the same time, the tension between the Arakan Army and the Chin ethnic armed groups in Myanmar led to the banning of transport of essential goods and petroleum oil into Myanmar by Central Young Lai Association (CYLA) which sided with their Chin brethren since April 2024. However, the banning of transportation of essential goods into Myanmar is now limited only to petroleum oil and fertilizers through Lawngtlai District.

1. **The Free Movement Regime along the Indo-Myanmar Border :**

_a)_****_Brief history :_

 The Free Movement Regime (FMR), is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar allowing citizens to travel freely within 16 km of the border for up to 72 hours without a visa. This initiative aims to maintain traditional ties and alleviate insecurity for tribals residing along the border. The FMR covers 1,629.5 km of unfenced border shared between four Indian states viz. Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram with Myanmar.

 In January 2018, the Union Cabinet approved a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance economic interactions through this regime. However, concerns have arisen about its misuse. The Ministry of Home Affairs reported that militants and criminals exploit the FMR to smuggle weapons, narcotics, and counterfeit currency, taking advantage of the regime's leniencies to cross borders and evade capture.

****_b) Enhancing Security and Mobility :_

 To address these issues, a committee led by the Special Secretary (Internal Security) was established in August 2017. The committee's mandate includes creating standardized procedures and guidelines for the FMR, delineating roles for central and state agencies, and developing a uniform Border Pass system. This pass will enable secure movement within the 16 km border area, with strict controls to prevent misuse.

The committee also plans to implement biometric cards for local residents and ensure that unauthorized vehicle crossings are prevented. The new measures are designed to balance the benefits of the FMR with enhanced security to safeguard both nations and their border communities.

Mizoram shares 510 kms long border with Myanmar which is unfenced and porous, Six Districts of the State share border with Myanmar. Out of the six Districts, Champhai shares the longest border with Myanmar.

****_c) Border Fencing and Free Movement Regime Abolition :_

 The Mizoram Assembly recently passed a resolution unanimously opposing the Indian government’s proposal to construct a fence along the Indo-Myanmar border and abolish the Free Movement Regime (FMR). Introduced by Home Minister K. Sapdanga, the resolution highlights concerns that these measures would adversely affect the Zo ethnic communities, historically divided by the border imposed during British colonial rule. The Assembly argues that reinforcing this division through new barriers would disrupt livelihoods and social ties of border communities.

_d) FMR New Guidelines (Free Movement Limit On Indo-Myanmar Border Tightened To 10 Km, With Border Pass) :_

The Indian government has implemented new measures to regulate movement across the Mizoram-Myanmar border, following a directive from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). On 24thDecember 2024, the MHA announced a new protocol that reduced the free movement regime (FMR) range from 16 km to 10 km. Although Union Home Minister Amit Shah had previously announced in February last year that the FMR would be scrapped, an official notification has yet to be issued.

Security along the 510-km border has been strengthened, and residents living within a 10-km radius on either side of the international border are now required to obtain a Border Pass for travel. The border pass, which allows a stay of up to seven days, is being issued to both Indian and Myanmar citizens who can provide documentation verifying their residence within the 10-km zone. This new rule, effective from December 31, is being enforced by State Police, Assam Rifles, and Health Officials at key entry and exit points. Individuals crossing the border will undergo document inspection by Assam Rifles, followed by security and health checks by local authorities. The Assam Rifles will record biometrics and issue a border pass that includes a QR code and photograph. Violations of the new movement rules will result in legal action, with physical checks in place to ensure compliance. The crossing points will operate from Monday to Saturday, between 6:00 am to 3:30 pm.

The new rules restrict movements of people from 16 km under the free movement regime (FMR) to 10 km now, on either side. Only those living in the "border area" - defined as within 10 km on either side - are eligible to apply for the "border pass" for a stay of up to seven days; the pass-holder has to return it at the same crossing point where it was issued. Those living in villages beyond the "border areas" (the 10-km zone) and citizens of any third nation cannot be issued the border pass.

 The border pass will be issued to only one adult, and minors (below 18 years old) have to be accompanied by parents. The details of a maximum number of three children can be captured in a single border pass belonging to either parent, another border pass is to be issued for more than three minors.

 The proof of identity can be issued by the station house officer of the local police station or an equivalent rank in Myanmar's case, and a local village chief or a village authority stating the applicant belongs to the village falling within the 10-km "border area" on either side. The proof of identity document is valid for one year.

 This new guidelines came into practical w.e.f. 1st Jan. 2025 at Zokhawthar and Hnahlan, Champhai District, Mizoram-Myanmar border.

1. **Surrendering of Myanmar Army**:

******The increase military operation conducted by the armed ethnic groups in different parts of Chin State and Rakhine State of Myanmar led to surrendering of Myanmar Army to Mizoram Police as well as Assam Rifles since the last part of 2023. In the month of November and December last year, as many as 255 personnel of Myanmar Army surrendered inside Champhai, Siaha and Lawngtlai District of Mizoram while in the month of January, 2024, 380 Myanmar Army personnel surrendered themselves inside Lawngtlai and Siaha District of Mizoram. These army personnel were at first airlifted back to Myanmar by Assam Rifles using helicopter but later were evacuated by military aircraft of Myanmar from Lengpui Airport. The Myanmar aircraft which is scheduled to evacuate the last 92 personnel crashed landed at Lengpui airport on 23.01.2024 injuring 6 crews on board but without any serious injuries or casualties. The last batch of the Myanmar Army personnel were finally evacuated by two Myanmar Airforce Special Flight on 24.01.2024. The total number of Myanmar Army personnel surrendered to Mizoram Police/Indian Security personnel in Mizoram is 635 as on 30.08.2024.**

**5.** **Biometric enrolment of refugees :**

The State Government under the leadership of the Hon’ble Chief minister decided to proceed with the biometric data collection of Myanmar and Bangladesh refugees in Mizoram provided that these refugees are not deported until and unless peace prevails in their respective countries. The State’s Home department has write a letter to the Union Ministry to examine the Foreigner’s Identification portal(FIP) which is meant for capturing the particulars of illegal immigrants and subsequent deportation requesting a change in the FIP to allow the refugees to remain in the State, and a reply on the matter is still awaited by the State. The centre has extended the time of Biometric enrolment till December, 2024 and Union Home Minister has reportedly assured the Hon’ble CM that the refugees will not be deported till peace is restored in the neighbouring countries.

1. **Issue related with Bangladesh:-**

1. **Influx of Refugee**

1. _Brief history -_

  A military operation against Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) by Bangladesh Army on 15.11.2022 at Chhaihkhiang Village, Bangladesh resulted in the mass exodus of civilians, mainly the Bawm community during which 272 civilians including women and children fled their villages to take shelter inside Mizoram.

Subsequent military operations led to 3 major influxes of Bawm civilians into Lawngtlai District of Mizoram which briefly halted during the Election process of Bangladesh in January 2024 and the peace talk between the KNA and Bangladesh Government. However, the looting of Banks and arms by KNA on 2nd and 3rd April 2024 resulted in an intensified operation against the KNA leading to more influxes of Bawm community into Mizoram.

The latest Bawm refugees numbering 93 persons who entered Damdep-II Village, Lawngtlai District, Mizoram on the night of 04.07.2024 were evacuated by BSF personnel to Crocodile Camp, Kamtuli in an attempt to deport the refugees. However, with the intervention of the State Government, the 93 Bawm refugees who were joined by another 33 Bawm refugeesat Chhippui BSF BOP were safely transported to Chamdur Village on the morning of 08.07.2024.

1. **Indo-Bangladesh Border Fencing** -

 The Indo-Bangladesh border, spanning approximately 4,096 kilometres, is one of the world’s longest international boundaries. This extensive border has seen significant efforts to bolster security and control migration through a comprehensive fencing project. The fencing along the Indo-Bangladesh border is largely completed, with over 90% installed. High-priority areas vulnerable to illegal crossings have been addressed, though some sections remain incomplete or need maintenance due to geographical challenges. The fencing primarily consists of barbed wire, supplemented by floodlights and surveillance systems.

**D. Arecanut Smuggling:-**

 Smuggling of illegal arecanut through Mizoram took place since the year 2016 mainly to evade the high tax imposed on the import of arecanut by GOI. Since then, as on 31stDecember 2024, Mizoram Police had seized 47,667 bags (3,367,830 kgs. approx) worth a total of Rs. 53,91,91,750/- which were further handed over to Custom Dept. and concerned DC’s for appropriate legal action or disposal.

 The Aizawl Bench of Hon’ble Gauhati High Court in its order dated 16th July 2024 has directed the CBI to probe the smuggling of arecanuts into Mizoram following a PIL filed by social activist Pi Vanramchhuangi (Ruatfela Nu) on 29th April 2024.

**G. Mizoram-Assam Boundary Dispute:**

1. **Brief history** :

 The Mizoram-Assam border, defined by the Constitution of India 1935, spans 164.6 km. Historically, Mizoram and Assam have contested the exact demarcation of this boundary. Mizoram claims a 1875 boundary marked by the British-era Inner Line Reserve Forest, while Assam adheres to a 1933 Survey of India map as its constitutional boundary.

1. **Bone of Contention**

 The crux of the dispute lies in differing interpretations of the border's demarcation. Mizoram asserts that the Inner Line Reserve Forest should be the boundary, while Assam upholds the 1933 map. This fundamental disagreement has led to a series of confrontations and skirmishes over the years.

**Recent Events**

The conflict has intensified with notable incidents:

- **27.02.2018**: The Mizoram Zirlai Pawl (MZP) constructed a rest house at Bairabi Zophai, which was demolished by Assam Police and Forest Officials, claiming it was within Assam’s territory.

- **30.06.2021**: Tensions peaked when approximately 60 youths from Vairengte, aiming to set up a camp at Aitlang, Vairengte for Mizoram Police, were stopped by Assam Police. This led to a standoff involving around 200 Assam Police personnel and 10 Mizoram Police. Assam Police, heavily outnumbering Mizoram forces, occupied the disputed area, prompting Mizoram's retreat to maintain status quo.

- **26.07.2021**: The situation escalated further when around 200 Assam Police, led by IGP Anurag Agarwal, attempted to forcefully remove Mizoram Police from their camp located at Vairengte Auto Stand. The confrontation turned violent with Assam Police using tear gas and smoke bombs. A series of exchanges of gunfire ensued, resulting in injuries on both sides. Properties, including vehicles, were damaged or set ablazed by unknown miscreants. 

**High-Level Meetings**

Efforts to resolve the dispute include several high-level meetings:

- **27.07.2021**:Chief Secretary level meeting alongwith DGP’s of both States chaired by Union Home Secretary at New Delhi.
- **05.08.2021**: A Ministerial level border talks meeting in Aijal Club, Mizoram.
- **09.08.2022**: Another Ministerial level meeting in Aijal Club.
- **17.11.2022**: Ministerial level Discussions in Guwahati, Assam.
- **09.08.2024**: Ministerial level latest talks in Mizoram’s State Guest House.

The Mizoram-Assam boundary dispute remains a complex issue, marked by historical grievances and sporadic violence. Continued dialogue and negotiation are crucial for achieving a lasting resolution.

**J**. **Insurgency in Mizoram:**

**Hmar Peoples Convention (Democratic) and its related issue:**

HPC(D), Hmar Peoples Convention (Democratic) was founded in 1996 with its President as Lalhmingthanga Sanate of Khawlian, Mizoram. However, after 15 years the President himself was impeached on September 2011 by HPC(D) council meeting for reportedly making an agreement with Kuki National Organisation (KNO) Manipur. H. Zosangbera was appointed as the Chairman of HPC(D). As a result of this impeachment, HPC(D) became divided into two factions – H. Zosangbera’s faction and Lalhmingthanga Sanate’s faction.

  After dialogue with Government of Mizoram, H. Zosangbera’s faction come overground at the Arms Carrying Ceremony held at CTI, Sesawng on 13.04.2018. However, Lalhmingthanga Sanate’s faction was dormant for a period of time but became active recently.

**HPC(D) Recent Activities:**

Lalhmingthanga Sanate of HPC(D) had started serving demand letters to most of the Village Councils located inside HPC(D) demand area (Aizawl, Kolasib and Saitual District) since end of 2022. They had also served another demand letter through Whatsapp during May/June 2023 and intimidating Village Council leaders to fulfill their demand or face consequences.

  Lalhmingthanga Sanate (53) s/o V.L.Ramliana, President, HPC (D) was apprehended by personnel of Assam Rifles and Assam police on 24.12.2022 with a .32 pistol and 48 live ammunitions in his possession in Cachar, Assam and was released on bail from judicial custody on 15.05.2023.

  As long as the armed group of Lalhmingthanga Sanate can move freely between the three sides of Mizoram, Manipur and Assam, they are sure to gain strength by absorbing more volunteers, even the possibilities of joining them by some of the surrendered cadres of H. Zosangbera’s faction cannot be ruled out.

 Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018.
