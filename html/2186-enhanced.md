****CHAKMA AUTONOMOUS DISTRICT COUNCIL (CADC)****

**Irregular Recruitment of Staff under CADC**

 Information has been received that Chakma Joint NGOs like Young Chakma Association (YCA), Chakma Mahila Samiti (CMS) and Mizoram Chakma Students Union (MCSU) in a joint meeting held at Kamalanagar on 10.7.2015 (Friday) accused Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC) of indulging in irregular recruitment of 101 (one hundred and one) staff under CADC. The Joint NGOs demanded the CADC to rectify such irregularity within 15 (fifteen) days.

 Chakma Joint NGO, a conglomeration of Central Young Chakma Association (CYCA), Chakma Mahila Samiti (CMS) and Mizoram Chakma Students Union (MCSU) organised a procession within Chawngte Town on 30.7.2015 in protest against inaction of the authority of Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC) towards their demands, i.e. cancellation of appointment order of 101 (one hundred and one) staff recruited without floating advertisement under CADC during 2015. About 250 (two hundred and fifty) volunteers took part in this procession.

 The authority of Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC) convened a meeting on 31.7.2015 @ 11:00 AM at CADC Office, Chawngte. The meeting was attended by Executive Members and Ruling Members of District Council (MDC). The Meeting refused to fulfill the demands of Chakma Joint NGO's for cancellation of the appointment order of 101 (one hundred and one) staff recruited by them reportedly without floating advertisement.

 As there was no positive response from the CADC authorities, the leaders of Joint Chakma NGOs decided to intensify their agitation by launching ‘Total Bandh’ today, i.e. 4.8.2015.

 On 4.8.2015 @ 6:30 AM, a mob of around 150-200 people attacked Chawngte/ Kamalanagar Police Station, Lawngtlai District after the following 9 (nine) leaders of Joint Chakma NGOs have been arrested in the morning of 4.8.2018 (4:30 AM to 5:30 AM) at Chawngte Police Station on the ground of preventive measures for the ‘Total Bandh’ called by Joint Chakma NGOs (Central Young Chakma Association, Mizoram Chakma Students Union &amp; Chakma Mahila Samiti) w.e.f. 6:00 AM on this day.

 The angry mob pelted stones and damaged some of the properties of Chawngte Police Station like window panes, Solar plates, etc and to disperse the irate mob, the Police resorted to lathi charge and eventually opened fire (around 8 rounds) as ordered by Executive Magistrate, Shri. Lallawmawma. Unfortunately, one Class-XI student identified as Agosh Chakma (16 yrs) S/o Nomuni Chakma, Kalamanagar Higher Secondary School (HSS) succumbed to injury suspected to have been caused by a deflected bullet. Three Policemen also sustained minor injuries.

 In the ensuing violence, the angry mob ransacked and damaged the following properties belonging to the CADC leaders, including residential buildings and vehicles within Chawngte town.__
