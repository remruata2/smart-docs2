Ref :  No MSB/CB/B-16/480 Dt. 4/9/2020

Sir,

 With reference to the letter no and subject mentioned above, discreet enquiry in regard to the opinion of Phuldungsei villagers following the inter-state boundary dispute between Mizoram and Tripura was conducted as for which the report is hereby disclosed below.

 Phuldungsei village, Zampui Hills, the center of dispute between the state of Mizoram and Tripura is the Southernmost village perched on the Zampui Hill range. The main road connecting Kanchanpur to Aizawl passes through the heart of the village dividing it with the eastern part belonging to the state of Mizoram.

 During the course of enquiry, leaders of Phuldungsei village (VC members), NGOs’ as well as relevant stake holders were contacted so as to ascertain their opinions and views in regard to their inclusion within the ambit of the Government of Mizoram.

 It is observed that the village leadership i.e Village Council, NGOs’ and prominent members of Phuldungsei village as a whole have had urged the successive Governments of Mizoram to set foot on its acclaimed area by setting up Government’s establishments and infrastructures.The Mizo families of Phuldungsei Mizoram are all inclined and choose to be permanently settled within Mizoram. Meanwhile the bulk of Bru families are in dilemma being unsure of its advantages and disadvantages it could bring about as a result of their inclusion inside Mizoram. However, these Bru families have not shown any objection nor any intent of resistance either toward the Mizoram Government’s efforts to include the village within its ambit.

 It is pertinent to mention that besides Phuldungsei village authority and NGOs’, Zampui Mizo Convention (MC) – the regional civil society organisation and the Tripura group YMA have had urged authority of successive Governments of Mizoram to set foot on its acclaimed land. This had been anticipated by all the Mizo community within Zampui Hills for their safety and security as well taking to account its strategic geographical location and sandwich between Chakma, Bru and Bengali community.

 Community based households data of Phuldungsei village is given below for convenience and easy reference:
