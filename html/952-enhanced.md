****Point No. 4 Smuggling of Arms Details****

****STRATEGY TO COMBAT ARMS SMUGGLING IN MIZORAM****

Due to the strategic location of Mizoram at the periphery of the Golden Triangle and sharing of long international boundaries with Myanmar and Bangladesh, Mizoram is vulnerable to arms smuggling. The State is often used as a conduit for arms smuggling by armed insurgent groups operating across the borders. The porous nature of the borders and topographic, communication and transportation challenges are factors that pose a huge challenge from the security point of view.

**Present Scenario & Challenges**:

As per record available, 314 numbers of cases have been registered by Mizoram Police in connection with Arms and Ammunition seizure during 2008 to 2019 (upto August) and 355 persons arrested. Arms and Ammunition are usually smuggled from Myanmar into Mizoram for onward movement to Bangladesh, Tripura and other states. The number of arms and ammunition seizures have drastically gone down in the last 3 (three) years or so, i.e., from 2017 – 2019 (up to August) the number of cases registered is 19. This can largely be attributed to the signing of Peace Agreement with the HPC (D) by the Govt. of Mizoram which resulted in Mizoram being an insurgent-free state.

The Challenges in evolving strategy to combat Arms smuggling lies in identification of source/origin of smuggled arms, routes, destinations, identification of prospective buyers and identification of those involved in the smuggling racket. Collection of good intelligence regarding arms smuggling also pose a big challenge. As with the case in drugs smuggling, majority of the accused in arms smuggling are of Myanmar nationals, working solo or hand in gloves with some Mizo locals. However, they are often a mere transporter or carrier of the consignments and hence their arrest is yet to achieve the desired result in cutting down the supply line.

**Strategies:**

1. **Identification of Source/Origin of Arms smuggling:**

Based on past seizures, the source of arms smuggling is usually Myanmar and entered into Mizoram at different crossing points**.**Accordingly, there is a need to pay due attention and vigil to all the crossing points along the border.

1. **Monitoring of known Routes of Arms smuggling**:

As per information and records available, all major arms smuggling have entered into Mizoram via Champhai district and thereafter transported to Aizawl. Major seizures took place in Aizawl and Champhai. Hence all crossing points in Champhai district and major roads from Champhai to Aizawl need to be constantly monitored. Tlabung, Chawngte, Marpara and Kanhmun are other important areas that require attention.

1. **Identification of transporters/carriers:**

Frequent transporters/carriers of arms or those persons who are considered to be vulnerable of being exploited or employed as transporters, should be identified and keep close watch. Economically backward persons residing in border areas will be more prone to become transporters.

1. **Identification of prospective buyers:**

Prospective buyers, such as, those having or suspected to have affinities or ties with underground groups or those with shady business dealings, etc. should be identified and monitored.

1. **Identification of king-pin of arms smuggling:**

This is the most important and yet the most challenging task. Inter-state coordination as well as Indo-Myanmar &amp; Indo-Bangladesh bilateral cooperation needs to be emphasized to identify the real player in arms smuggling. Technical surveillance should be well employed.

1. **Technical surveillance:**

Constant technical surveillance should be mounted on persons suspected to be involved in arms smuggling or those with past records.

1. **Setting up of dedicated squads:**

Dedicated and trained squads to be set up in all districts to tackle arms smuggling.

1. **Cultivation of sources/Special Police Officers**:

Sources should be cultivated in various crucial places. Special Police Officers may be engaged in various entry and exit points as well as even across the border.

**Effective guarding of the borders**:

The Assam Rifles and BSF entrusted with guarding of Mizoram-Myanmar and Mizoram-Bangladesh borders should be on high alert at all times to prevent any possible arms smuggling across the border.

At the same time, inter-state borders with Tripura, Manipur and Assam should be effectively guarded by Mizoram Police.

1. **Coordination with other stakeholders:**

Maintain better and meaningful co-ordination with other stakeholders and sister agencies.

1. **Strict Penal Actions:**

All persons involved in arms smuggling should be strictly prosecuted as per laws. There should not be any loopholes in investigation process. Stringent punishment should serve as deterrent factor.

1. **Awareness campaigns:**

Systematic and regular mass awareness campaigns to be undertaken by all stakeholders and at all levels.
