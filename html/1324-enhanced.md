****WRITE-UP OF AGENDA POINTS FOR NE DGsP/IGsP CONFERENCE- 2018****

****I. Overview of State Security****

The overall security of the State of Mizoram, by and large, remained relatively peaceful during 2017 (i.e. January 2017-29th December, 2017). Although peaceful, Mizoram is surrounded by countries and states which are having many disturbances with respect to insurgency and terrorism. The porous international border areas and peaceful atmosphere of Mizoram have unfortunately served as preferred routes for insurgent groups and other criminal elements to smuggle arms, ammunition and contraband drugs, etc.

Mizoram is having a stretch of approximately 510 Kms. and 318 Kms. porous International borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively. Further, the ‘Act East Policy’ actively pursued by the Central Government and the State Government is bound to bring our International/foreign neighbours closer to our Country in general and Mizoram in particular. Again, the construction of Kaladan Multi Modal Transit Transport Project and Highway project to connect Myanmar from southern part of Mizoram is in full progress. The aforesaid factors would definitely affect the commercial activities of stakeholder countries to a great extent and thereby creating opportunities for smuggling all kinds of contraband goods/items. This angle requires effective handling and control at all cost by strengthening intelligence network, constant vigil &amp; surveillance, frequent patrolling, manning regular check posts, etc.

**(i) Peace Talk between Government of Mizoram and HPC-D :**

5(five) rounds of Peace Dialogue between Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) were conducted within the year 2016 and 2017. During the talks, the arms and ammunitions which were snatched away by HPC(D) cadres from Mizoram Police during the ambushed laid by HPC(D) cadres on an entourage party of Committee on Government Assurance members at the outskirt of Zokhawthiang village, Aizawl District on 28.3.2015 were handed over to Govt. of Mizoram and the framework of agreement was worked out as well.

Finally, on 2.4.2018, Government of Mizoram and HPC-D signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) at the function held at the State Guest House, Aizawl. Shri. Arvind Ray, Chief Secretary of Mizoram and Pu H. Zosangbera, Chairman, HPC-D signed the MoS on behalf of the State Government and HPC(D) respectively. The signing of MoS brought an end to the over two-decades armed conflict of the HPC-D. The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC(D) was held at CTI, Sesawng on 12th April, 2018 where around 104 Cadres and 12 Council Members of HPC(D) come to over ground at this ceremony.

Due to the consequences of this agreement, the Governor of Mizoram constituted an Interim Council of the Sinlung Hills for a period of 6 (six) months and appointed 14 (fourteen) persons as members of this Interim Sinlung Hills Council on 9th July, 2018. The Oath Taking ceremony of members of the Interim Sinlung Hills Council was held in the office of Deputy Commissioner, Aizawl District on 13.7.2018 @ 10:00 a.m. Dr. A. Muthamma, DC, Aizawl District administered the oath of affirmation to the appointed 14 (fourteen) members of the Interim Sinlung Hills Council.

****II. Overview of Law and order situation in the State of Mizoram****

Law and order situation in the State of Mizoram, by and large remained relatively peaceful during 2017 (i.e January 2017-29th December, 2017). However, some activities of Political parties, NGOs, Student organisations, etc. affecting law and order situation in Mizoram during 2017 were highlighted as under:

**(i) Political Parties Activity:**

During the period between January, 2017- August, 2018, all political parties like MPCC, BJP, MNF, ZNP, MPC, etc. remained busy in organizing workers’ conferences, public meetings and awareness programmes to garner public support in their favour for the upcoming Mizoram MLA election, 2018. Besides, the opposition political parties like MNF, ZNP, MPC and their frontal organizations raised several allegations against the incumbent government on various issues like protest against dilapidated/bad condition of roads in different parts of Mizoram, Protest against selling of liquor, etc. However, all these political parties’ activities did not escalate into any serious law and order problem.

1. _ILP Checking Drive_ :

Central Young Mizo Association (CYMA) which is the most influential NGO of Mizoram conducted Inner Line Permit (ILP) checking against non-tribal traders/workers illegally staying in Mizoram without valid ILP.

 Recently, organisation such as Mizo Zirlai Pawl and Central Young Mizo Association claimed that there are over 40 lakhs in Assam who are not included in the NRC and are taking necessary initiatives to counter the migration of these foreigners. Apart from urging Mizoram Government to conduct checking of illegal foreigners in Mizoram, the MZP had conducted these checking themselves since 17.8.2018 at 3(three) locations, viz. Vairengte, Bairabi,Saiphai which are located at Mizoram-Assam border. No untoward incident has been reported during this activity.

1. _District Demand Protest_ :

Several committee like Saitual District Implementing Demand Committee (SDIDC), Khawzawl District Implementation Demand Committee (KDIDC), Hnahthial District Demand Committee (HDDC), Darlawn District Demand Committee (DDDC) launched agitation like total band, etc during 2017 in demand of establishment of District Headquarters in their respective areas. (In a Notification issued by GAD on 12th September, 2008, Government of Mizoram had announced****Saitual, Hnahthial and Khawzawl as District Headquarters).

**(iii) Labour & Service organizations activity :**

1. Mizoram CSS Hindi Teachers Association (MCHTA) organized Hunger strike during 22nd – 28th March, 2017 in demand of regularisation of their services. The agitating members breached the security of the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Mizoram on 28.3.2017. However, the police managed to disperse the agitators peacefully and all the leaders of MCHTA were arrested and released them on bail after they promised to call off their agitation.

1. Members of Federation of Mizoram Government Employees &amp; Workers (FMGE&amp;W) launched a series of agitation like attending office with wearing black badges, Pen-down strike and Mass Casual leave during November-December, 2017 in demand of implementation of Recommendation of 7th Pay Commission for Government employees of Mizoram. However, they called off their agitation on 7.12.2017 after they received verbal assurances from the Hon’ble Chief Minister and Hon’ble Home Minister to look into their demand. The agitation did not escalate into any major law and order situation.

(c) On 26.7.2018, Joint Students' Union, Managing Boards and Joint Action Committee of the 9 (nine) Mizoram Government Lumpsum Grant-in-Aid Higher Secondary School Association (MIGLAHSSA), viz.

**(iv) Activity of Students Organisations :**

****(a)** During the month of July, 2017, Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) launched a strong protest against the selection of students from Chakma Community for MBBS seat against Mizoram state quota. The activists of MZP assembled in front of the office of the Joint Director, Higher &amp; Technical Education (Technical Wing), Government of Mizoram at Chaltlang, Aizawl on 20th July, 2017 trying to prevent all the Chakma students from attending the counselling session for allotment of Medical(MBBS) seat. However, these activists of MZP started attacking the police personnel after they learnt that all the Chakma students had attended the counselling session under the escort of Police. As preventive measures, the police also resorted to lathi charge with tear gas and the irate mobs finally dispersed from the premises of the office of the Joint Director, Higher &amp; Technical Education (Technical Wing), Government of Mizoram at Chaltlang, Aizawl. The situation was handled by the local administration and police tactfully.**

**(b)** On 8.3.2018 members of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) left Aizawl for Zophai near Bairabi, Kolasib District with an intention to reconstruct Zofate Chawlhbuk (Shed) at the disputed site along Mizoram-Assam border.

  At around 11:45 am, a minor scuffle broke out between the Student union and Assam Police when some members of the student union tried to unload their building materials from the vehicle. The Assam Police had even resorted to Lathi-charge as a result of which around 15 (fifteen) MZP members reportedly sustained minor injuries.

  On****10.3.2018,a scuffle broke out again between Assam Police and members of Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) when around 100 (hundred) strong MZP members proceeded to the disputed site at Zophai with their building materials to reconstruct ‘Zofate Chawlhbuk’ . The students were intercepted by Assam Police before they reached the disputed site and they subsequently used force to disperse them. It has been reported that the Assam Police initially used Lathi but later on resorted to firing and around 8 (eight) shots were reportedly fired as a result of which one MZP member reportedly sustained gunshot injury on his right ankle and around 49 (forty nine) others sustained injuries on their persons. It was also reported that 8 (eight) media persons also sustained injuries. The Assam Police burnt down the temporary shed constructed by the MZP near the disputed site and the following vehicles belonging to MZP members were also ransacked by Assam Police :-****(1) Sumo - 1 no. (2) Taxi -1 no. (3) Car (Nano) - 1 no. (4) M/Cycles -3 nos.****

******The scuffle which arose between MZP and Assam Police due to border issue at Zophai resulted in the announcement of Non-Mizo curfew by the students’ organization under the aegis of Mizo Students’ Union (MSU) on 10.3.2018. The curfew was soon called off and there was no report of untoward incident.**

  Many non-Mizos left Mizoram out of fear for their own safety; there were rumours among themselves about possible consequences due to the border issue. However, life became peaceful and normal again soon after. Most of the Non-Mizos who had left Mizoram have also come back to Mizoram and resumed their normal routine life.

  The matter remains dormant and could erupt again any moment depending on the time when MZP resurface the issue.

**(v) Setting up of more security check posts along the border of Mizoram(India) with Bangladesh and Myanmar.**

 Mizoram is having approximately 404 kms and 318 kms porous international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh respectively. The porous international borders served as an important route for IIGs to procure arms and ammunitions and also to smuggle durgs, etc across the borders of Mizoram. In addition, two big infrastructure project viz. Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP), Bairabi-Sairang railway line being implemented in Mizoram under Act East Policy will automatically increase chances of infiltration of foreigners across Mizoram from Myanmar and Bangladesh and would also encourage illegal criminal activities across the border.

****(vi) Discretionary component be introduced under Security Related Expenditure (SRE) by Central Government for the State of Mizoram.****

 Three Armed Battalions and five Indian Reserve Battalions of Mizoram Police are spending a lot of fund in resisting insurgency and terrorist related activities like kidnappings, extortions, bomb blast for the purpose of terrorizing, drugs and gun running in North East and North West corners of Mizoram by maintaining close vigil on border outposts along its borders with insurgency affected neighbouring states/countries. Additional costs with respect to TA/DA and Honorarium to staff is also not being reimbursed in any form from Central Government.

  The Scheme of Security Related Expenditure (SRE) be extended to Mizoram to wean away misguided youth and militants that have strayed into the folds of militancy and in order to maintain peace and normalcy.
