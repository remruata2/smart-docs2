**Note:** The inception of Tablighi Jamaat movement could be traced way back to the year 1985 under the initiative of Shri LR. Laskar IAS and Shri Hajmudul Lakhan, Pushpak official during their tenure in Mizoram. Since its inception, Tablighi Jamaat devotees and enthusiasts/Tablighis in Mizoram does not dissociate themselves from the local Mosque organization nor do they refrain from participating in Muslim activities. Tablighi Jamaat in Mizoram does not have any organizational structure or any permanent members.

 Chanmari Markaz, Aizawl is the only official permanent Markaz run by Tablighis in Mizoram. Shabgujary(spending the night) conducted on every Saturday evening is the main programme held at the Markaz. In this congregation, teachings of prophet Muhammed and Quran are imparted besides Namaz(prayer) are used to be taught in such a way that layman could comprehend it. Jamaat(outreach mission) is another prominent activity of Tablighi Jamaat wherein any Tablighis who could volunteer himself for either 3 days, 40 days, 4 months, 5 months etc. would set out for outreach mission. However, Tablighi Jamaat movement in Mizoram is getting less relevant as the bulk of devotees and enthusiasts in Mizoram are mostly migrant labourers having no time to have vibrant activities. It is learnt that Tablighis in Mizoram have been unable to observe Jamaat for quite a while.

 Dr. Jamal Hussain have visited Nizamuddin Markaz, Delhi on March, 2019 and Joynal Uddin of Saiphai have visited Nizamuddin Markaz during November - December, 2019. These are the two Tablighi Jamat member from Mizoram who have visited Nizamuddin Markaz so far.
