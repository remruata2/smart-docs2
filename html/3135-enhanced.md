Vairengte youth dispersed last night i.e., 30.6.2021 @ 1:30 a.m. without any untoward incident. At the same time, there was a stand-off between around 200 (two hundred) Assam Police Personnel, which was later reinforced by 2(two) Companies of CRPF from Bilaipur, Assam and 10 (ten) Mizoram Armed Police personnel and 3 (three) MRP personnel led by Pu David J.

Pu Rohan Kumar Jha, DC Hailakandi and Pi Ramandeep Kaur, SP Hailakandi were also present at the area at that time and they remained there till today, i.e., 30.6.2021 @ 10:30 a.m.

The stand-off lasted for several hours and later, as per the order of DC, Hailakandi and SP, Hailakandi, Assam Police, who heavily outnumbered Mizoram Police at the area, forcefully cleared their path and in the meantime, a good number of Assam Police personnel bypassed the area through Jungle route and stationed themselves at Pu Chhandama's areca nut plantation. Such a situation compelled Mizoram Police to retreat back to Pu Chhandama's areca nut plantation and joined SP, Kolasib, who was already stationed along with 7 (seven) IR personnel to counter further inward progress of Assam Police.

Dr. H. Lalthlangliana, DC, Kolasib arrived at Pu Chhandama's areca nut plantation this morning @ 9:00 a.m. and held a brief meeting with DC, Hailakandi, who was already stationed at the area.

178 (one hundred seventy eight) Mizoram Armed Police personnel (39 from 1st IR Battalion, 37 from 5th IR, 51 from 1st MAP and 51 from 3rd MAP ) were deployed at Vairengte to promptly respond to any emerging situation and to perform necessary duty at Aitlang area today i.e., 30.6.2021 @ 2:00 p.m.

DC, Kolasib gave situation report in the meeting and stated that a camp is intended to be set up for Mizoram Police at Pu Darthantluanga’s farm land as the area is favorable due to its strategic location and road connecting the farm land will be constructed.
