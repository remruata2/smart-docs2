**CYMA rechecked Rangvamual & Phunchawng**: Around 300 members of Branch YMA OB's and CYMA Kumpuan Sub-Committee members went to Phunchawng and Rangvamual on Saturday and made a survey of number of foreigners and illicit liquor sellers living there.

 Questionaire asking the name of the head of the family, occupation, Epic no., ration card no., where they came from, name of the owner of the house and contact no. was distributed to each house by members of CYMA.

 CYMA will decide its next step depending on the survey report.
