 Ramdinliani said, "Mizoram's main source of petrol is Silchar depot, Assam where sufficient amount could not be stored as train loads could not reach it due to the floods of Silchar. Diesel, however, is not affected by the situation in Silchar."

 "Despite various difficulties, petrol is being transported to meet the daily needs of the people, however, controlling its sales is necessary to avert hoarding by some people" FCS&amp;CA Secretary further said.
