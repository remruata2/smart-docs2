_THREAT PERCEPTION ASSESSMENT REPORT_

Through detailed interaction with Pu Liansangzuala, Presiding Officer, MACT , it was found out that he does not have direct or indirect threat or intimidation of any kind from anyone at present and in the past as well. However, he, being a Grade - I officer of Mizoram Judicial Service, in his previous posting, many a times, he had dealt with various heinous crimes/offences in which he had convicted many hardened and hardcore criminals whom he even gave life sentences to many. Even though the present posting he hold may not seem precarious, it has to be noted that the aforementioned criminals and their accomplices could seek vengeances against him.

Similarly, any other officers who will be holding the Presiding Officer's post in the future will also probably have been involved in the aforesaid serious crimes’ cases in their previous postings just as Pu Liansangzula and the possibilities of having serious personal threats will be same. It is therefore viewed that provision of Security for Presiding Officer of MACT was obviously necessary for the security of the officer whoever hold the said post.
