****Case Discharged****:** KL Liana, Special Judge discharged the case of former Director of AH&amp;Vety. as ACB produced prosecution sanction issued by Commissioner/Secretary DP&amp;AR and not the Governor as the law dictates. According to reports ACB is supposed to take prosecution sanction from Governor but it took it from Commissioner/Secretary DP&amp;AR. The court could not accept the prosecution sanction as it was not taken from where the law demands; as such is the situation Dr. C. Sangnghina’s case regarding corruption was discharged by Special Court.**

 Mizoram does not have Directorate of Prosecution but has General Registration Branch led by Inspector of Police.
