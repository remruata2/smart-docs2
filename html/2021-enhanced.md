****INTERROGATION STATEMENT OF PAULALLIAN SINGSON****

**In the year 2007, the leaders of Kuki National Front (Military Council) by force recruited the Thado tribe youths, one from each family having more than three male members. As such I had also joined the outfit on 7.4.2007. The President of the outfit was Germana alias Hemlal of Tuiveizang, Manipur and there were a little over hundred Cadres under him. I had resigned from the outfit in September 2009 I was called by James Seilienthuom(L) former SS Army Chief of UTLA to explain the reasons of my resignation to him. On 15th December, I met James who told me to be with him during the Media Conference to be held the week after. Media Conference was held at Sirongphu village in Manipur which was attended by one and three pressmen respectively from Manipur and Assam. The reason for holding the Press Conference was to declare the formation of the United Tribal Liberation Army (UTLA). During my stay with them I was detailed for duty in and around Tomenglong and Churachanpur district, I went home on my own accord in February 2010. Not long after that James was called by NSCN(K) for talks at Lungkaiphun village in Manipur and James went there with eight of his comrades. The talks might have gone wrong that James and three of his boys were shot dead by the NSCN(K) while five of them managed to escape. After the death of James, the post of Army Chief was entrusted to Kai Robert of Saikulhphai village, Manipur.**
