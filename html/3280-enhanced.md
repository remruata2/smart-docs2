**NIA to probe on arms smuggling in Mizoram:** The Union Home Ministry has issued a notification to the National Investigation Agency to conduct a detailed investigation inside Mizoram after the arrest of 3 Bangladeshi nationals with 33 AK-47 rifles, one LMG and US made BAR on 8th March this year by Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles. One of the main reason for this investigation is the fact that Mizoram, which is regarded as "an island of peace" has become a transit point for several arms smugglers and underground groups as the neighbouring States have tightened their securities.

 The Chief Minister of Mizoram, Pu Lal Thanhawla had given assurance in his speech on 19.2.2011 that the State has become free of arms smuggling. The NIA, nevertheless, registered a case in its Guwahati branch on friday to conduct its investigation.
