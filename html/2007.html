In the month of June/July 2006 I had approach DHD (Nunisia Faction) at their camp in Haflong, NC Hills and stayed there for about a month and returned home as they were reluctant to accept/enroll me. But when I went there again after a month, I was accepted.</span></strong></span></span></p>

After the training we sent those youths back home. We had given Rs.30,000/- to the DHD as training fee/costs.</span></strong></span></span></p>

But Donoram was killed soon after the merger by someone amongst the group itself. After that incident the group were operating for a while calling themselves &#39;The United Liberation Front of Barak Valley (ULFB). The outfit had surrendered to the Assam Govt. in 2008. However, the Assam Govt. they felt, was not keeping its promises and, therefore, regrouped in which majority of them Brus. When I had learnt that Raj Muni was among them, I too had joined the group.</span></strong></span></span></p>

We have no permanent camp of our own.</span></strong></span></span></p>

I had also joined them at Kalapahar, Tripura in November 2009. We entered Kaiskau and Khallchangpara (both refugee camps) area in January 2010. I handed over charge of the group to Thomas on 10.1.2010 who was sent by Raj. I took rest till last part of February 2010 at Dosda where my parents were staying.</span></strong></span></span></p>

We had procured arms mostly from ZRA but I do not know how the deal was made as the same was done solely by Raj himself. Our arms holding at present is - 1) AK- 47 Rifle&nbsp;&nbsp; -2 nos. with 150-200 ammns. 2) SLR&nbsp;&nbsp; -1no. 3) Stangun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -1no. 4) M-16 Rifle&nbsp;&nbsp; -1no. 5) G-4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -1no. 6) G-2&nbsp;&nbsp; -1no. 7) .22 Miniature Rifle&nbsp;&nbsp; -1no. 8) Lethod&nbsp;&nbsp; -1no.</span></strong></span></span></p>
