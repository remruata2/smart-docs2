**Border issues with Assam:**

The Assam-Mizoram border has remained relatively calm despite the disputed nature of the border. However, tension along this border flared up in the month of April, 2014 at the inter-state border between Assam’s Hailakandi district and Mizoram’s Kolasib district after Assam Police and Forest Department personnel allegedly dismantled the farmhouse of Mizo farmers near Buhchangphai village in Mizoram. A meeting has been held in Shillong on 24th September 2014 between Mizoram and Assam Officials to resolve this burning issue. On June,2014 Pu. Lal Thanhawala, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Mizoram met Pu. Rajnath Singh, Hon’ble Union Home minister and requested him to ensure settlement of the Mizoram-Assam boundary dispute.
