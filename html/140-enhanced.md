**Action Plans on North East Indian Insurgents Groups**

(v) Action Plan on Choking ration supply from Indian side:

1. All possible supply routes to be identified including footpaths. All district SsP bordering Myanmar to strictly man all such entry and exit point along the Mizoram-Myanmar to prevent movement of unwanted elements and supply of illegal goods. Surprised checking to be regularly conducted along the border especially during night time.

2. Intensified and thorough checking of all vehicles, especially at Zokhawthar, along the Mizoram-Myanmar border to prevent movement of illegal goods.

3. Review the existing trade agreements regarding goods permitted to cross the Mizoram-Myanmar border and restrict such goods that are found to be utilized by IIGs in Myanmar. The option on fixing the amount of goods that can be carried/transported will help in leaving the insurgents short of supplies.

4. Assam Rifles manning the Mizoram-Myanmar border to be on high alert and to maintain strict vigil along the border to prevent movement of any unauthorised articles.

5. Custom department to reinforce checking of goods at check gates.

6. Holding regular coordination meeting with concern authorities on Myanmar side so that concerted efforts be given to prevent entry of illegal goods into Myanmar.

7. Maintain high vigil regarding smuggling of FICN or other contraband items into Mizoram which can be used for procuring goods for/by the IIGs in Myanmar.

(vii) Authentic border pass system need to be in place. All residents residing within 16 kms from the border to be given border pass. State Government should keep proper record of all the border passes issued and ensure that only eligible residents are given border pass. The entry and exit of such persons should be properly maintained. Any persons overstaying the permit should be immediately pushed back.

The border guarding force should keep constant vigil along the border and prevent trans- border movement of unauthorised persons. Checking of border pass for movement across the border should be done in collaboration with state police force.
