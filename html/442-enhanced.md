To,

   The Asst. Inspector General of Police-I

   Mizoram, Aizawl

Subject:  Provision of threat perception/intelligence inputs to the PPs visiting/staying at Delhi from Mizoram.

Ref:  No.CB/PHQ/C/204/07/310 dt. 8.11.2013.

Sir,

  With reference to the above, I am sending herewith assessment of threat perception of the PPs of Mizoram and the possible degree of threat during their visit/stay at Mizoram House, New Delhi or elsewhere as under for your information and necessary action:-

 Mizoram State, though, has never been afflicted by subversive activities of militant outfits from within, it occasionally faced certain felonious activities from some insurgent outfits namely - National Liberation Front of Tripura(NLFT), Hmar People Convention(Democratic) (HPC-D) and Bru National Army(BNA) who are operating from neighbouring states and Bangladesh as well. Peace talks between Govt. of Mizoram and HPC(D) had failed and the agreement of Suspension of Operation(SoO) became null and void. The HPC(D) at present is reportedly intensifying its anti-Government activities in Mizoram. Further, the HPC(D) had also propagated their disappointment regarding the deadlock in the said peace talks and strongly blamed the Govt. of Mizoram for its failure.

 In view of the above mentioned points and the present activities of the HPC(D), security of all the PPs of Mizoram Government may be taken into account during their tours within or outside Mizoram.

Yours faithfully,

**(H.RAMTHLENGLIANA)**
