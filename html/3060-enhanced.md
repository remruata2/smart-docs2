****1.** MSU General Headquarters convened its Executive Meeting today, i.e., 1.11.2020 @ 10:00 a.m. at Zirlaite Run, MSU Pisa Pui, Aizawl under the chairmanship of J. Lalmuanzuala, Vice-President, MSU General Headquarters and around 25 (twenty five) members were present. The meeting discussed about holding of meeting between officials of Karimganj District, Assam and the officials of Mamit District, Mizoram in connection with inter-state boundary affairs at Isabeel Tea Estate, Karimganj District, Assam yesterday, i.e., 31.10.2020, which was attended by DC Mamit and SP Mamit amidst opposition to holding of any inter-state meeting with Assam by the people of Mizoram as well as burning of the said meeting minute.**

 The meeting condemned holding of the above meeting and considered both DC Mamit and SP Mamit as not fit enough to look after border district like Mamit and demanded their transfer from Mamit. Thereafter, the members present at the meeting proceeded to Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) and burnt a copy of the said meeting minute in front of CMO main gate. A Press Release in this regard was issued by MSU General Headquarters wherein it highlighted the speech made by J. Lalmuanzuala, Vice-President in which he requested the Government to transfer DC Mamit and SP Mamit within the next 24 (twenty four) hours. MSU General Headquarters also submitted a written petition to the Hon'ble Chief Minister requesting for immediate transfer of the 2 (two) officials.

 Similarly, MZP General Headquarters also burnt a copy of the stated meeting minute in front of Vanapa Hall, Aizawl today, i.e., 1.11.2020 @ 11:30 a.m. as it considered the meeting minute to be unacceptable and unsafe for Mizoram future. Around 60 (sixty) persons which included representatives of other ethnic based students’ union and college students’ union were present.

 Both MZP General Headquarters and MSU General Headquarters vehemently opposed holding of meeting with Assam amidst the prevailing border tensions as well as the minute of the above referred meeting which includes withdrawal of Police Forces of Mizoram from Choto-Bubirbond and Medlicherra Area of Karimganj district of Assam and absence of any claim on the said area or articulation of opposition to it from the Mizoram Officials’ side.

200 mtrs from Phainuam village and approximately 1.5 km towards Mizoram from Mizo IR Bn. COVID-19 Duty Post set up at Phainuam Buarchep Veng junction inside Mizoram. The estimated value of properties damaged due to the fire was Rs.4,21,000/- (approx.) which included a Power Tiller. The Hut was occupied by Samir Uddin Barbhuya (25), s/o Hasson Ali, Govindapur, Bagha, Assam who was employed as caretaker/worker in the paddy field since last year, i.e., 2019, and he was the lone occupant at the time of the incident as his wife and their 2 (two) children reported went to Bagha the day before for medical treatment.


 In this connection, 6 MZP members led by Lalnunmawia Pautu, General Secretary, MZP General Headquarters and Andrew Lalropuia, President, MZP Sub-Headquarters Vairengte arrived at the site of incident at 9:10 p.m. last evening. The occupant of the Hut Samir Uddin Barbhuya was examined and he was reported to have said that he saw 2 (two) persons speaking Bangla language running away from the place of occurrence towards Saihapui stream.

 Due the above incident, Pu R. Lalhmingliana (owner of the said paddy field/Hut); John Laldinmawia, Secretary, Vairengte Thailai Pawl and Alex Lalramnghaka, Secretary, MZP Sub-Headquarters, Vairengte submitted 3 (three) separate FIR at Vairengte Police Station. Accordingly Vrte PS C/No.33/20 dt.1.10.2020 u/s 436 has been registered and investigation is underway.

 In view of the prevailing border tensions between Mizoram and Assam, re-occurrence of such unwanted incident perpetrated by extremist elements of either side of the border cannot be ruled out and all concern Police force needs to beef up necessary precautionary measures including foot patrolling, area domination, intelligence collection, etc.
 Situation is under close watch.
