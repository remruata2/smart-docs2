This resulted in a minor scuffle between the Student Organization and Assam Police when some members of the student Organization tried to unload their building materials from the vehicle. The Assam Police resorted to Lathi-charge as a result of which around 15 (fifteen) MZP members reportedly sustained minor injuries.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Several students leaders and even 8 (eight) Media persons sustained injuries as a result of this scuffle.

They also collected donation for recurring damages caused to the properties of MZP by Assam Police as the Government was unable to pay compensation for them. As of now, they have strongly urged the state Government to construct &lsquo;Zofate Chawlhbuk&rsquo; at Zophai failing which they would take every possible step for the reconstruction.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
