**Notes for LIA meeting on 28.03.2024 @ 1600 hrs**

_2. Agenda points proposed to be discussed during the meeting :-_

i) Security scenario in Mizoram with special reference to insurgency and smuggling :

 Mizoram itself experiences low level insurgencies in the North Eastern and the North Western regions. However, Government of Mizoram and HPC(D) (the insurgent group from the northern parts) had signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) on 2nd April 2018. The signing of MoS brought about an end to over two-decade armed insurgency of the HPC(D). The Arms Laying Ceremony of HPC-D was held on 12th April, 2018 where around 102 (one hundred two) Cadres and 12 (twelve) Council Members of HPC(D) came to over ground at the ceremony. However, the other faction of HPC(D) led by Lalhmingthanga Sanate have started resurfacing and reorganise themselves. They have been indulging in collection of donation and extortion during the closing months of 2022 and the opening months of 2023.

 On the night of 23.03.2024 the special operation team of CID(SB) apprehended three HPC (D) cadres who are recently involved in extortions of money from non-local traders travelling between Mauchar Village and NEEPCO establishments from the residence of Lalsiamthanga Buhril (49) s/o B.

ii) Trans-border crimes and illegal movement through border (BD side activities) :

 The joint military operation against Kuki Chin National Army (KNA) by Bangladesh Army and Arakan Army (AA) which commenced on 15.11.2022 at Chhaihkhiang Village, Bangladesh had resulted in the mass exodus of civilians, mainly the Bawm community within Chhaihkhiang and its adjoining villages into Mizoram. Influx of refugees from Bangladesh into southern part of Mizoram can occur anytime depending on the incident of clash between KNA and Bangladesh Army backed AA. Though there is no threat perceived from these refugees, but it appears that some active cadres of KNA also used Mizoram to seek refuge.

 Village-wise report of Bangladesh Nationals seeking refuge in Lawngtlai District, Mizoram is as under:

(As on 27.03.2024)

|  | **TOTAL** | **1197** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sl. No | Name of village | Number of refugees |
| 1. | Mautlang | 66 |
| 2. | Chamdur P1 | 120 |
| 3. | Vathuampui | 296 |
| 4. | Parva-III | 233 |
| 5. | Hruitezawl | 105 |
| 6. | Hmawngbu | 140 |
| 7. | Hmunnuam | 30 |
| 8. | Tuithumhnar | 109 |
| 9. | Bungtlang South | 98 |


(iii) Indo Myanmar Border update and influx of Myanmarese nationals :

 Mizoram shares 496.531 kms of international border with Myanmar as per the record of Directorate of Land Revenue &amp; Settlement, Government of Mizoram which is unfenced. Moreover, the Free Movement Regime allows people of the adjoining countries to enter 16 kms. into the neighbouring state. The Indo-Myanmar border security is currently handled by Assam Rifles who are thinly stretched along the whole length of the border.

 Military rule which took place in Myanmar on 1st February 2021 deposed thedemocratically electedNational League for Democracy and the escalating resistance put up against the military regime by Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) resulted in the influxes of considerable number of refugees from Myanmar in general and Chin community in particular seeking asylum and taking shelter in Mizoram. These refugees presently took shelter in various districts of Mizoram and are accommodated in their relative’s houses and makeshift camps set up by NGOs. According to the latest information received, makeshift camps for Myanmar refugees are constructed at Zawlsei, Vaphai, Farkawn and Chawngtui Villages in Champhai District and at Thingsai, Bualpui 'H', New Ngharchhip and Cherhlun Villages by in Hnahthial District by their respective local NGOs.

 The district wise details of Myanmar refugees, as per this office records, are highlighted in the following table (as on 27.03.2024):

| **Sl.No** | **District** | **Total numbers of Refugees** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Aizawl | 3306 |
| 2. | Champhai | 12484 |
| 3. | Hnahthial | 1101 |
| 4. | Khawzawl | 125 |
| 5. | Kolasib | 138 |
| 6. | Lawngtlai | 5954 |
| 7. | Lunglei | 2009 |
| 8. | Mamit | 356 |
| 9. | Saitual | 195 |
| 10. | Serchhip | 509 |
| 11. | Siaha | 5916 |
| **TOTAL -** |  | **32,093** |


 It may be mentioned that the above figures are prone to fluctuations as the refugees themselves did not settled down permanently and often moved across the border due to certain reasons such as financial reasons, family affairs etc.

 Influx of Myanmar refugees in large numbers can have an adverse impact socio-economically not only to their relatives who shelter them but also the state government in general. The increase in the number of thefts and robberies may also be attributed to the large number of unemployed refugees. The possibility of Law and Order due to internal feuds between the permanent resident of Mizoram and the refugees could not be ruled out on issues like issuance of birth certificate or other documents to these refugees.
