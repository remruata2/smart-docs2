****INTERROGATION STATEMENT OF AUAWANG KONYAK****

**After completing five months training (with replicated arms) in a jungle near Dimapur, I, alongwith my colleagues viz:- 1) SS Pvt. Cipu 2) SS Pvt. Aungu 3) SS Pvt. Wangcho 4) SS Pvt. Tiso 5) SS Pvt. Mokado Sewa 6) SS Pvt. Chupi 7) SS Sgt. Major Mala had set out for Bangladesh under the command of SS Sgt. Major Mala in February 2004.**

**We reached Aizawl by private sumo and from Aizawl we reached Bangladesh border by PWD vehicle. I was not familiar with which route we had taken and was also not aware of how we used PWD vehicle. We crossed the Indo-Bangla border at a village called Bokching and BSF Camp was also there nearby. We were received by Mr. David (didn't know his real identity) and SS L/Cpl. Aketo (NSCN-IM).**

**After entering Bangladesh we reached a place called Rolui where the NSCN(IM) had a camp with about 20 NSCN cadres, from there we were taken to Bethel Camp where around 30-36 cadres were staying and SS Capt. Asing (maybe a Manipuri) was the commander. Arms holding at Bethel Camp were:**

**1) Sniper Rifle - 2**

**2) AK-56 - 2**

**3) Semi Auto Rifle - 3**

**There was also NSCN(IM) camp called Zion Campt in Bandarban District where 31 cadres were staying. The commander of the camp was SS Lt. Hongmi Tangkhul, other leaders were SS 2nd Lt. Joshua, Adjutant; SS 2nd Lt. Thongam Tangkhul, Medical Officer; SS 2nd Lt. Aghast, Quarter Master. Arms holding at Jaiun Camp were:-**

**1) AK-66 - 2**

**2) AK-56 - 1**

**and about 300 ammns.**

**During our stay in the Zion Camp we had often requested our leaders for going to Nagaland and visit our families but rejected every time and that made some of us very disappointed. Then we secretly intended to desert from the camp and surrender.**

**Then on 29.1.2010 evening, I, with six of my colleagues had created commotion in the Jaium Camp and exchanged firing with the opposite party and I thought we had killed four of them. We then fled with whatever weapons we were holding plus some amount of Indian and Bangladesh currencies to the jungle. Our main intention at that time was to enter into India and surrender before AR, BSF or Police.**

**Our activities after leaving the Jaiun Camp might be summarized as:-**

| **Dt. 29.1.2010** | **-** | **Slept in the jungle.**  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dt. 30.1.2010** | **-** | **Entered into one village of Bawm community.**  |
| **Dt. 31.1.2010 - 6.2.2010** | **-** | **Hiding in the jungle and the Bawm people gave us food secretly.**  |
| **Dt. 7.2.2010** | **-** | **Splited into two groups thinking it would be easier for maintaining ourselves.** |


**Group-I 1) SS Cpl. Akim**

**2) SS Cpl. Zutovi**

**3) SS L/Cpl. Maya**

**4) SS L/Cpl. Mokado**

**The group was having 2 AK-66 with 60 ammns.**

**Group-II 1) SS Cpl. Auaway (self)**

**2) SS Cpl. Wangcho**

**3) SS L/Cpl. Aio**

**The group was having 1 AK-56 with 70 ammns.**

**On 7.2.2010 while our group was in a jungle near a village named Chekhiang in Bangladesh, we were ambushed by those we left at the camp and my two colleagues Wangcho and Aio were killed. I somehow managed to escape but left my weapon at the ambush site.**

**After the ambush, I reached a Bawm village called Salupi in Bangladesh. As requested, two Bawm had taken me to another Bawm village called Muru and gave them Rs. 4000/-(Indian currency). From Muru I was taken to Vaseitlang by two local men on 11.2.2010 and surrendered to 96th Bn. A-Coy BSF without arms.**

**On 14.2.2010 I was taken to Lawngtlai Police Station where a case was registered against me u/s 121A IPC(vide LTI P.S C/No. 13/10 dt. 15.2.2010 u/s 121A IPC).**

**Known NSCN(IM) leaders:-**

**1. President - Isaac Muivah.**

**2. Chief of Army - SS Gen. Markson Tangkhul.**

**Our normal duty at the camp was collecting firewoods. I believed the financial position of NSCN(IM) was sound. Main source of income was from Nagaland itself. I do not know the present strength of the NSCN(IM) outfit.**
