Subj: Assessment of threat perception.

Sir,

 With reference to your Order no.No.MSB/CB/B-19(A)/07 dt.13/5/2015, I had conducted assessment of threat perceived with regard to Pu Andrew Lalherliana, Chairman, Mizoram Public Service Commission which I disclosed as under.

 Pu Andrew Lalherliana had served as a General Secretary of Mizoram Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) prior to his appointment as the Chairman of MPSC. Mizo Students Union (MSU) had protested verbally over his appointment citing this could invite political interference as he was an active political party functionary. However, he occupied his office and function in its capacity. MSU further protested alleging dubious birth certificate of Pu Andrew Lalherliana and had repeatedly intended to organize picketing in order to prevent him from attending his office. However, these attempts have been thwarted again and again by the police acting upon intelligence inputs garnered by the CID(SB). It is learnt that MSU had given-up their protest upon him from occupying his office as his service extension is due to end on 31st October, 2015. At present he is being provided 2 PSOs.

 Threat perceived from other angles were also thoroughly assessed which includes possible threat from Insurgent groups, opposition political parties, NGOs and Civil organizations or even that could arise from personal enmity. It may be stated that by taking into account various aspects of possible threat viewed from different angles, the threat level perceived with regard to Pu Andrew Lalherliana is minimal at present.

Yours faithfully,
