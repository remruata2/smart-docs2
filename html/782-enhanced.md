****ALLEGED EXISTENCE OF SEPARATIST CAMPS IN MIZORAM****

 In a press statement released by Bangladesh at the end of the 51st Director General level talks between India's Border Security Force (BSF) and Bangladesh's Border Guards, Bangladesh (BGB) that were held in Guwahati, Assam recently, Border Guards Bangladesh claimed that armed separatist terror groups from Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts region had set up camps inside the Indian State of Mizoram.

 This claim, however, did not clarify which group it was referring in its statement. Nevertheless, the information goes viral in social media which can be accessed by all internet users.

 Long before this particular BSF-BGB talks, verification of alleged PCJSS (Bangladesh separatist group) Camps inside Mizoram have been conducted during the month of November 2019, March 2020 and recently during the month of December 2020.          

 While conducting these verification during the month of November 2019, it was ascertained that PCJSS were indeed having camps inside Mizoram along the Mizoram-Bangladesh border areas. During the process, instructions were also given to them to close these camps.****Locations of their camps were as under

a) Tipperaghat - Silkur camp (Lunglei District)

b) Bandiasora/Devasora camp, Tlabung Sub-Division (Lunglei District)

c) Terabonia/Salmur (Rejimond) camp, (Lunglei District)

d) Nakudsora camp, (Lunglei District)

e) Amsuri camp,Rajivnagar, (Mamit District)     

 When verification of the camps was again conducted during the month of March 2020, most of the housing of these camps were found to be dismantled and the cadres had moved inside Bangladesh, leaving only few un-armed cadres to complete the finishing jobs

 As per instruction from PHQ, the latest verification, conducted based on reported map references, during the early weeks of December, 2020 confirmed that PCJSS has completely vacated their camps inside Mizoram and that what is left of the said camps are merely make-shift resting places without any of their cadres.

 It may also be mentioned that no other militant groups of Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, other than the PCJSS, have camps inside Mizoram till date as per our information.

**Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS)** which means United People’s Party of the Chittagong Hill Tract is a political party formed to represent the people and indigenous tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. It has an Armed Group called Shanti Bahini(Peace Corps). It is considered as insurgent group in Bangladesh. The Shanti Bahini is made out of mostly members from the Chakma tribe. The Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord was signed between Bangladesh Government and PCJSS on 2nd December 1997.

 The major objectives of the peace accord were:

a)  Protection of land rights of the hill people.

b) Stimulation of their cultural uniqueness.

c) Rehabilitation of internally displaced people and refugees who had left their  country.

d)  Withdrawal of the military from the CHT(Chittagong Hill Tracts) with exception of permanent military establishments.

e)  Self Government through regional and district councils.     

 The PCJSS accused Bangladesh Government that the peace accord agreements are yet to be implemented despite more than 20 years had lapsed since the signing of the Peace Accord. Owing to this, their armed wing is still in operation and some of their armed cadres were in operation in the Indo-Bangladesh border areas until recently.
