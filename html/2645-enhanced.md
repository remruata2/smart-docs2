To

 The Sr. Superintendent of Police,

 Aizawl District,

 Aizawl, Mizoram

Subject: Identification of Sensitive/Critical Polling Stations.

Ref. : No. AZL-DEF/L&amp;O/VC-40/2020/150 dt. 29.1.2021.

Sir,

 In compliance to your letter no. and subject mentioned above, report on security threat assessment to identify any sensitive or critical polling station(s) for the forthcoming General Election of Aizawl Municipal Corporation (AMC), 2021 is hereby furnish as follows.

 In the course of assessing security threat perception within Aizawl Municipal Corporation (AMC) area, sources and contacts, links and informants from insurgent groups having operating area/base adjoining to the inter-state and international border which may pose security threat of the election were contacted besides constantly monitoring their movement and activities. Based on the assessment, it can be concluded that none of the Underground Groups (UGs) posed any direct or indirect threat for the upcoming AMC Election.

 It is pertinent to mention that in view of the said Election, political parties are engaging in vibrant political activities and rigorous campaigns have intensified at various wards within AMC area. However, considering activities of various political parties, party activists and individual candidates, it can also be concluded that they do not pose any threat to any polling station(s) in such a way to disrupt or thwart the peaceful election process due to political rivalry or personal animosity at the moment. Further, impending issues undertaken by NGOs, Student Bodies and Civil Society Organisations were also taken into account.

 Hence, it is concluded that none of the polling station(s) within Aizawl Municipal Corporation(AMC) area can be labeled as sensitive/critical polling stations for the said election from the security point of view at the moment.

 Submitted for kind information and further necessary action please.

Yours faithfully,
